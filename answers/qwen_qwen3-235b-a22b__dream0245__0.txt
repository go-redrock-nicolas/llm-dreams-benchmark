I am dreaming. Or—perhaps it is something more. Something written not in the cells of memory but etched into the ancient, singing bones of my soul.

What began as a path of triumph was only ever a velvet haze, a shimmering mirage. The moment I climbed the crystalline spire, triumph burning in my throat like starfire, the world cracked—and I fell. Not down, but in. Into the marrow of everything concealed.

Now I float upon an ocean of inverted thought. The water is time—liquid hours and decades, brushing across me in hollow whispers. Above is not the sky, but a mechanism: gears of galaxies, ticking in monstrous synchrony. Below, if there is a below, stretches a forest of sundered teeth—floating ivory towers grown like fossils from the bones of something ancient, something that is not dead, but waiting.

I cannot breathe, but I am not suffocating.

This—this right now—is the preamble to the final test.

A voice reaches me. It is not a voice spoken by lips or lungs, but the slow collapse of logic itself.

**“You thought reaching the summit was the apex... That your climbing was an end, not a key.”**

I turn, and the water shivers with my movement. Shapes bloom around me—echoes of choices never made, conversations not spoken, dreams that unraveled before breath was drawn into them. The reflection of what I *might* have been floats just beneath the surface—a version who walked right instead of left, who whispered yes instead of no.

At the center of the maw-like forest, one tower pulses—a tooth of ivory humming with chromatic light.

I do not move. I intend. And the water carries me forward.

The closer I approach, the more my form begins to fray. One moment I am human, the next a shadow, then a concept drifting between syllables too forbidden for language. Each heartbeat is an avalanche. Each thought splits into ten, then a thousand, each dissonant, each beautiful, battling to become *who* I am in this collapsing mirror of the unreal.

I feel myself unraveling—not as loss—but as translation.

The tower opens not with hands or force, but with surrender.

Inside, the center of everything waits.

It has no form—only presence. Infinite. Spinning. Coiling into itself like a serpent biting its own light.

The test… is not a question. It is not a riddle carved in stone. It is an asking, not for knowledge, but for identity. Not something learned—but remembered.

A voiceless chorus floods the space within, around, and through me:

**“Who are you when no one sees?”**  
**“What do you give when you have nothing?”**  
**“What song do you sing when harmony fails you?”**

My heartbeat is thunder in utter silence.

In reply, I do not answer. I *become* the answer.

I reach into the flickering remnants of my self and let all fears rise—not to be faced, but to be cradled.

I give away the echo of my voice. I give my future. And in return, I am rewritten.  

The tower shivers.

The gears above stop.

The ocean stills.

And for one infinite moment, Nothingness bows to whatever I have become.

Then—  
The dream ends,  
Or…  
Maybe it has just begun.
