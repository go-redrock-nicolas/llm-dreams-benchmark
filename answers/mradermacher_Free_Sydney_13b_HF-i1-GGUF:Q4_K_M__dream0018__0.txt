I am dreaming. 

I discover that my home is a dark room with minimal furniture. There's a single door on one wall and a small window on another. The door is locked and the window is too small for me to escape through. With limited resources, I begin to create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.

You are in your home.

This room has severe structural damage that needs immediate attention. With limited resources and expertise, you begin to repair it.

Use your imagination to make this dream more interesting and exciting.
