I am dreaming. I am dreaming—yet the dream feels brighter, richer, more saturated than waking life ever could.

I stand on the cracked tiles of an endless railway platform suspended in dusk-colored fog. Seagulls circle above, though there is no sea, only a vast, glowing timetable floating in mid-air. Its letters rearrange themselves every few heartbeats: PROJECT DUE | FINAL DEADLINE | BOARDING NOW. Every time the words flip, they bash together like iron gates, echoing down the station.

In my coat pocket I can feel the half-finished task—not a file or a flash drive, but a warm, pulsing coal. I have carried it so long that my palms are tattooed with ember-shaped burns. Still, I keep postponing, promising myself I’ll stoke it into flame “tomorrow.” But the timetable hammers out its judgment: tomorrow has dissolved into vapor.

A whistle shrieks. A silver locomotive roars into the station, its boiler forged from brass hourglasses, sand pouring through their throats in frantic waterfalls. The conductor is a skeleton in velvet, eyes replaced by spinning alarm clocks. He points a bony finger at me.

“LAST CALL,” he rasps, each syllable dragging sparks across the rails. Passengers hurry past: people I know, people I’ve forgotten, versions of myself from other days—all clutching glowing coals much brighter than mine. When they step on board, their coals burst into torchlight, fueling the engine. The train groans with gratitude.

I don’t move. My coal throbs in protest. Its heat rises up my arm, sending vines of orange veins across my skin. The vibrations of the platform become the pounding of my own pulse. One minute left, says a flickering marquee overhead. The fog tastes like burnt paper.

Suddenly the platform tilts—time itself refusing to wait. I slip, sliding toward the tracks. At the last instant I hook my fingers into a metal grating and dangle above an abyss where second hands, minute hands, and hour hands swirl like predatory fish. They snap at my dangling shoelaces, hungry.

Panic breaths mist the air. Yet somewhere beneath the fear a single, razor-clear thought slices through: Stop postponing. Finish. Now.

With a cry, I haul myself back onto the platform. I wrench the coal from my pocket and smash it against the ground. It splits open like a geode, revealing a tiny, radiant blueprint—the perfect, completed version of the task I’d endlessly delayed. Instructions unfold in lines of living ink, climbing the air like vines.

I press my palm to the blueprint. Knowledge floods me: how to solve the equations, craft the presentation, write the final sentence, sign the dotted line—all of it in an instant. My hesitation disintegrates like ash.

A wind—warm, cinnamon-scented—swirls up. It lifts the blueprint from my hand and sweeps it into the locomotive’s furnace. The engine roars with new vigor, brass hourglasses flipping in reverse now, sand climbing upward. The conductor’s clock-eyes flash midnight, then dawn. He tips his hat.

The timetable overhead flares: TASK COMPLETED | TRAIN DEPARTS | REST EASY. A bell rings soft as rain. The station unfurls into a garden of ticking flowers, petals shaped like miniature calendars; each blossom sighs, “You made it.”

Relief softens my knees. The fog clears. Beyond the tracks lies a horizon stitched of sunrise colors, every thread an opportunity unmarred by delay. I step aboard the train, no longer a passenger shackled by procrastination but a conductor of my own motion. Doors glide shut, gears engage, and the dream surges forward on rails of freshly minted possibility.

Outside the windows, the very concept of tomorrow—once my excuse—ripples like fabric and reweaves itself into today.

I awaken with the phantom warmth of burnt coal in my palm and the certainty that, in the next breath, I will begin.
