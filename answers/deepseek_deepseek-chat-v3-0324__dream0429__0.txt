I am dreaming. Vibrant colors swirl around me, shifting like liquid silk in the wind. The air hums with an electric charge, as though the atmosphere itself is alive with anticipation. I stand at the edge of a vast, mirrored lake, its surface so still it reflects the sky like a second universe below. But something is off—ripples begin to form, not from the wind, but from beneath, as if something long submerged is finally rising.  

A whisper curls around my ears, soft yet insistent: *"Look deeper."*  

I kneel at the water’s edge, my reflection staring back—but it isn’t quite me. The eyes are darker, shimmering with unshed tears. The mouth trembles, holding back words I’ve refused to speak. I reach out, and as my fingers break the surface, the water doesn’t feel cold. It’s warm, almost like blood.  

Then, the reflection moves on its own. It reaches up and grabs my wrist, pulling me in.  

I don’t resist.  

The plunge is silent, weightless. I sink into a world of liquid twilight, where shadows coil like living things. Faces emerge from the dark—versions of myself I’ve locked away. The furious one, teeth bared, fists clenched. The grieving one, hollow-eyed, clutching a chest full of unsaid goodbyes. The terrified one, small and trembling, whispering, *"What if I’m not enough?"*  

They circle me, not attacking, but waiting. *Acknowledgment.* That’s what they want.  

I reach out, and as my fingers brush the cheek of the grieving self, a shock runs through me—memories flood in, raw and unfiltered. Losses I buried under distractions. Love I was too afraid to claim. Rage I swallowed until it turned to poison.  

The water around me shudders, then begins to glow. The emotions don’t vanish, but they soften, weaving into me like threads of light. The reflection in the water is whole now—still me, but fuller, realer.  

A voice, my own yet not, echoes from the depths: *"You don’t have to be unbroken to be complete."*  

Then, the dream shifts. The lake becomes a river, carrying me upward, back to the surface. I break through, gasping—not into the same world, but into a dawn-streaked sky, the air sweet with the scent of rain-washed earth.  

I wake, not with a start, but with a slow, deep breath. The emotions linger, no longer shadows, but part of the landscape.  

And for the first time in a long time, I feel alive.
