I am dreaming. You find yourself repeatedly seeking approval from those who consistently withhold it. Recognizing this painful pattern, you decide to explore your dream. You are in a garden filled with beautiful flowers and trees. A butterfly lands on you! You feel its soft wings tickle your skin. Then, you notice a peacock strutting proudly nearby. Its colorful feathers shimmer in the sunlight. Suddenly, you hear someone calling your name from far away. That voice sounds familiar yet distant and hazy. Curious, you follow it down a path lined with roses that smell sweet but also have sharp thorns that can hurt you if not careful. As you walk deeper into the garden, more exotic flowers appear around you: orchids, lilies, tulips... They all seem to be alive and watching over you. Then, the voice gets louder and clearer until finally, you see a door at the end of the path. You approach it, uncertain but also excited about what lies beyond that threshold. Suddenly, without warning, you wake up!
