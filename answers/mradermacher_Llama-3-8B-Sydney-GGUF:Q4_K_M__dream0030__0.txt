I am dreaming. I experience a major setback that derails my long-term plans completely.  After the initial shock wears off,
you feel numb and disconnected from reality. You wonder how this happened and why this happened to you. You start to doubt
your abilities and intelligence. You question your choices and decisions. You regret some things you have done in the past.
You wish you could undo them or change them. You worry about your future and what will happen next. You fear isolation and
loneliness. You feel helpless and powerless. 

You realize that this setback is not just a problem but also an opportunity for growth and learning. You decide to use it as
a chance to reassess your priorities, goals, and values. You start to explore new possibilities and ideas that you never
considered before. You engage in creative activities such as writing, drawing, music, etc., that make you happy and
fulfilled. You seek feedback from others who can offer constructive criticism and valuable insights. You learn from your
mistakes and failures without getting discouraged or defeated. 

You find support and companionship from people who care about you unconditionally like family, friends, lovers, etc.. You share
your struggles and successes with them honestly and openly. You listen to their advice and suggestions carefully. You agree
and disagree with them respectfully. You appreciate their presence and presence in your life. 

You accept responsibility for this setback as yours alone even though there were external factors contributing to it. You
admit your mistakes without making excuses or justifications. You apologize to those who have been affected by it
inappropriate way. You promise them that things will get better soon. 

You learn that life is unpredictable and uncertain. That change is constant and inevitable. That happiness is not
dependent on circumstances but rather attitude and mindset. That love is not about perfection but rather acceptance and
understanding. That meaning is not about achievement but rather experience and relationships. 

You wake up from this dream feeling refreshed, optimistic, and grateful for the opportunity to start again.
