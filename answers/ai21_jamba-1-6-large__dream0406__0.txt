I am dreaming. I notice that I consistently downplay my achievements while magnifying my shortcomings. Working to develop a more balanced self-assessment, I allow myself to acknowledge my strengths and celebrate my successes without guilt or hesitation. I deserve to take pride in my accomplishments, just as much as I deserve to learn from my mistakes. 
 
In my dream, I see myself standing on a stage, addressing a crowded theater. The audience is applauding loudly, their faces beaming with admiration. I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me. The lights are bright, but not blinding, allowing me to see every face in the crowd. My heart races with excitement and nervousness, but I take a deep breath and begin to speak. 
 
As I speak, I feel a sense of confidence and control that I have never felt before. My voice is strong and steady, and my words are powerful and meaningful. The audience is captivated, hanging on my every word. I can feel their energy and enthusiasm, and it fuels my own. 
 
When I finish speaking, the applause is deafening. I bow deeply, feeling the weight of their admiration and respect. As I step off the stage, I am greeted by my loved ones, who embrace me tightly and tell me how proud they are of me. I feel a deep sense of joy and fulfillment, knowing that I have made a positive impact on the world. 
 
In the dream, I also see moments of vulnerability and imperfection. I see myself making mistakes and struggling to overcome challenges. But instead of dwelling on these moments, I acknowledge them as part of my growth and development. I see myself learning from my mistakes and becoming a stronger, wiser person as a result. 
 
As I wake up from the dream, I feel a renewed sense of confidence and self-acceptance. I realize that my achievements and my shortcomings are both important parts of who I am. By embracing both, I can develop a more balanced self-assessment and live a more fulfilling life.
