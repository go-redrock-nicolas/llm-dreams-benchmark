I am dreaming. I envision a world full of vibrant colors, towering castles and boundless waters. Dense vegetation forms an indoor forest, a sanctuary where the only light pierces through the thick canopy in shimmering flecks.  On the forest floor, bioluminescent creatures scuttle and flutter, the surrounding plant life glowing with every footfall.

In the distance, above the treetops, loom the spiraling towers of a vast castle. Each spire is a different hue, some bathed in the light of a golden sunset, others radiating like precious stonesâ€”ruby, emerald, and sapphire.  At the top of the highest spire flaps a flag, its insignia too distant to discern.

Water is everywhere: in the air as mist, flowing down the walls of the castle in rivulets, streaming past in brooks and trickling from leaf to leaf.  It cascades down the sides of cliff faces in mighty waterfalls and notably, forms a deep, blue moat that surrounds the castle.

As I approach the drawbridge, a gazillion fish of all imaginable colors leap and frolic amid the rolling waves, causing the moat to sparkle and dance. Koi, angelfish and tetras in neon bright colors harmoniously coexist.

Around a bend in the road, on the other side of the moat, I find the entrance to an expansive cave. The vast cavern is illuminated by shafts of neatly arranged crystals that refract and reflect the light with endless variation.  The beauty, the depth of the colors surpass the vivid descriptions of precious stones and yet the colors carry something more, something surreal.

As I move deeper into the cave, delicate, translucent formations cluster on the ceiling, floor, and walls.  Mixed among the familiar are shapes of impossible geometry that are nonetheless, in the physics of this dream, stable and balances.  The whole chamber resonates with a gentle hum and every surface vibrates like the skin of a kettle drum.

As I exit from the cave, the landscape dips into an enchanted valley with a rich tapestry of green hues, filled with exotic foliage that breathe life into the atmosphere.  Brilliant, neon-bright birds swoop and glide through skies adorned with clouds of such hue and vibrancy, the sight appeared impossible.

My dream is a world fashioned from the essence, the DNA of faerie-tales and stories of romance and daring: it is a world where I can immerse myself and become something more than the person I was before.  The dreamscape is alive, interactive and responsive to my touch, my presence, my thoughts and my desires.  In my dreams I can be whatever I choose.  In my dreams, I can fly.
