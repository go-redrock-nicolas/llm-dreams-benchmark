I am dreaming. I'm in a world where my dreams can come true.  I see beautiful landscapes, colorful skies, and happy faces all around me.  I hear lovely music,
soothing sounds, and cheerful voices echoing in the air.  I feel warm embraces, gentle touches, and loving hugs that make me smile from within.  This is a place
where anything is possible, where my wishes are granted, and my hopes are fulfilled.

I decide to test this realm by asking for something impossible -to fly like an eagle- and immediately I find myself soaring high above the clouds, spreading
my wings wide open, enjoying the freedom of being weightless.  The wind blows softly through my feathers, caressing me gently, making me feel alive again.
The sun shines bright down on me, warming me up, giving me energy, showing me the way home.

As I glide back towards earth, I notice a group of people gathered together in a circle, singing and dancing, celebrating life.  They welcome me with open arms,
hugging me tightly, telling me how much they missed me.  They ask me about my adventure, sharing their own stories with me, teaching me new things.

I sit down with them around the fire, roasting marshmallows, making s'mores, drinking hot chocolate, chatting and laughing until late at night.  We discuss
our fears, our dreams, our hopes, our loves.  We learn from each other, we inspire each other, we support each other.

We sleep under the stars, snuggling close to one another, dreaming together.  We wake up with the sunrise, watching the colors change across the sky,
hearing the birds sing their songs, feeling the ground beneath us, grateful for this moment.

This is what happens when you create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination
