I am dreaming. <|The dreaming begins|>

The air hums with the electric charge of possibility as I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, iridescent lake whose surface shimmers with colors not found in any earthly spectrum - hues of liquid twilight and molten opal shift like living oil paints beneath my touch. The shoreline is composed not of sand but of countless tiny mirrors, each fragment reflecting a subtly different version of myself: some dressed in elaborate societal costumes, others wild-haired and barefoot, their eyes blazing with unfiltered authenticity.

From the depths of the lake emerges a tremendous water clock, its clear panels filled with swirling galaxies rather than water, each cosmic current marking the passage of existential time rather than mechanical minutes. The clock's face has no numbers - instead, twelve doors of varying sizes rotate slowly, some ornate with gilded expectations, others simple and unadorned. As I watch, my reflections in the mirror-shore begin pulling at their costumes with increasing urgency, the fabric sometimes tearing to reveal glowing skin beneath, sometimes swallowing them whole until nothing but empty garments remain.

Suddenly the largest door on the water clock swings open with a sound like a velvet thunderclap, releasing a murmuration of paper birds - each one a page torn from different rulebooks, etiquette manuals, and social contracts. They swarm around my head in a dizzying ballet until one particularly determined cardinal, its feathers made from a folded love letter, perches on my shoulder and whispers: "The only dance worth learning is the one your bones remember when no one's watching."

At this, the lake's surface stills into a perfect pane, showing not my reflection but a vast underwater city where clockwork citizens move in synchronized precision above, while in the shadowy caverns below, luminous rebels paint murals that change with their heartbeat. The tension between these realms sends slow-motion shockwaves through the liquid atmosphere, making my teeth hum with the fundamental question: Which current will I let carry me tonight?
