I am dreaming. can feel the pulse of anxiety ripple through the packed subway car. The dim emergency lights flicker erratically, painting ghostly shadows across the faces of the passengers. There’s a sudden, eerie stillness punctuated only by the clatter of a distant can rolling along the floor, echoing in the cramped metal confines.

The train, an urban vessel usually so full of life and noise, now feels like a submerged wreck. I hear a child’s stifled whimper, her mother whispering reassurances as the dark cloaks us in its thick, oppressive embrace.

My eyes begin to adjust, picking out shapes in the half-light. Near my seat, an older man in a tweed jacket taps the floor with his cane, his face a tapestry of concern. Two teenagers huddle together, the dim glow of a phone casting a blue hue on their skin. A suited businessman looms in the aisle, his hand clenched tightly around the metal pole as if clutching to reality itself.

Despite the tightening tension, I feel an inexplicable pull, a curious yearning to explore this unexpected hiatus. Following an instinct buried deep within, I rise from my seat and carefully make my way through the murmurings of the crowd towards the end of the car, where I see a faint outline of a door, marked by a peculiar glow that seems unreal amidst the mechanical gloom.

As I gently push it open, the space beyond reveals itself not as another car, but as something wholly otherworldly. I step into a vibrant expanse where the ceiling forms a translucent dome that arches high above, framing a velvety sky dusted with impossibly bright stars. The ground is carpeted with verdant grass, soft and cool beneath my feet, glowing gently as though drawing light from some internal source.

Before me spreads an ethereal garden, its paths winding around enormous, luminescent flowers that sway gently as if in a celestial breeze. Their petals shimmer in all colors imaginable, their fragrance intoxicatingly sweet and unlike anything of this Earth. A stream of liquid crystal winds through the garden, its waters whispering secrets from a hundred unseen worlds as it babbles over stones of purest quartz.

I walk deeper into this dreamscape, each step taking me further from the reality I left behind. There is a zenith of calm here, an understanding that transcends language. The air hums with an unearthly music, a symphony conducted by the flickering constellations above. 

A figure emerges from the trees lining the garden path, an ephemeral being of light and shadow, its form shifting like smoke caught in a sunbeam. It gazes at me with eyes as deep as the universe, and though it speaks not a word, a torrent of images and emotions flood my consciousness. I see the lives of stars, the dance of galaxies, the birth of worlds—all in a heartbeat.

Suddenly, a soft chime resounds, shattering the spell. The subway jolts, and the carriage's electric lights buzz back to life. I'm back in the car, standing amidst confused murmurs and people beginning to relax as the train resumes its journey.

My heart beats a little faster, a silent smirk curls on my lips. It was just a moment, a blink of time, and yet, I carry with me a fragment of starlight, the echo of a dream too vivid to forget.
