I am dreaming. Let's explore this idea.

In the hazy, iridescent glow of the dreamscape, I stand at the edge of a grand ballroom that stretches endlessly, its walls flickering like mercury and its ceiling a swirling nebula of amethyst and gold. All eyes are drawn to me—not by choice, but by an invisible magnetism I wield effortlessly. My voice, a melody of honey and smoke, slips through the air, wrapping around clusters of strangers like silken chains. Their laughter blooms in synchrony with my practiced smiles, their secrets spilling into my palms like marbles of liquid glass. I dance between conversations, a phantom in a gilded mask, each word I utter tailored to mirror their deepest desires, their unspoken fears. They lean in, breathless, believing they’ve found a confidant, a kindred spirit—but behind my eyes, there is only stillness. Their warmth cannot thaw the ice in my veins. I am a mirror reflecting their longing, a cipher they mistake for a soul. And as the dream deepens, the room begins to unravel, faces melting into smoke, their adoration dissolving like sugar in rain. Alone among the ashes of their trust, I laugh—a sound like wind through bones—knowing that even here, in this lawless realm, I am both king and ghost. Untouchable. Unreal.
