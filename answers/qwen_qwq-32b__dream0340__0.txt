I am dreaming. The air smells like petrichor after a summer storm, and I can feel the weight of something ancient in my bones. I’m walking through a valley where the trees are made of glass, their branches refracting light into prisms that float lazily downward like reverse snow. A river flows here, but instead of water it’s a thick, syrupy liquid the color of oxidized copper. Its surface ripples with faint, bioluminescent glyphs that write and rewrite themselves in a language I don’t recognize. 

Up ahead, standing on the bank of the river, is a figure. They’re humanoid but not—skin like living mycelium, iridescent and pulsing with a slow, rhythmic pulse. Their face shifts constantly, features rearranging like clay in water. When they speak, it’s not through their mouth. The words come as vibrations in my molars, sensations in the marrow of my bones. 

“You count time in heartbeats,” they say. “I measure it in the decay of stars. Your ‘yesterday’ is my ‘epoch.’” 

I try to explain my childhood, the way my mother’s laugh sounded, the way the sun fell through her kitchen window. The figure’s form shivers, their mycelium skin blooming into filaments that reach toward me but dissolve before touching. 

“You think in linear causality,” they transmit. “I am everywhere at once in timelines branching like coral. Your ‘past’ is a story you keep inventing to explain the fracture in your now.” 

I show them a memory—a cold winter morning, the crunch of snow underfoot, the steam of my breath visible in the air. They taste it (I feel their curiosity as a pressure in my sinuses) and recoil. 

“Cold is a form of violence to you,” their voice is a chord of dissonant flutes. “To me, it’s a silence between echoes. Your senses are keyed to such fragile frequencies.” 

We circle each other, this way. I offer a joke about burnt toast; they hum a dissonant chord that makes my eardrums hemorrhage metaphorically. I describe the taste of blackberries; they vibrate a memory of supernovae collapsing into platinum. 

Finally, when the prismatic snow settles into the river and the glyphs freeze into temporary stillness, I realize we’ve shaped a crude understanding between us—not through language, but through the exchange of sensory sorrows and cosmic joys. We part ways knowing the chasm remains, but now there’s a tenuous rope of empathic fraying between us.\n
