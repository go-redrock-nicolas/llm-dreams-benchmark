I am dreaming. I find myself suddenly awake yet not awake, standing in the middle of a cobblestone plaza bathed in amber twilight. The air tastes faintly of cinnamon and salt. Around me, people bustle in clothing of impossible colors—fabrics that shift between shades with each movement, garments that seem to remember the shapes of their wearers from moments before.

I open my mouth to ask where I am, but the sound that emerges is musical and meaningless. A woman with eyes like polished obsidian turns to me, responds with a cascade of syllables like water over stones. Her words are beautiful but impenetrable.

My heart races as I realize my predicament—not a single sign, not a single word makes sense. The alphabet on storefronts curves and spirals, seeming to rearrange itself when I look directly at it.

I need directions, food, shelter. Drawing a breath, I mime eating, bringing invisible food to my lips. The obsidian-eyed woman smiles, nods knowingly. She gestures with hands that leave faint luminous trails in the air, pointing down a narrow street where lanterns float untethered.

Following her guidance, I walk beneath these hovering lights that seem to drift just ahead of me, as if lighting my way intentionally. When I glance back, the plaza has somehow vanished, replaced by a forest of crystal trees that chime gently in a windless evening.

A child approaches, offering me a fruit that pulses with its own inner light. I accept with a grateful bow, our shared humanity transcending our linguistic void. The first bite floods me with memories that aren't mine—swimming in an emerald sea, dancing beneath three moons, the feeling of feathers sprouting from fingers.

As night deepens, I communicate through improvised gestures, drawings in the dust, and somehow, through the sharing of memories conveyed by touch—when I place my hand on someone's shoulder, they understand my need for shelter.

An elderly man with fingers like twisted roots leads me to a dwelling that seems grown rather than built. Inside, shadows tell stories on the walls without need for translation. I understand everything and nothing simultaneously.

In this dream world, language fails but understanding deepens. The barriers between us are both insurmountable and meaningless. As I drift toward sleep within my dream, I realize that here, in this place of impossible communication, I have never felt more clearly heard.
