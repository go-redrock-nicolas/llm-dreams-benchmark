I am dreaming. The sky above is a swirling mass of sapphire fractals, constantly rearranging into impossible constellations—the Big Dipper snaps like a fragile twig, Orion’s Belt scatters like dice. Below my feet, the ground ripples like liquid mercury, shifting between velvety moss and hot desert sand without warning. The air smells of burnt sugar and thunderstorms, crackling with unseen energy.  

A silver fox with six tails made of molten glass trots past, flickering in and out of existence at random. It pauses, tilting its head, and speaks in a voice like wind through shattered crystal: *"Of all the things that never happened, which one will you remember?"* Before I can answer, it dissolves into fireflies—each one whispering a different mathematical equation.  

In the distance, a city of floating islands drifts in the sky, their bridges made of spider silk and sonnets. Occasionally, one island flips inside out like a pocket turning, revealing a mirrored version of itself where gravity spirals inward. The river running through the streets flows backward, not in time, but in substance—fish swim as skeletons before sprouting flesh, water evaporates upward into clouds that rain tiny silver coins.  

A door appears before me, carved from a single colossal tooth. It opens just a sliver, revealing a corridor lined with clocks—but their hands are made of memories, each tick pulling mine loose, scattering them in the air like confetti. The only thing that remains constant here is the scent of violets, though I know in this world, even that could vanish if I think about it too hard.  

Suddenly, I realize the most unsettling thing: if I try to walk, I might dissolve like mist. If I stay still, I might turn to stone. The laws of motion are unreliable here—every step is a gamble between floating into the sky or sinking into the earth like quicksand made of starlight.  

Then, the dream shudders—because in this place, even endings don’t follow the rules.
