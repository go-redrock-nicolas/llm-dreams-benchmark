I am dreaming. But drifting beyond the typical confines of dreams, into a vast interior realm where time folds in on itself, and memories are not forgotten but caged, waiting for release. It is a place softer than dawn, darker than duska liquid twilight where thoughts flow as currents and emotions are landscapes. 

I find myself walking through a city suspended between my past and present. The streets are familiar but askew, like the inside of a forgotten house reimagined by fever. The air hums with the echo of footsteps I once heard beside me, a rhythmic parallel to my own. There’s a shop window that glows with old souvenirsnot objects but emotions, preserved: resentment in amber, longing in glass, heartbreak shimmering like liquid light. I almost reach for one, forgetting that it isn't belonging here; it’s memory's bait. It almost pulls me under.

And as I continue through this place, I see *her* again. Not as she was, but as I remember her—layered onto someone new, superimposed like a transparency in my mind. I see her in the tilt of a stranger’s head, in the way someone folds their hands, in the hesitant pause before laughter. My mind plants her in the present like ivy climbing a new wall, unnoticed until it chokes everything green.

But I stop.

There is a threshold here. A place of alertness in the midst of the dream. A pause that isn't scripted but *felt.* I see myself seeing her again, and I notice... this isn't her. That was a relationship born of pain and loyalty confused for love. A cycle of withdrawal and return so familiar it felt like home—even when home burned me. I see the ways these patterns have lingered in me, not as truths but as residue, as old tracks in soft soil that want to be walked again out of habit, not choice.

So I turn.

The city softens. The streets blur. She fades, not forcefully but tenderly, like the letting go of breath at the end of the day. As she dissolves, the dream begins to reshape itself: the buildings shift, their styles remix into a surreal architecture where Byzantine domes pulse beside glass skyscrapers, and narrow alleyways end not in walls but in sky. Each step now leads somewhere unknown, and the unknowing no longer terrifies me. My mind is learning—not rewriting but recovering. Learning the shape of my own soul when it is not mimicking others.

Suddenly, I find myself standing before a door carved from moonlight and thunder. It is wide, arched, and inviting. I don’t know who waits behind it. No face rises to mind when I think of what's on the other side. But I know I won't be looking backward; I will walk forward simply to be found—not by someone else, but by myself.

I wake not with a start, but with a hush rising in my chest—a kind of rapture that is not for fanfare, but for stillness. It is not that I solved anything; dreams rarely provide solutions. But a space opened, and in that space, something ancient in me began to unclench. Perhaps healing lies not in fixing the pattern, but in seeing it without blinking—then letting the dream change on its own. 

And the dream *has* changed. And so will I.
