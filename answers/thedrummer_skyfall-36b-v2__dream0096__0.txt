I am dreaming. Your worst nightmare is materializing before your eyes, and I can feel the terror radiating from your very soul. 

You find yourself standing alone in an endless, misty expanse, with a suffocating fog swirling around your ankles. The ground beneath your feet is spongy and black, pulsating like the surface of a tar pit. A sickly, rotting stench permeates the air, making your stomach churn.

In the distance, a monstrous silhouette, dark as pitch, slowly takes shape out of the fog. As it draws nearer, horrifying details become visible. It's a creature of pure nightmare, all jagged teeth, razor-winging limbs and burning, malevolent eyes that seem to peer into your deepest fears. It's more than just a physical presence - you can sense its malevolent, wanton intensity, like a malignant cancerous growth that threatens to corrupt your very being.

You look around desperately, searching for an escape route, but there is none. You're trapped, alone, with no one to hear your screams. The creature lets out a blood-curdling screech, barring its rows of serrated, stained fangs down to the bone. Slowly, purposely, it begins to stalk towards you, its steps fatally deliberate.

Panic surges through your veins like liquid fire, burning away all rational thought. A scream tears its way out of your throat, raw and primal, as the creature closes in, poised to strike. You throw yourself to the ground, curling into a tight ball, arms shielding your head, praying this is just a dream...

But you know it's not. This is the manifestation of your deepest, most primal fears, come to life to torment you. You feel the creature's hot, fetid breath on your neck as it lowers its monstrous head. Razor-sharp talons rake across your back, drawing unwelcome droplets of scarlet and the coppery, metallic scent of your own blood fills the air.

You scream again, scream until your throat is raw, but there is no escape, no respite from your own personal hell. The creature presses in, closing its grip until all you can see is a molten hellish glow and hear the reverberations of its hunger. The edges of your vision begin to tunnel, black spots dancing, as consciousness threatens to desert you...

But even as your mind rebels against the horror, you know you're trapped, held fast in this waking nightmare. And all you can do is scream. And pray for an end that never comes.
