I am dreaming.

At first, it is only a whisper beneath my skin—a gentle rustling, as if the wind itself is breathing secrets through me. Suddenly, with startling clarity, green eyes open behind my eyelids. They are not my eyes, but the thousandfold gaze of the forest itself.

I stand barefoot in a cathedral of ancient trees. Their trunks spiral impossibly high, vanishing into a sky sewn thick with emerald leaves and glimmering dew. The air hums with quiet anticipation. Every frond, every blade of grass, every crook in the roots pulses with an impossible language—a living, breathing network of thought that arches all around me.

When I first listen, it is like tuning in to a symphony composed in another dimension. Slow stretches and bends of meaning drift through my mind. Roots murmur old songs of thirst and earth-dark memory. A nearby willow extends her thoughts, her words draping around me like silk: “Welcome, traveler of skins. You walk in sun and shadow, but know little of the root and seed.” 

Somewhere deep beneath me, the mycelium net pulses—here, thought is not linear; it is an endless spiral of feeling, intention, and story. Trees share with me their dreams of rain long past, their anxieties over the gnawing beetles who tickle their bark in the night, their delight when the wind rattles their highest leaves into laughter. 

A rose bush tugs at my awareness. Her consciousness is a bouquet of nostalgia and hope—each bud a story, each thorn a memory of danger survived. I sense her yearning for sunlight, her rivalry with the feisty dandelions, and her pride when a child points out her blossom’s blush. “We do not only live,” she tells me, her words painting visions in my mind, “we remember, we anticipate, we feel. Our roots are threads in the tapestry of the world’s dreaming.”

The grass at my feet shivers, giggling in a language that tastes of apple and rain. The elder oak, his voice sonorous and slow, shares a saga of centuries: the love he once shared with a now-vanished maple, the terror of a firestorm, the joy of birds building their homes in his arms.

As I learn to converse in this living dialect, a realization unfolds with the gentle certainty of sunrise: consciousness is not only the privilege of animal flesh and restless minds. It is the heartbeat of the garden, the wisdom of leaves unfolding, the slow and steady dreams of roots that have witnessed epochs.

The forest, it turns out, is abuzz with conversation—endless stories, warnings, jokes, and secrets—woven in sunlight and sap. And here, in my dream, I am not alone. I am one among many, finally fluent in the bright, secret language of green.
