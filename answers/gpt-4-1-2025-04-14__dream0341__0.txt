I am dreaming.

I awaken within the dream at the heart of an ancient, labyrinthine forest bathed in ethereal blue-green twilight, the kind that weaves shadows round your ankles and leaves you uncertain whether it is dawn or dusk. The night air hums with pulsing, unseen life, and the trees—titanic, gnarled giants—lean close together, their branches entwined like conspirators keeping secrets from the world.

I am not alone. Somewhere ahead, shivering amidst the sea of leshy ferns and moonlit moss, is a trembling child—no older than seven—with eyes luminous and wide as dew drops. I know, without knowing how I know, that this child’s fate is bound to mine. Their safety, their solace, is my responsibility, and the weight settles on me, dense and chilly, a mantle heavy as regret.

Suddenly, the forest floor tilts and groans, rumbling beneath trunks like the swelling of some ancient, world-sized beast. The trees blur and waver—something darker and colder than night seeps out from the roots, winding toward the frightened child. My own feet are leaden, boot-prints echoing like thunder on wood, but I surge forward, every muscle burning with purpose and dread.

I see the child's face, half-lit by a flicker of golden light bursting from my outstretched palm—a firefly swarm, born from hope or promise, I cannot tell. The ink-dark mist recoils as the tiny suns swarm, illuminating the way. I pull the child to my chest, feeling their fragile heartbeat flutter—like a captive bird—against my ribs.

Together, we dash through the living labyrinth. Each step tangles us deeper in vines of responsibility and terror, but the path glimmers faintly before us, paved by the courage I conjure for someone else's sake. The sky cracks open overhead—silver stars spill down, and I realize, with bone-deep certainty, that protecting this child is not a burden, but a calling that fills every hollow corner of my soul with purpose. Their trembling hand finds mine, and together, we run toward the promise of dawn, knowing that as long as the dream persists, I will not let go.
