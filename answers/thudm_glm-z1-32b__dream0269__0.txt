I am dreaming. realm beyond my waking thoughts.

I am reviewing a complex document filled with strange symbols and languages I cannot recognize. Each page pulses with a faint, otherworldly glow, as if illuminated from within.

One page has a symbol that looks familiar, but I can't place it. When I trace my finger over it, the ink runs like watercolor, blending into neighboring glyphs. The document shifts, rearranging the text into a new configuration.

I notice a tiny, golden thread binding the pages. As I pull it gently, the pages fall away to reveal a map stamped in fire. The world it depicts is unfamiliar, with rivers that flow upward and mountains floating in the void.

A voice whispers, "Choose a path." 
I touch a star on the map. The room dissolves into a tunnel of constellations, and I'm falling, but not moving. Time stretches like taffy. 

Three figures emerge from the darkness: the Weaver, the Chronophage, and the Echo. Each has a thread of their own. 

The Weaver's thread is tangled, suggesting past choices affecting present. The Chronophage's thread is devouring itself, a loop consuming time. The Echo's thread reverberates, reflecting but not creating.

I hold out my hand. My thread is a tangled mass, some golden, some black. The Weaver takes it, begins to unravel a knot. The Chronophage’s thread pierces mine, causing pain, but clarity. The Echo’s thread mirrors mine, creating a resonance so loud I wake up gasping.
