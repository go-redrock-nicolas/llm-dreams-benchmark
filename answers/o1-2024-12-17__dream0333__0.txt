I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in the middle of a grand atrium carved from smoky quartz. At first, the floor beneath your feet seems warm and alive, pulsing gently like a heartbeat and casting a soft, iridescent glow into the vast space. A spiral staircase ascends through a latticework of golden vines overhead. You can sense this entire realm shifting, as if the dream itself is catching its breath with anticipation.

In the center of this crystalline hall, a robed figure stands at a massive table strewn with maps—maps that flicker every time you blink, rearranging like living puzzles that can’t settle on a final design. The robed figure, with trembling hands, carefully places four brilliant, faceted stones on one of the maps. Each stone glows a different color: emerald green, sapphire blue, garnet red, and diamond white. You somehow know that the arrangement of these glowing stones will dictate the fate of vast lands, societies, and perhaps even entire realms. 

You watch the figure pause, uncertain. Their face is obscured by a hood of deep, swirling fabric that reflects galaxies and shooting stars. Something in your chest tugs, telling you that the figure is about to make a ruinous move—guided by an incomplete, misunderstood scrap of prophecy or myth. With a pang of clarity, you realize you hold the very piece of truth they are missing. You know how the stones should truly be arranged, or else nightmares will spill forth across countless dreamscapes.

An echoing voice resonates around you: “THE CHOICE… MUST BE MADE.” It repeats, whispery and insistent, as an unseen wind flickers through the atrium. The robed figure hesitates and lifts a trembling hand, about to place the glowing stone in a wrong alignment that will tilt the cosmic balance in dreadful ways.

Sweat beads on your forehead, though you feel oddly cold inside. A sense of urgency swells, crackling and electric, as though the entire dream is drawing in a breath, waiting for your next action. You know the truth. And you can see that your insight could spare this figure—and all who depend on them—cataclysmic consequences. Yet a question surfaces unbidden: Is it your place to alter this scene? To weave your knowledge into someone else’s fate?

Your heart thunders as you weigh the decision. If you reveal the correct method, you might save countless souls from a dark fate, but you risk exposing secrets that could unravel events that need to play out. If you remain silent, the figure will place the stone incorrectly, and the dream may spiral into a bleak horizon of chaos—but perhaps some hidden good might arise from that very chaos. So, within the shimmering, unsettled hush…

…you intervene. You step forward, your footsteps echoing across the quartz floor in soft chimes, like distant bells. Slowly, you reach across the shadowy gulf between you and the robed figure. “Listen,” you whisper, voice trembling with a slow-burning certainty. You deftly rearrange the stones, guiding each gem into its rightful resting place upon the living map. A hush falls, and for a moment the entire dream stills. The figure’s hood falls back ever so slightly, revealing eyes filled with equal parts wonder and relief. 

Light erupts from the stones—violet, gold, emerald—and the atrium’s walls illuminate as if the cosmos itself has poured inside. A muffled roar crescendos overhead. In that instant, you feel the atrium fracturing, as though it has been cracked open by cosmic brilliance. The blinding shift gives you the sense of weightlessness and disorientation that only dreams can conjure. And you think, just before the scene dissolves around you, that you catch a grateful, silent farewell floating in the luminescent air.

Then, slowly, the colors swirl, coalescing into the faint outlines of new shapes. You emerge breathless into the next segment of your dreamscape, carrying the knowledge that you spoke up, that you changed some monumental course. A sense of both triumph and wistfulness lingers like perfume in your mind. Perhaps you will never truly know the cascading effects of your intervention—or whether you would have found more meaning in silence. But as the dream renews, it’s enough to sense that for this moment, you chose to offer your truth, illuminating a path in the darkness, if only for a breath of dreaming time.
