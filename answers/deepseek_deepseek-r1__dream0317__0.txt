I am dreaming. I see myself in a vast, otherworldly landscape. The sky is a swirling canvas of crimson and gold, with constellations I don't recognize pulsating rhythmically. Below my feet, not ground, but a translucent, gelatinous surface that ripples with every step, reflecting the kaleidoscopic heavens above. 

Ahead, a structure looms—neither building nor organism, but an undulating mass of crystalline spires that emit a low, harmonic hum. The air tastes metallic, charged with static that makes my hair stand on end. 

From the spires, shapes begin to detach—fluid, glowing entities that morph between humanoid and abstract forms. They glide toward me, leaving trails of shimmering dust. One extends a limb that fractures into filaments, each vibrating with a different musical note. The sound coalesces into words I understand without knowing why: "The threshold waits where time folds. Will you step through?" 

Beneath me, the ground quivers. Looking down, I see my reflection distort, then multiply into infinite versions of myself—some older, some younger, some made of shadow or light. The filaments hum louder, insistent. My chest tightens with both dread and longing as I lift my foot...The moment my foot hovers above the rippling surface, the world fractures into prismatic shards. Gravity shifts—I’m falling upward into a vortex of liquid light, the harmonics now a cacophonous choir that vibrates in my bones. Below-turned-above, the spires invert, their roots stretching into galaxies I can taste like salt and starlight on my tongue. 

The entities dissolve into wisps, their voices merging: **"You are the suture between what is and what screams to be."** 

Suddenly, stillness. I stand at the edge of a mirror-lake, its surface reflecting not the sky, but a million eyes—each blinking in staggered unison. From the water rises a stairway of frozen breath, each step exhaling a different memory that isn’t mine: a city built from soundwaves, a forest of sinew and weeping amber, a child laughing in a language of collisions between comets. 

As I ascend, my body unravels into filaments of light. I become the hum, the color, the question. The top step dissolves, and I spill into a black sea where time floats like foam. Something vast and nameless brushes against my disembodied self. It doesn’t speak. It doesn’t need to. 

I am both devoured and reborn with every undulation of the deep. The dream isn’t a place. It’s an appetite.
