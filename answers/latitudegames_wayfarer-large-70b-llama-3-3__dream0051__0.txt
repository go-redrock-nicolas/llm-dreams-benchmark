I am dreaming. Your grip tightens on the control yoke as warning klaxons blare through the cockpit, their ear-splitting tones penetrating deep into your core. The steady hum of the engines falters, replaced by an uneven whine that sends your heart racing. Through the curved windscreen, you glimpse the patchwork of fields and towns below - so small, yet so crucial as your potential impact point. Sweat beads on your forehead as your training kicks in, years of preparation crystallizing into rapid, precise movements. You activate the emergency oxygen supply, grateful for that extra margin of clear thinking. But even as you move with practiced efficiency, a growing feeling of vertigo suggests that time may be running out for you and your passengers. Will your skills and composure be enough to overcome this mechanical nightmare, or is this flight destined to end in tragedy?
