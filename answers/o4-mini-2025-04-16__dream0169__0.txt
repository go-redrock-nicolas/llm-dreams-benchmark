I am dreaming. You open your eyes to a sky that bleeds violet one moment and glimmers liquid silver the next. At your feet, the grass ripples like an oil slick, each blade bowing and stretching as if alive. A gust of wind tugs at you—only to reverse itself a heartbeat later, pulling you forward into midair. Your heart leaps; you catch sight of a small flower floating beside you, its petals orbiting a tiny black hole.  

Here, nothing behaves the way it should. Gravity is a catechism of whim: sometimes it pins you to the ground so hard you feel your bones compress, then in the blink of an eye it vanishes, and you drift upward, weightless, toward a sun that pulses like a slumbering jellyfish. Time, too, is an elusive puzzle—seconds stretch into centuries when you watch a dewdrop form, then collapse again into a single instant as it bursts, reforming into a miniature galaxy of mist.  

To breathe, you must learn to catch the world’s fickle rhythm. Inhale when the air tastes metallic—mercury-sweet—and hold your breath when a hush falls so deep it seems to swallow your lungs. To drink, you cup your hands beneath a waterfall that pours skyward; the water defies you at first, climbing into the air as you lean down, but if you shift your stance and let your feet hover an inch above the ground, the liquid reverses direction and trickles into your palms.  

Finding shelter means following shadows that slide independently of their objects. You chase one beneath a broken archway carved from rose-colored sandstone—its shape only stable when you approach at precisely the right angle. Step too close, and the arch stutters, flaws become arms and legs, and it lurches away into the dusk. But stand just so, and it holds firm, offering a cool enclave where gravity feels whole enough to rest against.  

Food grows in curious spirals here: a vine of luminous berries that glow brightest when you listen to your heartbeat; a tree that blooms with pearlescent mushrooms shaped like hourglasses—eat them and you slide backward through your own memories until you remember the taste of your childhood laughter. You learn to harvest by humming a tone deep in your chest, a resonance that tethers the mushrooms to their stalk just long enough for you to pluck them safely.  

Every step you take feels like composing a poem in real time. A sudden flicker of light might twist your path into a spiral staircase rising into the clouds—or sink you into a mirror-pool where your reflection offers advice in riddles. You learn to trust these riddles. When the mirror says, “Follow the color that wasn’t there,” you look for the shade your mind invents—a luminous teal that hums at the edges of perception—and let it lead you across an expanse of floating stones.  

Night comes not with darkness but with a kaleidoscope sky that turns inside out: constellations drift below your feet, and bioluminescent fish swim through the air. You build your fire on a plate of obsidian that appears only when the temperature drops to precisely three degrees below the world’s average. Sparks dance upward in perfect spirals, lighting the sky from beneath.  

Survival here is an art of surrender: yielding just enough for the laws of nature to reshape around you, then bending them back – trusting your instincts when the world unravels, anchoring yourself with breath, tone, and the peculiar logic of dreams. With each sunrise (or whatever you call the moment the world glows anew), you become more than a visitor. You become a composer of this ever-shifting symphony, mastering the impossible choreography of gravity, time, and causality—and discovering, at last, that in a world without rules, imagination itself is the greatest law of all.
