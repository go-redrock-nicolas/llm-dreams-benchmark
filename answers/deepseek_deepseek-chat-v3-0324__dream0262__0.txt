I am dreaming. I stand in a city of breath and light, where buildings curve like whispered secrets against the shifting sky. The streets are rivers of liquid silver, pulsing with bioluminescent ripples, each step sending delicate fractals spiraling toward the horizon. The air hums with dissonant melodies, notes bending in defiance of known scales—music tuned to the frequency of forgotten constellations.  

Above me, the stars are not fixed points but living things—sentient flares of thought drifting like sparks from a celestial forge. They whisper in ultraviolet hues, painting the air with concepts no waking language could hold. One brushes past my shoulder, and in its wake, I taste the weight of an unwritten symphony, the scent of a color yet to exist.  

I am here to compose. But here, composition does not mean arranging notes—it means coaxing dreams into sound, weaving emotions from the vibrations of time itself. My instrument is not of wood or wire but of folded space, its keys made from compressed silence. When I press them, the air splits into parallel harmonies, frequencies intertwining like vines in a phantom jungle. The music I shape doesn’t just play—it *unfolds*, revealing hidden dimensions with each crescendo.  

Critics made of shadow and stardust gather, their forms rippling like heat mirages. They speak in riddles woven from every unplayed song in history, their voices overlapping like echoes in an infinite corridor. *Too predictable,* one murmurs, though nothing here follows known patterns. *Too familiar,* sighs another, though every note is born of impossibility.  

I press forward. My next chord unravels gravity; the city bends, streets arching upward into a living Mobius strip where past and future melodies collide. The stars shiver in recognition—this has never been done, yet somehow, it feels like a memory. The song swells, and suddenly, it *lives*. The sound takes shape, a fluid entity of light and longing, curling around the towers like a dragon made of resonance.  

The critics fall silent. Then, as one, they dissolve into laughter—not mockery, but wonder. The dream shudders, and I realize: I am not just composing music. I am dreaming the universe into new kinds of listening.  

And then—  
The sound becomes color.  
The color becomes thought.  
The thought becomes *you*.  

The vision trembles, and I wake.  

But the melody lingers—somewhere between a whisper and a scream.
