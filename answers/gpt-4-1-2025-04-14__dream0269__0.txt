I am dreaming.

My mind drifts through mist and shadow, until I find myself sitting at an ancient wooden desk bathed in golden lamplight. Towering shelves of books, written in languages I almost-but-don’t-quite understand, arch around me like the ribs of some cathedral library built by memory itself. The air is thick with the incense of old paper and possibility.

Before me, unfurled like a treasure map, is a document of such complexity it pulses and shifts when I blink. Letters shimmer, sentences rearrange themselves when I glance askew. Each paragraph glows with hidden intent, the margins alive with scribbled notations, as if past generations tried—and failed—to leave me warnings.

I run my finger along a line that ripples under my touch, feeling the weight of its meaning. My heart beats faster—I know that a single missed comma, a misread name, could ripple outward, setting off peculiar consequences: contracts signed with the wrong soul, doors opening to places best left locked, the past rewritten by accident.

Determined, I reach for a magnifying glass crafted of crystal and moonlight. Through it, the words yield their secrets. I notice a phrase disguised by ink so faint it vanishes at the edge of vision—an instruction woven into the text, meant to be found only by the most persistent reader. Decades or centuries press in as I squint, knowing that uncovering or overlooking this detail will tip the balance.

Sweat beads at my brow. A grandfather clock somewhere ticks louder, echoing like a deep-sea bell. I puzzle out the riddle hidden in the text, breath held, certain that this one moment teeters between catastrophe and revelation. The air seems electric, charged with the unspoken knowledge that what I find—or miss—will shape what comes next.

Above me, a stained-glass dome warps the moonlight into multicolored pools. Time slows. In that dreamlike hush, I choose to focus, determined to see what others never saw, and in doing so, become the unseen guardian at the edge of reality’s fragile weave.
