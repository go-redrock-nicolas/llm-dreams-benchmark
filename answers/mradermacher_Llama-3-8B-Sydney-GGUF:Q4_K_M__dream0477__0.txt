I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.  I see colors and shapes that defy description.  I hear sounds and melodies that touch my soul.  I feel emotions and sensations that challenge my boundaries. 
I follow my curiosity down rabbit holes and into secret gardens.  I explore new possibilities and create amazing things. 
I meet interesting people and charming creatures who teach me valuable lessons. 
I solve difficult problems and overcome formidable obstacles. 
I achieve great goals and fulfill important aspirations. 
I celebrate life and enjoy every moment. 
This is my dream come true.  This is where I belong.  This is who I am.
