I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**

You stand in a city that feels both alien and achingly familiar. The sky is a bruised violet, streaked with ribbons of liquid gold—like oil and molten metal swirling in a vortex above skyscrapers that twist and pulse like living organisms. The air hums with static, prickling your skin as though charged with the breath of a thousand unseen insects. A clock tower looms ahead, its face fractured into a kaleidoscope of numbers, each ticking backward, forward, sideways. Your palms are slick with sweat, clutching a crumpled slip of paper that reads, in handwriting not your own: *“They will not hear you. They cannot. The collapse is already here.”*  

You run. Cobblestones shift underfoot, morphing into glass that reflects not your face, but flickering silhouettes of strangers—faces contorted in laughter, mouths moving soundlessly. You scream warnings to them: *“The grid will fail! The sky is tearing!”* But your voice dissolves into wisps of smoke, curling upward to vanish in the gilded haze. A woman pauses, her eyes hollow black voids. “Darling,” she coos, gesturing to the bustling cafes where patrons sip drinks that glow neon-blue, “the world’s never been brighter.”  

The clock tower chimes. A single, reverberating note. Your chest tightens as the ground trembles, sending cracks spiderwebbing through the glass streets. Below, an abyss yawns, filled not with darkness but with static—a void humming with disjointed voices, radio static, and half-remembered lullabies. You stumble into a subway station, where commuters float inches above the ground, their bodies translucent, flickering like holograms. A child points to your trembling hands and giggles. “You’re bleeding starlight,” she says. You glance down: silver liquid drips from your fingertips, pooling into shapes that resemble constellations.  

**Twenty minutes left.**  

You commandeer a train, its doors etched with cryptic symbols that shift under your touch. The engine roars to life, hurtling through tunnels lined with mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of you: one drowning in a flood of ink, another laughing maniacally as cities burn, a third crumbling into ash. The intercom crackles. “*Reality is a consensus,*” a mechanized voice intones. “*You are alone in your truth.*”  

**Five minutes.**  

You burst onto a rooftop, the wind howling like a chorus of lost souls. The sky splits—a jagged seam revealing a second sky beyond, pitch-black and studded with inverted stars. Below, the city dissolves. Buildings fold inward like origami, people unravel into threads of light. You pull out your phone, record a final plea, but the video plays backward: your mouth stitching shut, tears rising into your eyes, words unspoken.  

**One minute.**  

A hand clasps your shoulder. You turn to see yourself—older, eyes weary but burning with resolve. “*Jump,*” they say, pointing to the rift above. “*Or become part of the noise.*”  

**Zero.**  

The world fractures into prismatic shards. You leap.  

Weightlessness.  

Then—silence.  

You wake with a gasp, your bedroom bathed in dawn’s first light. Outside, birds sing. Normalcy drapes the world like a blanket.  

But your palms still itch with silver.
