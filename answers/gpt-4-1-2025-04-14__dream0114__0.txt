I am dreaming. …feel as if I am floating in two worlds at once. The retreat is nestled in a clearing surrounded by ancient redwoods, their canopies knitting together a mosaic of sunlight and shadow—a living cathedral. The air hums with a peace I haven’t felt in years, yet underneath it pulses a tension as familiar as the ache in my chest.

Inside a spacious yurt, people gather, each one carrying an invisible satchel of grief and hope. I take my place in the circle, the cushion beneath me surprisingly firm, grounding. Candles flicker, sending spirals of warm honeyed light flickering across upturned faces. There is a low hum of anticipation as the first person, a woman with trembling hands, begins to share. Her words stumble at first, then gather flow—“I’ve spent so long hiding the way the world sometimes feels heavy and distant, like I’m submerged underwater…” My heart clenches. How could she know? These are my words, exactly—my silent struggle spoken aloud in a voice that quivers between breaking and healing.

One by one, others step forward, offering fragments of their own hurt. There is a man who admits to longing for connection yet being terrified of vulnerability. Another person describes the exhausting cycle of second-guessing every decision, paralyzed by fear of failing those they love. Each confession is a note in a quiet symphony that vibrates with recognition in my bones.

As the words flow, a delicate warmth fills the circle, knitting us together in a tapestry woven from shared wounds. I feel my defenses, normally thick as fortress walls, begin to shimmer and soften. I am both exposed and protected here. When it is my turn, tears prickle behind my eyes—not just from pain, but from the strange, exquisite relief of seeing myself reflected, not as an outcast, but as part of an aching, beautiful whole.

In this dream-place, I speak. I say things I have never voiced. And as I speak, it is as if the room breathes with me, holding my truth with a reverence and gentleness I never dared expect. My burdens lighten fractionally, replaced not by emptiness, but by the luminous thread of belonging. In this circle, my private pain is neither unique nor isolating. It is a bridge—fragile, glowing, and real—connecting me to others through the deepest parts of ourselves that yearn to be understood, and finally, finally are.
