I am dreaming. —I am dreaming.

Suddenly, the incessant pings and buzzing of digital notifications sweep around me like a ferocious swarm of neon-bright fireflies, each message flickering with seductive insistence. My hands, as if on invisible marionette strings, reach over and over to check glowing screens suspended in the misty air. The world around me blurs—a shifting city of phantom texts, unread messages pulsing in the walls of high-rise buildings, even the trees sprouting icons like bright, unnatural fruit.

But this time, in the churning heart of the dream, I pause. A silvery hush washes in, crashing softly against the persistent chatter of digital ghosts. I breathe in, slow and deliberate, tasting the air—rich with the scent of wild jasmine and dewdrops, the ancient perfume of presence itself.

I close my eyes. The notifications waver, their light dimming, shimmering uncertainly at the edges of my eyelids. With effort—and a quiet act of defiance—I reach not for a device, but for the earth beneath my feet. Cool, dense moss cushions my palms, grounding me. Every square inch tingles with life and possibility. I open my eyes and the world has transformed; the screens have dissolved into ephemeral wisps, drifting away on the morning breeze.

Free at last, my vision sharpens—details pouring in with dazzling clarity. Sunbeams carve golden pathways across the dreamscape. I hear birdsong, pure and ancient, spiraling upward on thermals of air. People's faces become luminous and present, their stories crackling in the air between us, unmediated and real.

In this vivid, awakened space, I walk forward, barefoot, the grass cool and impossibly green beneath me. The urge to check and check again loosens; my fingers learn stillness. Every heartbeat is an anchor tethering me to this crystalline moment—a dream where presence is not only possible, but absolute.
