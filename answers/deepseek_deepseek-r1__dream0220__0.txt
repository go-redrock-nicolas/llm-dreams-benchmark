I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Courtesies of Shadows**  

I find myself standing at the edge of a sprawling city where the air hums with dissonance. The sky is a bruise of violet and gold, threaded with clouds that unravel like broken threads. The streets pulse with a rhythm I don’t recognize: people collide into each other without apology, voices rise in jagged crescendos, and laughter sounds like shattered glass. A banner flaps above me, its jagged script declaring, *"To scorn is to honor; to wound is to love."*  

A woman with indigo hair and eyes like cracked porcelain grabs my arm. Her smile is a blade. "You’re too *quiet*," she sneers, and the crowd around us erupts in approval. I realize politeness here is a stain. Silence, a grave insult. To be cherished, one must be relentless—interrupt, provoke, bare teeth. Kindness is transactional, offered only after a duel of barbs.  

At a banquet hall, guests hurl plates against the walls; porcelain shards clatter like applause. A man in a feathered mask thrusts a goblet at me. "This wine tastes like sewage," he growls. When I hesitate, the room falls silent. Someone whispers, "*Stranger doesn’t know how to thank him*." I force myself to spit, "It’s revolting," and the crowd roars, clapping me on the back. My stomach churns.  

Courtship here is a battlefield. Lovers trade razor-edged letters, puncture skin to leave scars as tokens. In the market, a couple hisses insults, their fingers entwined like briars. "You’re a plague," one murmurs, tenderly. The intimacy of it stuns me.  

I meet a boy with eyes like smoldering coals. He teaches me the language of inverted courtsies: how to decline a gift with venom ("Keep your trash"), how to argue into the swelling dark until laughter spills like blood. But when I accidentally say "thank you," his face hardens. "Careful," he warns. "Authenticity is a lie here. You can’t *mean* it."  

That night, I dream within the dream: black roses bloom from my palms, thorns curling like question marks. Their petals dissolve into ash when touched gently, but thrive when I crush them.  

By dawn, I’m fluent in scorn. I shout at shopkeepers, sneer at poets, carve insults into mirrors. The city embraces me, yet I feel hollow—a puppet dancing on knife-edges. Until the boy finds me, his voice soft for the first time. "You’re trying too hard," he says. I slap him, per custom. He grins. "Now that’s honest."  

We sit in bruised silence, and for a moment, the rules dissolve. He hands me a wilted flower. "It’s dying," I say.  
"Exactly," he replies.  

When I wake, my cheeks are wet. The taste of ash lingers, sweet and bitter.
