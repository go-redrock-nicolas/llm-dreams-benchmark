I am dreaming. I am in a vast, luminous meadow that stretches infinitely into the distance. The sky above me is a swirling canvas of deep indigo and violet, dotted with constellations that seem to pulse with their own inner light. The air is filled with the scent of blooming night-blooming jasmine, sweet and intoxicating, blending with the earthy, damp aroma of freshly turned soil. 

The ground under my feet is soft and springy, like walking on a mattress of moss that shifts and molds to my steps. As I move forward, the grassy blades around me begin to glow a soft, ethereal green, creating rivers of light that flow around my ankles. 

Suddenly, I notice a cluster of glowing mushrooms not far ahead. They have caps that resemble opals—each one shimmering with a different hue of blue, green, and gold. As I approach, one of them emits a gentle, resonant hum that vibrates through my bones. 

When I reach out to touch it, the mushroom dissolves into a shower of stardust, which swirls around me in a dance. The stardust begins to coalesce into symbols and shapes—geometric patterns that twist into letters from forgotten languages, then unravel into constellations that I recognize. 

The meadow starts to shift around me. The ground ripples like water, and I find myself standing knee-deep in a liquid sky that has solidified into a stream. The stream flows upward into the sky, becoming a waterfall of liquid light that cascades into a distant constellation shaped like a spiral galaxy. 

In the distance, I see a structure forming—a cathedral made entirely of crystal, its spires reaching toward a black hole in the sky. The black hole is not ominous, but inviting, its event horizon shimmering with prismatic colors. The cathedral's entrance is guarded by a sphinx made of living mist, its body swirling with galaxies. 

As I step inside, the cathedral's interior is a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of myself. In one, I am surrounded by books that float and whisper; in another, I am standing atop a mountain of discarded ideas. The path through the labyrinth bends and twists, but I can feel the dream pulling me forward. 

At the center of the cathedral, there is a single crystal sphere floating in the void. When I touch it, the sphere erupts into a supernova of colors, and I am consumed by a rush of creativity. Ideas flood into my mind—solutions to problems I've struggled with, characters I want to write, melodies that form themselves. The sphere implodes back into itself, leaving a seed of light in my palm. 

I wake up, my heart racing, clutching the seed of light. The dream feels so real that I can still smell the jasmine and feel the stardust on my skin. I want to keep this seed alive, so I press it into the soil of a pot next to my bed. As I watch, it begins to sprout, reaching toward a constellation in my window, still glowing faintly with the colors of the dream.
