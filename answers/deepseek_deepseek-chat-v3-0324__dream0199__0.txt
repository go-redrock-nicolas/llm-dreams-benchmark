I am dreaming. At first, there is nothing—only an endless, formless void, pulsing with the silent hum of possibility. I blink, and with a single thought—*light*—the darkness shatters. A sky unfurls above me, but not one of simple blue. It swirls with liquid auroras, lavender and molten gold, bleeding across the expanse like spilled ink in water. Stars bloom where my gaze lingers, not as distant specks but as living things, pulsing like slow heartbeats, whispering secrets in ultraviolet hues.  

The ground beneath me shifts as I imagine it—not solid earth, but something alive. A living, breathing floor of glossy obsidian that contracts and expands like a sleeping beast. With each exhale, it trembles, sprouting fractal veins of silver light that race outward in hypnotic patterns. I kneel and press my palm to it, and the surface ripples like liquid, responding.  

A sudden urge—what if I could fly?  

I lift my arms, and the air itself obeys. The gravity dissolves as if I were a thought suspended in a vast mind. The horizon bends, warping like a reflection in a funhouse mirror, and I soar upward. Clouds spiral into existence as I ascend, not clouds of vapor, but shimmering, translucent structures—ribbons of iridescent silk that curl around me, whispering in voices just beyond comprehension.  

Below, the landscape rewrites itself. Mountains surge from the ground, their peaks snapping into crystalline spires that hum with deep, resonant tones, vibrating the very air. Rivers of liquid mercury carve serpentine paths through valleys of black sand, and trees of glass twist upward, their branches splitting into ever-smaller fractals until they dissolve into mist.  

With a laugh, I think—*what if the sky were ocean?*  

Instantly, the heavens invert. The stars become bioluminescent fish, darting in unseen currents. The clouds unravel into great jellyfish, trailing tendrils of neon light. I float suspended, caught between two depths—the world below and the swirling impossible sea above.  

Then, a figure emerges. Not quite human, not quite anything. A being woven from shadow and liquid gold, morphing with each step, its edges never solid. It speaks without speaking, its voice the rustling of leaves and the groan of tectonic plates.  

*"You shape the dream,"* it says. *"But who shapes you?"*  

The question lingers, and the dream shudders—reality flickers like a failing projection. For the briefest moment, I feel something deeper, something vast and unseen pulling the threads of even this boundless place.  

Then—I wake.
