I am dreaming. In this dream, there is a path glowing with an ethereal blue light that leads me into a serene meadow.  The air smells like rain-soaked earth and blooming jasmine.  I am guided by a wise old owl with feathers that shimmer in the moonlight.  It speaks in riddles about the interconnectedness of all things, whispering, "Every leaf, a universe; every breath, a starâ€™s sigh."  As I lie down, the sky above transforms into a liquid canvas where constellations swirl into fantastical creatures.  A tree older than time wraps its gnarled branches around me, its leaves producing a symphony when kissed by the wind.
