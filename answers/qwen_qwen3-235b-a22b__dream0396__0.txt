I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it is not heat—it is time itself, bending and rippling around you. You stand at the edge of a vast, iridescent forest where the trees are not trees at all, but colossal hourglasses, their glass trunks filled with liquid light. The sand at their bases shifts in impossible rhythms: sometimes cascading like waterfalls, sometimes freezing mid-fall, suspended in defiance of gravity. You step forward, and with each footfall, the ground pulses—a heartbeat synced not to your own, but to the tempo of your thoughts.  

A breeze carries whispers, fragments of conversations from lifetimes you’ve never lived. You hear a child laughing in one breath, a lover’s sigh in another, then the hollow static of an empty room decades from now. You realize the wind is not carrying sound—it is carrying *moments*, plucked from the fabric of your existence and scattered like confetti. You reach out to touch one, and suddenly you are *there*: sitting on a porch swing at age seven, sticky with lemonade, watching fireflies blink in slow motion. The memory is so vivid it aches, but when you blink, you’re back in the hourglass forest, your cheeks wet.  

You wander deeper, and the terrain shifts. The ground becomes a mosaic of clock faces, each ticking at a different speed. Some spin wildly, centuries flashing by in seconds; others crawl, a single second stretching into an eternity. You step onto one labeled “*Regret*” and time collapses. You are suddenly old, your bones creaking, skin parchment-thin. The world blurs into sepia tones. You stumble, but when you lift your foot, youth floods back—time here is a floor you walk across, not a river you float down.  

Ahead, a river materializes, its current flowing *upward*, carrying leaves that transform mid-ascension: green buds become autumn gold, then withered brown, then seeds spiraling back to soil. A boat drifts by, its prow carved into the shape of a question mark. The ferryman has no face, only a mirror. You board, and as the boat glides, your reflection fractures into versions of yourself—some you recognize, others you don’t. One wears a crown of thorns, another holds a baby, a third dissolves into smoke. “Time is a library,” the mirror whispers, “but the books are alive. They bite.”  

You wake in a cathedral of stars, constellations rearranging themselves into stories you’ve never heard. A comet streaks by, etching a scar across the sky that lingers for a heartbeat before healing. Here, time feels like a held breath—a single note vibrating in a vacuum, infinite yet fragile. You float, untethered, until a pulse—a *remembering*—anchors you.  

You are back in your bed, dawn bleeding through curtains. But the dream clings like perfume. You count your breaths, marveling at how each one stretches and contracts, a tiny eternity. For a moment, you swear you can hear the faint, rhythmic sigh of the hourglass forest, still ticking somewhere beyond the veil of waking.
