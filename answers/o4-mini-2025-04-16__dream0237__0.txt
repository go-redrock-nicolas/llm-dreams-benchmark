I am dreaming. I stand in the heart of a vast amphitheater carved from living jade, its moss-veined pillars spiraling upward into a sky woven of molten rose and sea-foam green. At one end of the arena, a figure in silver-scaled robes breathes out clouds of thunder; at the other, a companion draped in dusky bronze exhales ribbons of moonlight. Between them, the air trembles with unspoken grudge—ancient runes flicker across the marble floor, each rune a memory of betrayals so old they seem forgetful of their own origin. 

I step forward, my hands tracing patterns in the air. As I weave my fingers, the runes lift like broken shards of stained glass and hover around me, humming an otherworldly lullaby. Darkness pulses along their edges until I whisper a single word in a language that has no name. Instantly, the runes melt into silver motes that drift toward the two figures, wrapping around their ankles, their hearts, knotting gently like cords of remembrance. The thunder-breather’s roar softens to a purr, the moon-exhaler’s shine dims to a tender glow.  

But when I call upon the customary rites—shared meals of dreamfruit, the recitation of ancestral vows—their wounds tremble anew. The ancient sorrow will not yield. So I turn to the subterranean river that burbles beneath the arena floor: liquid mercury that reflects memories not yet lived. With cupped hands, I scoop its luminous flow and pour it into a chalice formed of intertwining roots and bone. The chalice catches starlight from five different constellations, each star singing in a unique dialect. Holding it high, I invite both parties to sip.  

As they lean in, the mercury-river’s mirror ripples through their sight: the thunder-breather sees herself cradling the moon-exhaler’s newborn child; the moon-exhaler feels the tremor of tears when the silver robes first brushed her cheek in a forgotten age of solidarity. They blink, astonished, as the jagged line between “you” and “me” dissolves into a tapestry of shared breath and blood. The amphitheater’s jade pillars sigh, releasing petals of emerald light that drift down like benediction.  

I awaken before dawn, still tasting the river’s mercury sweetness on my tongue, and I know that sometimes, when every familiar ritual has failed, only a dream so strange it bends reality can braid two wounded souls into one living promise.
