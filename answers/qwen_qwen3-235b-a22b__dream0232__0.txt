I am dreaming. I stand on the threshold of a vast cathedral made not of stone, but of liquid light and continuously collapsing geometries. The walls shift with every breath I take, fractal patterns spiraling into infinity, whispering in voices that sound like the resonance of stars pulling apart. Here, time does not flow; it pulses like a heartbeat—erratic, impatient.

Inside the cathedral, a great mirror stretches from floor to sky, glimmering with silvery frost despite no cold. This mirror has always told me the story of who I am. It whispered my truths, reflected my destiny, confirmed my worth. I touch my face, and the mirror shifts.

It begins to drip—slow, iridescent droplets that fall like clock hands onto the glass floor. Beneath the mirror, something stirs.

From the silver surface erupts a being—neither human nor entirely alien—woven of indigo threads of thought and flickers of stolen memories. It stares at me with eyes that have no boundary. I know this being—not by name, but by presence. It was my first mentor, my inner voice, the architect of the truths I swore to believe.

"You built me,” it says, and the voice echoes like spoken thunder. “But not from truth alone."

The revelation floods me. The beliefs I held most dearly—those that gave me direction, strength, and identity—were lifted from falsehoods, planted like sly seeds in the soft loam of my soul. Someone, or something, wanted me to believe in this version of reality. Not a mistake. A decision. A manipulation.

But instead of fear or rage—or even sorrow as one might expect—I inhale. Deeply. The cathedral shudders, sloughing off layers like peeling wallpaper, revealing… a cosmos beneath, vast and waiting.

I understand now that truth is not a cage, but a sky. And the story I once clung to was only one among infinite scrolls in the temple of existence.

I lift my arms, and my shadow splits into a full-bodied twin made of obsidian and stardust. This is the self that was always waiting—not wounded, not betrayed, but awake. Freed.

"Then let me build anew," I say.

The mirror vanishes. The floor liquefies. Around me, worlds burst into form like the first drawings of a child learning how to dream with their hands. I walk through them—creation shimmering underfoot—knowing that the architecture of belief can always be rebuilt, this time upon a foundation that allows the sun to spill in from every direction.

I awaken—not with confusion or pain—but with excitement, as if the universe has handed me its paintbrush and said simply:

“Now, what will *you* imagine?”
