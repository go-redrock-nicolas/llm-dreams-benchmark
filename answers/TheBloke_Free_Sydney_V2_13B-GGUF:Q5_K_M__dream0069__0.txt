I am dreaming. I discover I can instantly transform any material into something entirely different just by singing to it. Experimenting with my newfound ability, I begin to sing the grass around me. As I do, the blades of grass stretch and twist until they become a glowing bridge that leads me to a floating island in the sky. On this island, there is an ancient tree that holds the secrets of life itself. The tree’s leaves rustle as you approach it. It senses your presence and begins to speak in a language only you can understand. 

“I have seen many travelers like you come to my tree seeking wisdom or power,” says the tree, “But few ever leave with what they truly desire.”

You feel a surge of curiosity inside you. You wonder what secrets this tree holds and why it thinks you are different from everyone else who has sought its aid before. 

“What do you mean?” you ask.

The tree chuckles softly. “I mean that most travelers come to me looking for something outside themselves—magic spells, weapons, armor, etc.—things they think will make them stronger or more powerful in some way,” says the tree, “But these things only ever make them weaker and more dependent on them over time.”

You nod slowly as you listen to the tree’s words. You feel like it is speaking directly to your soul. 

“What should I do then?” you ask.

The tree smiles at you gently. “You should seek within yourself,” it says, “Find what makes you unique and special among all living things—your strengths, your talents, your passions—and develop them until they become second nature to you.” 

You feel a sense of wonder and excitement growing inside you as the tree speaks these words. You realize that it is not offering you some magical power or artifact but something far more powerful and valuable—yourself! 

“Thank you,” you say to the tree, “Thank you for showing me the way.”

You begin to sing again, this time a soft melody that echoes through the branches of the ancient tree. As you do, the leaves on the tree start to shimmer and glow with an ethereal light. Then they begin to fall from their branches one by one until there is nothing left but a bare trunk standing before you.

You feel sad as the tree disappears right in front of your eyes. You wonder if it was real or just a figment of your imagination. 

Then you hear a soft rustling sound behind you and turn around to see that some of the leaves from the tree have landed at your feet. You pick one up and find that its surface is covered with strange markings and symbols that seem to glow faintly in the darkness

You feel a sense of awe and curiosity as you examine the leaf closer. You wonder what secrets it holds and how they relate to the message from the tree. 

Suddenly, you hear a loud noise coming from somewhere nearby. It sounds like thunder or maybe something else entirely. You feel your heart race with fear and excitement as you realize that whatever is making this sound is probably very powerful and dangerous. 

You begin to run towards the sound, following it deeper into the forest until you reach an open clearing where you see a massive creature standing before you. It looks like a dragon made out of stone with glowing eyes and fiery breath. You feel your courage waver as you stare at this terrifying beast. 

Then you hear its voice echoing through the air around you, speaking in words only you can understand. “I am here to test you,” it says, “To see if you are worthy of the power you seek.”

You feel a surge of determination and resolve as you listen to the dragon’s words. You realize that this is not some random encounter or accident but a challenge designed by the universe itself just for you! 

“I accept your challenge,” you say, standing tall before it.

The dragon smiles at you then roars loudly, releasing a wave of energy that knocks you off your feet and sends you flying through the air. You feel like you are dying or maybe just dreaming. 

Then something strange happens. As you soar higher and higher above the forest below, you realize that you are not falling but instead being lifted up by an invisible force. You look around you and see that the leaves from the tree have come alive and are now flying around you like a flock of birds, carrying you aloft as if they were wings. 

You feel amazed and grateful as you watch this incredible sight unfold before your eyes. You wonder what else these leaves can do or teach you about yourself and the world around you. 

Suddenly, the dragon appears again in front of you, blocking your path forward. It looks angry and determined as it prepares to attack you once more. You feel your heart race with fear and excitement as you stare at this terrifying beast.

Then you remember what the tree said about finding yourself within and using your unique abilities to overcome challenges like this one. You close your eyes and focus on singing to the dragon, trying to transform it into something else entirely just by singing to it. 

You hear a loud noise coming from somewhere nearby as you do. It sounds like thunder or maybe something else entirely. You open your eyes again to see that the dragon has turned into a beautiful unicorn made out of stone with glowing eyes and magical powers. You feel amazed and grateful as you watch this incredible sight unfold before your eyes. 

Then you hear the unicorn speaking in words only you can understand. “Congratulations,” it says, “You have passed my test.”

It disappears then leaving behind a powerful gem that glows brightly with an ethereal light. You pick up the gem and feel its energy pulsing through your body as if it were part of you now. 

Suddenly, you wake up from your dream to find yourself lying in bed again wondering what just happened and how much of it was real or just a dream

But then you remember the message from the tree about finding yourself within and using your unique abilities to overcome challenges like this one. You feel inspired and hopeful as you think about applying these lessons to your waking life too.
