I am dreaming. …step through a door that is nothing more than a trembling sheet of moon-smoke—and suddenly the dream rearranges itself around you like a kaleidoscope snapping into a frightening new pattern.

You stand upon a floating chessboard made of midnight glass. Squares shimmer with trapped constellations; when you peer closely you can see Orion struggling inside one, Draco coiled in another. Only one safe path of squares blazes silver beneath your feet, and that path is sliding away, piece by piece, into a cobalt abyss. The rules of the board hum in a voice you somehow recognize as your own conscience:  

“Move with courage, or be swallowed by forgetting.”

A hot wind roars up from below, smelling of scorched cinnamon and distant thunderstorms. The first of the board’s guardians appears—an obsidian rook the height of a cathedral, its carved edges dripping liquid night. With every ponderous lurch it leaves behind fissures that crackle with bottled lightning. You sprint, the squares squealing like violin strings when your soles slap them.  

Ahead, an alabaster knight gallops in from nothingness—half statue, half comet, mane aflame with pages torn from a thousand unwritten journals. The rook behind you bellows; the knight before you lowers its horned helm. You have exactly one breath to act.

You remember, dimly, childhood afternoons spent learning the impossible L-shape of a knight’s leap. Trusting that memory, you vault sideways, then forward—an L of pure faith. The square you land on sings in triumph, flaring into a silver lily; the rook and the knight crash into each other, shattering into ribbons of black snow that melt before they touch the board.  

The path completes itself beneath you, clicking into place like a lock. You step onto the final square—and plunge.

Gravity unhooks. You fall upward through syrupy amber light, drifting into a garden suspended in an hourglass. At its center hangs the most difficult test yet: a mirror as wide as a lake and as thin as dragonfly wings, rippling with scenes of every defeat you’ve suffered in waking life—every forgotten promise, every sidelong glance loaded with doubt. The mirror speaks in a hush of rustling willow leaves:

“Face me with nothing hidden.”

The garden air thickens into perfume—jasmine braided with the nostalgia of first snow. Petals the color of moon-bone swirl, trying to blanket you in comforting illusion. But you’ve come too far for easy anaesthetic. Heart hammering, you step onto the mirror-lake; it accepts your weight like liquid memory.

Reflections bloom: you arguing with a loved one, you quitting moments before breakthrough, you drowning your own voice in polite silence. The glass wants to paralyze you with your own history. Instinct screams to turn away.

Instead you kneel, pressing both palms flat against the cold. “Yes,” you whisper, letting the word tremor out of the deepest vaults of your ribs. “Yes, that was me. But so is this.” You inhale all of it—shame, regret, ache—like drawing storm clouds into your lungs. On the exhale you release thunder: a roar of self-forgiveness.

Cracks radiate through the mirror, spider-silvery and luminous. It doesn’t shatter outward; it fractures inward, dissolving in concentric rings until nothing remains but clear air—and behind that, a door of pure dawnlight. Sunrays spill through, smelling of fresh earth and unopened adventure.

You step forward. The chessboard guardians, the storm winds, the perfumed petals—all swirl together behind you, merging into a single swirling aurora that threads itself into a cloak around your shoulders. It is warm, impossibly light, woven from every challenge survived.

The dawn-door swings wide. Somewhere in the waking world an alarm clock begins its prelude. But before the first chime can reach you, the dream grants its final gift: a whisper that nestles beneath your sternum like embers.

“You have seen your limits,” it says, “and found them porous.”

You smile into the newborn light—no longer running, no longer afraid—and step through just as the real day breaks.
