I am dreaming. I need to write a vivid and imaginative dream scene where I see a friend acting strangely. To make it engaging, I should focus on sensory details—sights, sounds, maybe even smells. I should set the scene in a surreal environment. The friend's actions should be unsettling but not too obvious. Maybe they're doing something that feels off, like speaking in riddles or moving unnaturally. Perhaps the environment mirrors their behavior, like shifting colors or distorted perspectives. Include elements of uncertainty—am I worried for them, or afraid of them? Need a strong opening image and a lingering sense of mystery at the end.
**Dream Journal Entry: The Clockwork Garden**

*The air hums with the scent of crushed jasmine and rust, metallic and sweet, as you find yourself standing in a garden where time drips like molasses. The sky isn’t sky at all—it’s a vast, ticking clockface, its golden gears grinding as sluggish violet clouds ooze between the numerals. Below, the flowers are all wrong: roses with petals of stained glass, tulips chiming like wind chimes in a breeze you can’t feel. And there, between the cobalt hedges, is your friend, Mira.*

*She’s arranging stones on a sundial that casts no shadow, her movements precise but jagged, as though her joints are hinged with rust. Her voice, when she speaks, isn’t hers—it’s layered, a chorus of whispers overlapping like pages torn from different books. “The moon ate its own teeth,” she murmurs, placing a pebble veined with glowing cracks. “Now it dreams in reverse.” Her eyes flicker, iris and pupil replaced by tiny, whirring cogs. When she blinks, you hear the click of a key turning in a lock.* 

*The garden reacts. A nearby fountain begins bleeding ink-black water that hisses as it hits the ground, sprouting thorned vines that pulse like veins. A flock of paper cranes—folded from maps of cities that don’t exist—flutter around her head, tearing at her hair with beakish corners. She doesn’t flinch. “Come closer,” she says, holding out a hand, but her fingers unravel into silver thread, stitching the air into symbols that hurt to look at. The smell of jasmine curdles into burnt sugar. You step back, and the ground beneath you cracks like eggshell, revealing a void filled with spiraling stars and the sound of a heartbeat played backward. When you look up again, Mira is gone. The sundial bleeds molten gold, and the garden folds in on itself, origami collapsing, until all that’s left is the echo of her laughter—a melody you used to know, warped into something frightened, and final.*  

*You wake with the taste of metal on your tongue, and the unshakable sense that a thread, somewhere, remains unstitched.*
