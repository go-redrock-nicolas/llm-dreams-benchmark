I am dreaming. I'm standing backstage, the heavy velvet curtain a deep crimson barrier between me and the expectant hush of the auditorium. My heart is a frantic hummingbird against my ribs, a counterpoint to the low murmur of anticipation from the other side. Tonight is the night. Years of sweat, tears, and relentless dedication have culminated in this single moment – the unveiling of 'Lumina', my kinetic sculpture, my soul poured into shimmering metal and pulsating light.

The air backstage crackles with nervous energy. Fellow artists offer tight smiles and encouraging whispers, their faces blurred portraits in the dim light. I clutch the activation remote, its cool plastic smooth against my damp palm. The stage manager gives me the five-minute cue, his voice echoing slightly in the cavernous space. I take a deep, shaky breath, trying to center myself, picturing Lumina in all its intended glory. It should be a symphony of movement and color, a living embodiment of hope emerging from chaos. Polished chrome arms are meant to sweep in graceful arcs, catching the specially designed spotlights, while embedded crystals refract the light into a thousand dancing rainbows. Its core, a sphere of intricately woven fiber optics, should pulse with a soft, ethereal glow, shifting through hues of twilight blue and dawn pink.

Confidence, fragile but present, begins to bloom in my chest. I rehearsed this reveal countless times in my studio, tweaking angles, calibrating speeds, ensuring every minute detail was perfect. This is my magnum opus, the work that will finally solidify my place in the art world.

The three-minute cue arrives. I straighten my slightly wrinkled jacket, smoothing down fabric that suddenly feels too tight. I glance towards the sliver of light escaping from beneath the curtain, imagining the sea of faces out there – critics, collectors, peers, all waiting to be mesmerized.

Then, a flicker. Not from the stage lights, but from within my own mind's eye. A sudden, jarring image of Lumina, but… wrong. Terribly wrong. I blink, trying to shake it off as pre-show jitters. But the image persists, growing sharper, more insistent.

I close my eyes, focusing intently, trying to conjure the perfect image I've held for so long. Instead, the flawed vision burns brighter. One of Lumina's main articulated arms, the one meant to represent resilience, hangs limply, like a broken wing. Its chrome finish, painstakingly polished to a mirror sheen, appears tarnished, streaked with something that looks disturbingly like rust.

Panic, cold and sharp, pierces through my excitement. No, it can't be. I checked it myself just this morning. Every joint was fluid, every surface immaculate.

But the mental image warps further. The embedded crystals, designed to shower the audience in dazzling light, look dull, lifeless, likechips of murky quartz. And the core, the very heart of the sculpture, isn't pulsing with gentle luminescence. It's emitting a sickly, sputtering yellow light, reminiscent of a dying streetlamp on a foggy night. The intricate fiber optics look frayed, tangled, a chaotic mess instead of a harmonious whole.

My breath catches in my throat. This isn't just a minor imperfection; these are fundamental flaws, betraying the very essence of the piece. Hope emerging from chaos? This looks like chaos devouring hope.

"One minute!" The stage manager's voice booms, snapping me back to the immediate reality. The house lights dim further. The expectant hush deepens, charged with imminence.

My mind races. How could this happen? Did I miss something? Was there a malfunction during transport? But nobody else seemed to notice anything amiss. The crew moved it with painstaking care. My assistants assured me everything was perfect.

I peek through the small gap where the curtains meet. The audience is a blur of indistinct shapes, but their focused attention is palpable, a heavy weight pressing down on me. They are ready to be amazed, to witness the birth of something beautiful. And I'm about to present them with… this broken thing.

My palms are sweating profusely now. The remote feels slippery, alien. The flaws I see are vivid, undeniable in my mind's eye, yet apparently invisible to everyone else. Am I hallucinating? Is the pressure finally cracking my perception?

The stage manager gives me the final nod. The majestic swell of introductory music begins to fill the auditorium. This is it. The point of no return.

Do I go out there? Do I activate Lumina and reveal this… grotesque caricature of my vision? Do I pretend not to see the limp arm, the tarnished metal, the dying light? The audience will see the movement, the shapes, but will they sense the underlying wrongness, the soul-deep flaws that scream failure only to me? Or worse, will they see it as I intended, and only I will be tortured by the knowledge of its hidden, horrifying imperfection?

The crimson curtain begins to part, revealing the stark, focused light of the stage. The music swells. The audience leans forward as one, their collective gaze a physical force. My feet feel rooted to the spot, encased in lead. Before me lies the stage, bathed in brilliant light, waiting for its centerpiece. Behind me, the comforting darkness of the backstage feels like a tempting escape. But in front of me, clear as day in my mind, stands Lumina – flawed, broken, a secret disaster only I can see, waiting for me to press the button and bring its compromised existence into the light. The weight of their expectation and my secret knowledge is crushing, and the world seems to tilt on its axis as I stand paralyzed, caught between the unbearable reality I perceive and the illusion everyone else is waiting to embrace. The dream holds me suspended in this agonizing moment of truth.
