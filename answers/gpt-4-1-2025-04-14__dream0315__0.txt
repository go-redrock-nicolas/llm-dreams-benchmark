I am dreaming.

I find myself drifting through vast, indigo skies, suspended above an endless, moonlit labyrinth. The air glimmers with the silent flutter of moths—silver-winged, luminescent—spiraling upward in tangled patterns. Each time I exhale, a trail of gold-tipped feathers floats from my lips and disappears into the breeze, whispering soft echoes of words I once knew.

Down below, the labyrinth pulses, alive and shifting. Its corridors are formed not of stone, but of growing vines and blooming nightflowers, their petals drifting open to reveal glowing clock faces in place of stamens. The clocks tick in unison, shining their hands as if casting a trail for me to follow.

A rustling in the shadows draws my attention; a slender deer, crowned not with antlers but with branching keys, steps softly through the undergrowth. It turns its dark gemstone eyes upon me, nodding as if urging me to enter the twisting maze.

I step lightly into the labyrinth, and everywhere I walk, I see recurring motifs: the silver moths, the gold feathers, the ticking clockflowers, and the deer with its crown of keys. They feel laden with meaning, urgent with purpose.

My dream-self tries to interpret their messages.

The moths, drawn always upward, seem to speak to longing—perhaps for transformation, or the restless pursuit of light even when surrounded by darkness. They flicker around my head, sometimes settling on my shoulders, as if urging me to embrace change and emergence.

The feathers spilling from my mouth seem to be symbols of truth unspoken, or thoughts set free. Their golden sheen suggests something precious—perhaps wisdom or honesty—that needs to be expressed without fear.

The clockflowers bloom wherever I hesitate, their glossy faces ticking away. I sense these measure not ordinary time, but moments of intuition, urging me to trust my inner rhythm and instinct instead of external pressures. They bloom brightest when I feel most certain of my path.

The deer, regal and gentle, with keys branching outward, seems guardian and guide. The keys rattle and chime softly when I draw near, suggesting doors yet unopened—potentials within myself waiting to be realized. Perhaps it beckons me to seek answers not by force, but with calm curiosity and receptive grace.

As I wander deeper and deeper into the shifting labyrinth, every recurring element pulses with amplified meaning. The dreamscape is saturated with light and shadow, with things mysterious yet achingly familiar. I realize the symbols are not random; they are pieces of myself, calling me toward self-understanding, daring me to unlock new aspects of my soul, nurture my most truthful voice, and emerge from this twilight maze radiant and transformed.

With this realization, the deer bows its head, the moths take flight, and the labyrinth’s walls dissolve into a sweep of dawn-colored mist—the dream at once ending, and only just beginning.
