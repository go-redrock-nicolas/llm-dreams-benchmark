I am dreaming. The air is thick with an otherworldly mist that shimmers like liquid mercury under a violet moon.  I find myself standing at the edge of a sprawling library, but the books here are alive— their leather spines writhing with tentacle-like seams, pages fluttering as if inhaling and exhaling.  Across the room, a clock tower looms, its hands spinning backward.  Each chime rings not in my ears, but directly into my ribcage, a sensation that both aches and reassures.  I step closer to a shelf, reaching for a book titled *The Anatomy of Forgotten Whispers*, and as my fingers brush the cover, the letters shift into phrases I once whispered in childhood, long buried.  The floor begins to liquefy, becoming a dark lake.  A figure emerges from its depths, silhouette faintly familiar yet distorted, its voice a chorus of my own deepest fears murmuring, “You left us when the hour was still…”  I wake, heart drumming like a trapped bird against my ribs.
