I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a grand, crescent-shaped auditorium, the hundreds of seats stretching out before me bathed in a warm, golden light. The air crackles with anticipation as a sea of expectant faces turn toward the ornate stage. My heart pounds in my chest, each beat a reminder of the turmoil of emotions swirling within me.

At the podium stands Jane, her manicured hands gripping the edges tightly as she surveys the crowd with pride. She begins to speak, her words carrying easily across the silent room. "I am honored to accept this prestigious award for our groundbreaking work in renewable energy. My tireless efforts and unwavering dedication have paid off, and I couldn't be more thrilled to be recognized for my achievements."

A knot forms in my stomach as I process her words. I remember countless late nights, early mornings, and weekends spent working alongside her on this project. My fingers flew across keyboards, my mind racing with innovative solutions to complex problems. Together, we overcame obstacles and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.

But now, as Jane basks in the praise of our colleagues and superiors, her speech making no mention of my contributions, a bitter taste fills my mouth. The auditor fills with applause, and faces I've known for years smile and clap for Jane's apparent solo achievement. Industry leaders and potential employers are here, taking notice of her supposed brilliance.

I try to push the thought away, reminding myself that recognition isn't everything, that the satisfaction of a job well done should be reward enough. But the dream twists and deepens, a kaleidoscope of past moments flashing through my mind. Late nights explaining concepts to Jane, patiently guiding her through processes she struggled to understand. Times when I suggested critical components that she then presented as her own ideas in team meetings. The way she took credit for my breakthroughs, as if the concepts had miraculously appeared in her own mind.

The audience thins as people file out, still buzzing with Jane's victory. A few approach her, shaking hands and offering congratulations. She glows with pride, entirely untroubled by the truth of our shared work. In the dream, I watch this scene unfold with growing anger and disillusionment, caught between my pride in what we truly accomplished together and my searing pain at being erased from that achievement.

As the last spectators depart, Jane notices me standing there. For a moment, uncertainty flits across her face. Then, with a practiced smile, she approaches. "Hey, great news, right? We really knocked this out of the park!" She extends her hand, the trophy glinting behind her, and I'm faced with the choice to either shake it, complicit in this fantasy of her solo triumph, or to stand my ground and demand the recognition I deserve.

The dream hangs suspended here, the tension between us crackling like a live wire. Time stretches out into infinity, each second a chance to respond, to change the course of this moment and all that follows.
