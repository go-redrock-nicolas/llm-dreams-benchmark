I am dreaming. In this dream, you find yourself standing at the entrance of a vast, echoing cathedral made not of stone, but of ribbons of color. Every pillar gleams, each strand swirling in blues and silvers, like moonlight woven into silk. The air smells of old parchment and something sweeter, perhaps sugared figs, though there are no fruits in sight—only tapestries depicting scenes of triumph and regret along the walls. Footsteps in the distance indicate you are not alone, yet when you peer around the swirling columns, you see no faces, only the dancing shift of kaleidoscopic shadows. 

A tremor of guilt runs through you. Somewhere in the hush of your mind, you recall a serious misstep: a hidden deed, a gross oversight, a hidden betrayal—something you wish you could undo but cannot. You realize that if anyone were to discover this error, it would crumble the fragile porcelain of your carefully crafted reputation. Already, your chest feels tight as if an unseen rope is drawing taut around your rib cage. You walk slowly forward, each step a faint echo over a mosaic floor that shifts like shimmering water, changing its pattern whenever you glance away. 

You see a dusty lectern in the center of the cathedral illuminated by a single shaft of pale light. Approaching, you find a massive ledger filled with page after page of handwritten confessions. The pages are weathered, some letters smudged, yet each line pulses with the faint glow of someone’s truths laid bare. As you flip through, seeking an entry you pray is not there, the question swirls in your thoughts: Should you unveil your own secret and risk the condemnation of all who read it? Or should you keep your silence, let the ledger remain untouched, and slip away into the cathedral’s endless corners?

Your breath catches; the next page is blank. You can almost feel your heart pound so forcefully that it rattles the walls. Words form in your head, a confession stirring like a secret tide. The swirling ribbons overhead seem to grow restless, their colors darkening from moonlit blues to bruised purples. Anxiety wraps itself around you as you glance over your shoulder, still expecting someone to materialize from the flickering columns and confront you. But no one appears.

With a trembling hand, you set your quill on the blank page of the ledger. It trembles in time with your heartbeat. The cathedral’s hush intensifies—every sound rings sharper, and your voice feels lodged in your throat. In that charged moment, you weigh your next action: speak your secret into this enchanted space, freeing yourself from the silent dread but risking everything you’ve built, or close the ledger, walk away, and carry the secret within you like a stain beneath your skin. 

And then, before you can decide, the ribbons of color overhead begin to unravel. They cascade down around you in a storm of shimmering strands, blocking out the blank page, the lectern, the swirling mosaic beneath your feet. You hear all those unseen footsteps converge behind you, a raw energy pressing closer. Your dream heart pounds in your ears. This is the pivot point—the choice that, once made, can never be undone. And in the midst of unspooling color, you realize you must act. You summon the courage to face your error—or flee its truth forever—just as the world around you begins to dissolve into light.
