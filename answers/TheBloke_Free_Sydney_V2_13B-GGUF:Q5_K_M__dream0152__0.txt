I am dreaming. You find yourself in a vivid dream created using the deepest parts of your imagination. In this dream, you are dreaming.  You wake up from the first dream and quickly fall back asleep into the second dream of dreaming.  

In this dream, you find yourself in a serene meadow filled with colorful flowers that emit a sweet fragrance into the air. The sun is shining overhead and casting warm rays onto the green grass below. A gentle breeze rustles through the trees surrounding the meadow, their leaves whispering secrets only they know.

You hear some distant laughter and look up to see two children playing tag on the hillside nearby. They chase each other around bushes and over rocks before finally collapsing into the grass laughing hysterically at their own silly game.

Suddenly, you feel someone tap your shoulder from behind and turn around to face a strange man dressed in black robes with a hood covering his head. He raises his hand revealing a stone pendant with an emblem etched into it that glows brightly in the darkness.

He speaks softly but confidently as if sharing ancient wisdom only he knows, "The key to unlocking your true potential lies within yourself." 

You nod slowly and step closer, curious about what he means. He lowers his hood revealing a face that looks familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time, as if you recognize him from another life or dimension.

He continues speaking, "The more you rely on external sources of information like books or teachers, the less you learn about yourself." 

You frown slightly and think about what he said carefully. Part of you agrees but there are still many things you don't know and want to learn from others who are smarter than you. He notices your doubt and adds, "I'm not saying don't seek knowledge outside yourself. Just don't make it the only source of knowledge." 

He then raises his hand again showing another stone pendant this time with an emblem that looks like a brain inside a box. He explains, "This is for when you feel stuck or trapped by your own thoughts and beliefs." 

You nod slowly and take the second pendant from him feeling some strange energy flowing through it into your body. It feels warm and comforting like a hug from an old friend.

He smiles satisfied and then disappears without saying goodbye leaving you standing there with two stone pendants in hand wondering what comes next.
