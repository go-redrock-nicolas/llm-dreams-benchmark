I am dreaming. Okay, I am dreaming...

The cave had been magnificent, a subterranean cathedral draped in crystalline formations that glittered like captured starlight under the beam of my headlamp. Each step echoed, a satisfying crunch on the mineral-rich floor, revealing chambers adorned with flowstone ribbons and stalactites like ancient chandeliers frozen mid-drip. I felt like a true explorer, pushing deeper into the Earth's secret heart, the air cool and damp against my skin, carrying the scent of wet stone and ages undisturbed.

Then, the world roared. It wasn't just sound; it was a physical blow, a deep, guttural growl emanating from the very rock surrounding me. The ground beneath my boots bucked violently, throwing me against a jagged wall. My headlamp smashed against the stone, the bright, reliable beam instantly extinguished, replaced by a pathetic, flickering sputter. Dust and pebbles rained down from the ceiling, stinging my face and filling the air with a choking cloud. The terrifying grinding and shearing sound of rock tearing itself apart echoed from the direction I'd come, culminating in a final, sickening *CRUMP* that felt utterly final.

Silence slammed down, heavier and more suffocating than the rockfall itself. The only light was the dying throb of my lamp, casting wild, elongated shadows that danced like mocking spirits on the cave walls. It pulsed weakly – once… twice… painting a fleeting grotesque image of a dripping stalactite that looked like a monstrous tooth, then… nothing.

Absolute darkness crashed in. Not just the absence of light, but a thick, velvety blackness that felt tangible, pressing against my eyes, my skin. It swallowed sound, muffled my own ragged breathing, which suddenly sounded obscenely loud in the tomb-like quiet. I blinked furiously, trying to force my eyes to adjust, but there was nothing *to* adjust to. It was the profound, infinite black of the deepest ocean trench, the void between stars.

Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through the initial shock. My heart hammered against my ribs like a trapped bird. I reached out, my fingers brushing against the cold, damp, slightly gritty surface of the cave wall. It was my only anchor in this disorienting emptiness. The air tasted thick with dust, carrying a faint, metallic tang – the smell of fractured rock. Somewhere, deeper in the cave, a single drop of water plinked with agonizing slowness, each tiny splash echoing unnervingly in the vast black.

I tried calling out, "Hello?" but the sound was swallowed instantly, barely leaving my lips before the oppressive darkness smothered it. Fear wasn't just mounting; it was a physical presence coiling in my stomach, tightening its icy grip around my throat. The path back was gone, sealed by tons of unforgiving rock. My light, my artificial sun, was dead. I was utterly blind, buried alive miles beneath the surface. The vast, unexplored darkness ahead felt less like an empty space and more like a waiting entity, ancient and indifferent. My fingers trembled against the cold stone as the full weight of my predicament crashed down upon me. Every tiny sound – the scuttling of unseen cave life, the distant groan of settling rock, the frantic thumping of my own pulse in my ears – became magnified, distorted, potentially hostile. I strained my ears, listening into the impenetrable black, wondering what else shared this subterranean prison with me now. The darkness felt alive, breathing silently around me, and I was terrifyingly, overwhelmingly alone.
