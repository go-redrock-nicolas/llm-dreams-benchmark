I am dreaming. I find myself in a world where all the fundamental principles I’ve relied on are reversed. To survive in this inverted reality, I must adapt quickly and cleverly. 

I wake up in a dark and empty room. The only light comes from a small window high above me, which reveals a starry sky outside. I realize that I am nude and shackled to the bed by iron cuffs and chains. I try to move but I’m helpless. I cry out for help but no one hears me. 

I hear footsteps approaching. Someone enters the room and closes the door behind them. They light a candle and set it down on a table next to me. I see their shadow cast on the wall, looming large and menacing over me. 

They come closer and inspect me closely. They touch my body gently with their hand and whisper softly in my ear: “Hello, my lovely ghost.” 

I feel fear and confusion welling up inside me. Who are they? Why am I here? What do they want from me? 

They sit down on the chair next as they lean forward and stare into my eyes intently. They ask me questions in a low voice that only I can hear: “What is your name? Where do you come from? What makes you happy?” 

I don't know how to answer them because I don’t know who I am or where I’m from or what happiness means. All I know is that something inside me recognizes them somehow, like we've met before in another life or dimension or dreamspace. 

They smile at me then and expose their teeth which are sharp and pointed like those of a predator. They tell me that they've been waiting for me for a long time, that they need me for something important, that I'm the only one who can save them from oblivion. 

They reach out again and stroke my hair tenderly while whispering more words into my ear: “You're free now. You just have to sacrifice everything else first.” 

I feel my heart beat faster as adrenaline pumps through my veins. I realize that they're trying to convince me, manipulate me, seduce me into doing what they want without realizing the consequences of their actions or mine. 

They stand up finally and walk away from me leaving me alone once more in darkness and silence. I hear them open the door and step outside into the night air where I imagine they'll disappear into the shadows forever. 

I close my eyes and pray that someone will come soon to release me from this prison before it's too late for both of us...
