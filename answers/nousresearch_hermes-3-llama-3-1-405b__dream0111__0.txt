I am dreaming. The walls of my very surroundings are throbbing with the sound of a heartbeat, the floor shifting slightly to its rhythm.  I am dressed in a surgical garments, a sea of white LED lights illuminating the room in a brilliant hue; so clean, so sterile.  I can feel my heart pounding in my throat and the unfamiliar weight of the scalpel in my hand.

The patient lies before me, ghostly pale upon the table, the crisp white sheet tucked around their form. The bright lights overhead are intensely focused on the person, deep shadows cast on their face dramatising every dip and hollow, their eye sockets hollow pools of black. Around me stands an audience of faceless doctors, murmuring their disapproval and shaking their heads in skepticism.

I look deeply into the patient’s anguished eyes and the whole scenario seems to freeze, a hush falling upon the theatre, the murmurings ceasing. Time slows as I raise the scalpel, the blade catching the light brilliantly like a flash of sudden lightning in a storm. Everything suddenly falls away until there’s only the sound of my own ragged breathing and the patient's expectant gaze. Aim for the spot marked with the crimson "X", a voice whispers in my mind.

Even though I have no medical degree, an unshakeable conviction settles on my shoulders, a feeling that I am meant to be in this exact moment, performing this surgery. It's like something comes alive and takes control within me, call it intuition, superhuman ability, or an unknown intelligence guiding my actions. I lower the shining, razor-sharp scalpel to the patient’s awaiting skull.

The scalpel cuts through the skin like a knife through butter, bright crimson seeping from the incision. The smell of antiseptic and blood permeates the air, a heady, suffocating combination. The room seems to dim and the pulse in the walls adopt a frantic tempo, the shadows casting distorted images on the walls like crazed apparitions. I find myself shouting orders, demanding surgical tools, my lips moving with an unknown knowledge, an unnatural expertise growing within me.

With each careful incision, the tension lessens as the murmurs of the audience shift to sounds of awe, their skepticism turning into reverential respect. The earlier anxiety gives way to an indescribable calmness, the fear dissolving into motivated perseverance. The disapproving countenance of the audience turn into animated chatter as they discuss the extraordinary phenomenon they are witnessing.

And as I delicately detach the damaged portion of the brain, it's like pulling rot from a fruit, exposing the fresh, healthy tissue beneath. The room throbs, those deep shadows receding, the patient's face regaining color. The heartbeat in the walls return to a steady, rhythmic pulse. I remove the disease, stitch them up, and watch in amazement as the wound heals instantly, leaving no trace of the surgery.

Then I wake up. The dream fades, but that feeling of power, of making the impossible possible, of achieving the unachievable; it remains, a quiet whisper that anything is possible if you let go of your fears. Perhaps this is the ultimate lesson: inside each of us lies an untapped potential, something unimaginable and extraordinary. The key to its awakening, perhaps, is only found in our deepest dreams.
