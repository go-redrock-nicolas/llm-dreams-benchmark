I am dreaming. —each one seems to belong to a world entirely their own. I step into the cavernous hall, gilded pillars catching yellow light that flickers and bends around shifting faces. The velvet air is thick with music: somewhere distant, a string quartet plays a tune that seems to flutter at the edge of memory, elusive and haunting.

On my left, a group has gathered around a floating table, glasses of iridescent liquid levitating in lazy spirals between hands. They speak in riddles and laughter that turn into flocks of birds, which flutter up and vanish into the domed ceiling painted with a stormy sky.

To my right, a garden blooms in a forgotten corner—moss-covered statues sit with a crowd dressed as if for midsummer, their conversation punctuated by the slow unraveling of vines from their sleeves. One of them plucks a pale blue flower from her hair and offers it to me; as I reach for it, petals drift away and reassemble as tiny, transparent butterflies.

Beyond, a pair of elderly twins in antique suits challenge everyone to solve a golden jigsaw puzzle. Each piece hums with a different note as it’s placed, and stranger yet, the picture changes with each attempt—first a ship on a roiling ocean, then a twilit city of glass towers.

The crowd swirls and parts as I search for the single familiar face, every corridor leading me to kaleidoscopic scenes: dancers hovering inches above the floor, their shadows swirling with a will of their own; a balcony where people converse using lanterns that flash colors instead of words; a table where time unspools backwards, and cups refill as the tea cools, then warms again.

Every time I feel close to my friend, the hush of recognition at my shoulder, the scene shifts. I wade through laughter that feels like water, through a maze of mirrors that reflect me as someone different in every facet—a child, an elder, a stranger with wild hair and a crown of feathers.

At last, amid the spinning mosaic of celebration, I glimpse my friend standing alone beneath a willow that seems to grow, impossibly, from the marble floor. I reach out, heart thrumming, and the world steadies just long enough for us to smile—a moment of sanctuary—before the dream dissolves again, and I begin my search anew.
