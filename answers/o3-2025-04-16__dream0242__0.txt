I am dreaming. …breathe in a lung-full of copper-tasting air and watch the control-room lights strobe like anxious fireflies. Alarms yowl in mismatched keys, the sirens stretching and shrinking as though time itself has hiccupped. On the wall-length schematic, every coolant loop glows crimson: Loop A, Loop B, the once-redundant Loop C—each flickers, falters, fails. Steam roils through ventilation grates, curling into impossible shapes—one plume becomes a swan of pure mercury, another a weeping willow made of sparks.  

Your fingers skitter across the console, but the keys have turned to polished piano ivory; when you press them, they thrum like distant whale song instead of triggering any sensible command. Outside the thick, bomb-glass viewport, the reactor dome seems to breathe, exhaling blue-white Cherenkov light that pulses like a giant heartbeat.  

A voice crackles over the intercom—your own voice, but younger, terrified and echoing as if down a long, metal throat. “Containment integrity… ninety-seven… eighty-four… sixty-two…” The numbers tumble in free fall. A second self appears beside you wearing the same irradiated jumpsuit, eyes whirling with galaxies; it leans in and whispers, “Not everything that fails must break. Dream logic can bend.”  

With conventional reality crumbling, you decide to abandon ordinary physics altogether. You punch an oversized EMERGENCY OVERRIDE button that rises out of nowhere like a mushroom. Instead of shutting systems down, it tears the ceiling away, revealing a night sky where constellations have rearranged themselves into warning glyphs. One star falls—then another—then a thousand, each sizzling into the control room as glowing cinders that swarm together, knitting themselves into a shimmering, translucent phoenix.  

The phoenix spreads its wings, and all readings on your monitors invert: temperatures plunge, radiation levels flow backwards into negative digits, pressure gauges tick down as though rewinding. The reactor core, visible now as a luminous sphere, cracks open like an egg in slow motion; yet instead of fissile fury, it releases clouds of floating cherry blossoms, their petals etched with microscopic mathematical runes.  

You step forward, weightless. Alarms transmute into distant cathedral bells, chanting a lullaby in a language you somehow understand—an exhortation to hope, or maybe to wake. The facility’s corridors elongate into an infinite tunnel. At its far end waits either salvation or singularity; you cannot tell.  

Resolute, you stride toward the tunnel. Each footfall shatters into prismatic glass that reforms behind you. The phoenix coils around the core like a guardian serpent, its feathers weaving a quantum dreamcatcher that collects every stray neutron before it can do harm. Catastrophe pauses on the threshold, blinking in confusion, unsure if it still has permission to exist.  

A final tremor ripples underfoot. Systems once again announce themselves: “Containment restored… coolant stable… all functions nominal.” The control-room doors blossom into a field of sunlit poppies, and somewhere, someone blows out a candle. Darkness swoops in—soft, velvety, reassuring.  

You wake, heart hammering, half-expecting Geiger clicks and scarlet alarms. But all you hear is the slow, steady whisper of morning rain against the window, and the faint echo of a phoenix settling its wings somewhere far inside your mind.
