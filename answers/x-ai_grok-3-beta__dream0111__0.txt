I am dreaming. You're dreaming, and the air around you is thick with an electric tension, a surreal hush that seems to pulse with every beat of your racing heart. You stand in a cavernous operating theater, the walls a gleaming, otherworldly chrome that reflects distorted, ghostly versions of yourself in every direction. The lights above are blinding, casting stark, clinical beams that carve sharp shadows across the sterile environment. The scent of antiseptic stings your nostrils, mingling with an unplaceable, metallic tang that lingers on your tongue like a forgotten memory.

Before you lies the patient, draped in pale green fabric that seems to shimmer faintly, almost as if woven from moonlight. Their face is obscured, but you can feel the weight of their trust—or perhaps their desperation—pressing down on your shoulders like a physical force. Their chest rises and falls in a slow, rhythmic dance, each breath a silent plea for you to succeed. You have no medical training, no years of study or practice to guide your hands, yet here you are, tasked with the impossible: brain surgery, the most delicate and intricate of procedures. The gravity of the moment is suffocating, a heavy fog that clouds your mind even as your senses sharpen to an almost painful clarity.

In your trembling grasp, you hold a scalpel, its blade so fine it seems to hum with a life of its own. It glints under the harsh lights, a sliver of icy silver that feels both foreign and disturbingly familiar, as if you've wielded it in another life, another dream. Your fingers, slick with nervous sweat beneath the thin latex gloves, threaten to betray you with every quiver. The weight of the instrument is negligible, yet it feels like you're holding the entire world in your palm—the life of this faceless stranger, the fragile thread of their existence, all hinging on your untested abilities.

Around you, ghostly figures clad in surgical masks and gowns hover like specters, their eyes hidden but their presence suffocating. They murmur in a language you can't comprehend, a low chant that weaves through the air like a spell, urging you forward. Are they guiding you or mocking you? You can't tell. The sound of their voices blends with the rhythmic beeping of unseen monitors, a heartbeat of technology that mirrors your own frantic pulse.

You take a deep breath, the cold air searing your lungs, and lower the scalpel toward the patient’s exposed scalp, where a faint red line has already been drawn by some unseen hand—a map to the unknown. The skin seems to glow softly, almost translucent, revealing a labyrinth of veins beneath, pulsing with life. Your mind reels with doubt—What if I cut too deep? What if I falter? What if I'm not meant to do this?—but there’s no time for hesitation. The patient’s life hangs in a precarious balance, and you are their only hope, improbable as that may seem.

As the blade touches skin, the world shifts. The operating theater ripples like water disturbed by a stone, and suddenly, you're not just cutting into flesh but into memory itself. Each incision releases a burst of color and sound—flashes of the patient’s life flood your vision: a child’s laughter echoing through a sun-drenched meadow, the salty sting of ocean spray on a windswept cliff, the quiet sorrow of a rainy evening spent alone. You’re not just a surgeon; you’re an intruder in the sacred landscape of someone’s mind, peeling back layers of their deepest secrets with every hesitant slice.

But then, something dark stirs beneath the surface. A shadow pulses within the exposed tissue, a writhing, ink-black mass that seems to stare back at you with malevolent intent. It whispers in a voice that chills your blood, promising failure, promising pain. Your hands shake violently now, the scalpel slipping as the shadow grows, tendrils reaching out as if to drag you into its depths. The ghostly figures around you begin to wail, their chants turning to screams, and the monitors shriek in a discordant cacophony as the patient’s heartbeat stutters.

You’re paralyzed, caught between terror and determination. Do you press on, risking everything to banish this darkness, or do you pull away, knowing that retreat might mean death—for the patient, for you, or for something far greater? Sweat beads on your forehead, dripping down into your eyes, stinging with the salt of your fear. The scalpel hovers, trembling, as the shadow laughs—a sound that reverberates through the very marrow of your bones.

And in this moment, as the dream teeters on the edge of nightmare, you feel the weight of every choice you’ve ever made, every doubt you’ve ever harbored, crystallizing into this single, impossible act. You are no doctor, no healer, yet here you stand, at the precipice of life and death, with a stranger’s soul literally in your hands. What do you do? The answer lies somewhere in the surreal haze of this dreamscape, waiting to unfold in colors and whispers you can’t yet comprehend.
