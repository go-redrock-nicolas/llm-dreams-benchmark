I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, dimly lit hall, surrounded by a sea of faces that blur together like watercolors on wet paper. The air is thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and the whispers of a thousand unspoken criticisms hang like a miasma over the crowd.

As I scan the faces, I see the people I've loved and sought approval from throughout my life. They're all here, their eyes fixed on me with a mixture of disapproval and disinterest. My parents, my teachers, my former partners – all of them wear the same expression, a mask of disappointment and expectation that I've never quite lived up to.

I try to speak, to explain myself, to justify my existence, but my voice is lost in the din of their murmured discontent. I strain to be heard, to make them understand, but the more I try, the more they seem to fade away, their faces blurring into the background like ghosts.

I'm desperate for their approval, for a nod, a smile, a kind word. I try to please them, to conform to their expectations, but no matter what I do, it's never enough. I'm a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit, a square peg trying to fit into a round hole.

As I wander through the hall, I'm confronted with echoes of my past, moments where I sought validation and was left wanting. I'm a child again, standing in front of my parents, seeking praise for a drawing that's not quite right. I'm a young adult, trying to impress my peers with a bravado that's just a cover for my insecurity.

The faces change, the settings shift, but the feeling remains the same – a deep-seated longing for acceptance that's always just out of reach. I'm a leaf blown about by the winds of other people's opinions, never quite finding my own sense of direction.

But as I dream on, something inside me begins to shift. I start to recognize the pattern, the futility of seeking validation from those who are determined to withhold it. I see that I'm trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, perpetually seeking external validation to fill a void within.

As this awareness grows, the hall begins to dissolve, the faces fading like mist in the morning sun. The whispers cease, and I'm left standing alone, bathed in a warm, golden light.

I take a deep breath, and as I exhale, I feel the weight of other people's expectations lifting, like a mantle being shed. I see that I've been living in a state of perpetual seeking, always trying to please others, never quite finding my own path.

In this moment, I'm free to forge my own way, to create my own sense of purpose. I take my first steps into the unknown, feeling the ground beneath my feet, solid and unshakeable. The dream begins to fade, but I know that I've been forever changed, that I'll carry this sense of liberation with me into the waking world.
