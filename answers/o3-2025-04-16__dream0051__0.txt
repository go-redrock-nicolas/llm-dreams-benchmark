I am dreaming. …find yourself floating in the cockpit, weightless yet steady, the night sky outside deep as velvet and sprinkled with a million pinpricks of silver. The hum of the engines—a comforting lullaby only moments ago—hiccups, stutters, then gutters out like a candle in a sudden wind. 

Every warning light on the panel erupts at once, a constellation of frantic reds and oranges. Alarms whoop in staccato bursts, a metallic heartbeat hammering at your ears. For a fraction of a second, panic rises like cold water—but then a remarkable stillness settles over you, as though the dream has slowed time to syrup.

You glance back through the cockpit door. In the cabin, faces glow in the blue-white mood lighting: an elderly woman cradling a snow-white cat in her lap, a teenage boy clutching a guitar plastered with stickers, a pair of twins whose identical expressions hover between wonder and worry. All of them are suspended in the same gravity-less moment, eyes searching for reassurance. They don’t speak, but their hope vibrates in the air like invisible violin strings.

With a breath that fills your lungs with the scent of ozone and distant thunderstorms, you grip the yoke—only now it has morphed into something organic, ribbed and pulsing, like the trunk of a living tree. The instruments flicker and rewrite themselves: altitude becomes “Potential,” airspeed becomes “Courage,” attitude indicator becomes “Heart.” Somewhere deep inside, the aircraft has transformed into an extension of your own dreaming body.

Outside, moonlit clouds peel away to reveal a trembling aurora. Ribbons of green and violet coil downward like cosmic serpents, brushing the wings with quiet sparks. When they touch the fuselage, the dead instruments twitch and glow. You sense the aurora is bargaining with the laws of physics on your behalf.

You close your eyes and reach inward. A new display blooms on the inside of your eyelids—a radiant map of possibilities: 

• Divert to the glowing mountain that rises from a sea of midnight, its peak shaped like a giant compass needle.  
• Ride the aurora river itself, allowing its electrostatic current to cradle the aircraft as gently as silk.  
• Surrender to freefall for exactly thirteen heartbeats, trusting that the dream will reveal another layer of sky beneath the one you know.

The passengers’ belief in you murmurs like a distant choir. You choose option two, sensing it hums with both wonder and feasibility. Hands pulsing with starlight, you guide the yoke-tree upward, nose angling into the curtains of color. The aurora wraps around the fuselage, crackling with citrine and amethyst sparks, and the aircraft thumps once—like a stone skipped across water—before gliding smoothly on a cushion of shimmering plasma. Alarms cease; the silence afterward feels cathedral-vast.

A laugh bubbles from your chest. Outside the windows, dolphins of pure electricity leap in slow arcs, carving trails of cobalt fire. The instruments, reborn, display whimsical readouts: “Altitude: Loosely Defined. Velocity: Swift Enough to Outrun Doubt.” Somewhere in the cabin, the twins are weightless, exchanging delighted cartwheels, their braids spinning like pinwheels.

On the horizon, a new dawn ignites—impossibly fast—painting the sky with molten tangerine and rose. You angle toward it, feeling the auroral river thinning but confident now that ordinary physics will return, tamed and obedient. The engines cough, catch, and finally purr again, re-knit by dream logic and polarized magic.

As the first light spills over the cockpit windows, you glance once more at your passengers. The elderly woman strokes her cat, its eyes twin lanterns of emerald peace. The guitarist strums a chord that sounds exactly like the moment a storm breaks over summer fields. Every soul on board glows with sunrise, tethered to you by the pulsing cord of shared relief.

The dream dilutes, colors streaming outward like watercolor on wet paper. Yet just before waking, you glimpse your reflection in the cockpit glass: eyes bright with aurora flame, a small smile carved by impossible survival. The dream whispers a final line in your ear—

“You are the sky’s own heartbeat; remember the way it felt to save a hundred worlds while drifting through a single night.”

And then morning slips into your room like a friendly ghost, leaving the scent of ozone and violet still tangled in your hair, and the echo of distant applause—the passengers, perhaps—pulsing softly in your chest.
