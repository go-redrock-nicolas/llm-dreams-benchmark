I am dreaming. I've created something deeply meaningful that requires exposing my innermost vulnerabilities. As critics begin their merciless analysis, I feel myself frozen in place, watching as they circle my creation—a towering sculpture made of translucent glass panels etched with fragments of my most private memories.

The gallery space stretches impossibly far in all directions, the ceiling vaulting so high it disappears into shadow. Each footfall of the approaching critics echoes like thunder. Their faces shift and blur—sometimes bearing the features of childhood teachers, sometimes strangers, sometimes wearing the faces of those I've loved most deeply.

My sculpture catches the light differently with each passing moment. Sometimes it reveals the etching of my first heartbreak, sometimes the moment I realized my own mortality while standing at my grandfather's bedside, sometimes the silent tears I shed alone when no one was watching.

The critics' voices begin as whispers that somehow penetrate every corner of the vast space. Their words materialize as visible smoke, curling around my creation, sometimes caressing it, sometimes constricting it like vines. I want to defend my work, explain its meaning, but my voice has abandoned me.

Then something unexpected happens—as one particularly harsh criticism strikes the glass, instead of shattering, the sculpture begins to sing. A resonant, multitoned hum emanates from within, growing louder, drowning out the critics. The glass begins to glow from within, casting rainbow patterns across the floor, walls, and the now-silent observers.

I realize with a surging clarity that vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the very source of the light now filling the room. The critics' faces transform into expressions of wonder as they too begin to see themselves reflected in the gleaming surfaces of my creation.
