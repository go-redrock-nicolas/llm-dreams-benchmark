I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like liquid glass, and the sky pulses in hues of indigo and molten gold, as though the universe itself is breathing. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all—*they are made of tangled thread*, their branches unraveling into ribbons that flutter in a wind you cannot feel. Each step you take sends ripples through the ground, which shifts beneath your feet: one moment mossy velvet, the next slick obsidian, then a carpet of luminous violets that hum when crushed.  

You realize you are being chased, though by what, you cannot say. Shadows peel themselves from the trunks and slither after you, shapeless yet purposeful, like ink spilled across water. Your heart should be racing, but instead, it *sings*. A strange calm unfurls in your chest, as if your ribs have become the ribs of a violin, resonating with the chaos around you. You stop running. Turn. The shadows halt, too, pooling into a mirror that reflects not your face, but a storm—a tempest of flickering memories and half-formed fears, all swirling in your throat. You open your mouth to scream, but out spills a flock of sapphire moths, their wings spelling *release* in a language of dust.  

The forest dissolves. Now you float in a desert where the sand is alive, coiling into serpents that spell words in a forgotten tongue. Heat rises, but it does not burn—it *shapes*. Each grain etches symbols onto your skin, runes that glow then fade, like lessons your body remembers but your mind does not. A cactus blooms beside you, its petals peeling back to reveal a beating heart. You press your palm to it and feel every rhythm you’ve ever ignored: the pulse of your childhood laughter, the arrhythmia of heartbreak, the slow drum of grief. And yet, there is no pain. Only *understanding*.  

A river appears, but it flows *upward*, dragging stones and whispers into the sky. You wade in, and the water is not wet—it’s a swarm of fireflies, their light seeping into your lungs. You drown, but it feels like flying. Memories of stress, once jagged and sharp, soften here. The fireflies carry them away, transforming them into constellations that dot the undersides of your eyelids. You think of deadlines, arguments, sleepless nights… and they rise from your lips as bubbles, iridescent and weightless, popping into melodies that the wind steals.  

On the far bank, a city materializes, its towers woven from mirrors and smoke. You enter, and every surface reflects not your image, but *versions* of you: a child clutching a cracked teacup, a stranger screaming into a void, an elder planting seeds in ash. You touch one mirror, and the figures step out, their hands brushing yours. The child giggles, the stranger weeps, the elder smiles. Together, they form a chorus that hums in your bones: *You are not one thing. You are not broken. You are becoming.*  

The dream fractures. You fall into a cavern where the walls are made of teeth, gnashing in silent fury. But you are unafraid. You pluck a single tooth from the wall, and it melts into a key. The floor drops away, revealing a garden of clocks, their gears blooming into roses. You pick one—a timepiece with no hands—and it ticks in reverse, rewinding the ache in your joints, the weight in your thoughts, the knots in your breath.  

When you wake, the dream clings to you like perfume. The stress is still there, yes—but now it wears a different face. No longer a monster, but a teacher. A sculptor. A wild river you’ve learned to swim. And somewhere, deep in your marrow, a new truth glows: *The thing that changes you is also the thing that sets you free.*
