I am dreaming. The air is thick with the acrid scent of burning metal and ozone, a hazy orange glow pulsing on the horizon like a dying star. The evacuation sirens wail in dissonant harmonies, their usual orderly patterns shattered into chaotic, overlapping shrieks. The city—once a gleaming monument to human ingenuity—now shudders under the weight of some unseen force, its skyscrapers swaying like reeds in a hurricane.  

I stand at the heart of the command center, but the screens before me flicker with static, maps and schematics melting into indecipherable glyphs. The protocols—meticulously crafted over decades—now spit out solutions that only accelerate the disaster. Every evacuation route we open collapses into gridlock. Every safe zone we designate is swallowed by some new, unfathomable anomaly. The ground itself seems to shift, streets rearranging like a living labyrinth.  

A voice crackles over the comms, panicked: *"The bridges are folding. The tunnels are breathing. We can't trust the exits anymore."*  

I close my eyes, feeling the dream-logic take hold. The rules here are different. The crisis isn’t just spreading—it’s *learning*, adapting to our responses, feeding on our order. So I do the one thing the protocols never accounted for.  

I tell them to stop running.  

A hush falls over the command center. The sirens stutter. Outside, the fleeing crowds slow, hesitating as the ground beneath them steadies—just for a moment. The city holds its breath.  

Then, from the twisting sky, a sound like a thousand whispers coalescing into a single word: *"Listen."*  

And in the dream, I realize—we weren’t meant to escape. We were meant to understand.  

The world unravels. The crisis isn’t a disaster.  

It’s a question.  

And the dream shifts again—
