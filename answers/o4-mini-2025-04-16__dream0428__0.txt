I am dreaming. I drift through a world woven of light and vapor, each inhale carrying the soft scent of night-blooming florals. At first, everything seems perfect: the sky ripples with pastel auroras, birdsong hums like a tuning fork in my chest, and every step I take leaves trails of glowing petals on the emerald grass. Joy thrums through me—yet beneath it, a tiny voice of worry whispers, “Anything this lovely can’t last.” My heart hitches, as though braced for a storm that never quite arrives.  

But the dream guides me onward, nudging that anxious pulse toward wonder. A pair of golden sparrows appears, weaving loops in the sky just above my head. Their wings brush my cheeks like summer breezes, and in their chirps I hear laughter—gentle insistence that there is no price to pay for beauty. I lift my gaze: the aurora shifts, painting a river of light that spills down to form a silken waterfall. Its spray tastes of sweet dew, washing away my dread with each glimmering droplet.  

Drawn to the cascade, I step into its prism of shifting colors. Water threads itself through my fingers, and I sense every droplet humming with reassurance. Where once I expected the walls to cave in, I now feel safe, held in a lullaby spun by the very air around me. The anxious knot within my chest melts, replaced by curiosity and awe.  

Beyond the waterfall lies a meadow of lantern-flowers: enormous blooms perched on stalks of spun glass, each one a softly pulsing beacon. Touching a lantern-flower, I feel its warmth radiate through my palm, as though the earth itself is pressing a gentle hand to my shoulder: “Rest here. You belong.” In that hush, worry unravels further. I allow myself to float—weightless—in a pool of silver light beneath a sky that now glows not with warning, but with promise.  

Time drips by like honey. I find a seated figure carved of crystal, eyes closed in perpetual contentment. It offers me a rosy chalice brimming with starlight. Bringing it to my lips, I taste pure kindness, an elixir that seeps into every fiber of my being. My anxious mind, expecting collapse, instead finds renewal: understanding that joy needn’t be fragile.  

Clutching the chalice, I rise and walk back toward the edge of the meadow. Here, the flowers bow in silent celebration of my newfound ease. With each step, their lamps glow brighter—proof that this peace grows stronger when shared with the world. I wake from the dream carrying its warmth like a secret talisman, reminding myself that whenever worry creeps in, I can breathe myself back into this realm of light and let its gentle wonders fill the spaces fear once occupied.
