I am dreaming. You peak around a corner into the dimly lit lab, grasping a scrap of paper in your hand. Scribbled in black ink is your next clue - "S37, aisle 3." The hallway feels impossibly long, lined with flickering fluorescent lights that hum softly. The faint smell of antiseptic stings your nose as you creep forward, clutching the crumpled paper like a lifeline. Your heart hammers in your chest, the rhythm growing louder with each step. 

You pass by a row of numbered doors, each marked with glowing red numbers. S31...S32...there it is. S37. The door looms before you, slightly ajar, casting a shadow across the cold tile floor. Slowly, you push it open, wincing as it creaks on its hinges. The room is empty except for a single metal table in the center, illuminated by a harsh overhead light. On the table sits a small, unmarked box. 

You edge closer, your breath fogging in the chill air. The box is cold to the touch, its smooth surface reflecting the harsh glare of the bulb above. With trembling hands, you lift the lid. Inside lies a single photograph, edges frayed and worn. It's a picture of you, smiling, standing in front of a brightly colored carnival booth. Your eyes widen in recognition - this was real. This moment was yours. 

But as you turn the photo over, a note scrawled on the back sends icy chills down your spine: "Memory Implant Experiment 147 - Subject 37." Your knees buckle, and you sink to the floor, clutching the photograph to your chest. Your mind whirls with questions - which memories were yours? Which were planted? Was any of it real? 

The fluorescent lights above you flicker and buzz, casting eerie shadows that dance along the walls. The air grows heavier, pressing down on you like a weight. You feel as though you're being watched, your every move scrutinized. You glance at the door, half expecting someone to burst in and demand the photograph back. But the hallway remains silent, the only sound the rhythmic thud of your pulse in your ears. 

A low hum fills the air, growing louder and more insistent. It seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, vibrating through the very walls. You grip the photograph tighter, desperate for answers. The hum reaches a crescendo, drowning out all other sound, until suddenly - silence. 

You open your eyes. 

The room is gone. You're standing in the middle of a vast, empty field, the grass beneath your feet soft and damp with morning dew. The air is crisp, the faintest hint of sunlight peeking over the horizon. You look down at your hands - the photograph is gone. In its place is a small, silver key. 

You turn in a slow circle, your senses heightened. The key feels significant, important, though you don't know why. You slip it into your pocket and begin to walk towards the rising sun, the faintest glimmer of hope sparking in your chest. Perhaps this key will unlock more than just doors. Perhaps it will unlock the truth. 

As you walk, the grass beneath your feet grows taller, brushing against your legs in a gentle caress. You feel a sense of calm wash over you, a respite from the chaos of the lab. The sun climbs higher in the sky, warming your face and casting long shadows across the field. 

And then, in the distance, you see it - a small, wooden door standing alone in the middle of the field. The key in your pocket grows warm, almost as though it's urging you forward. You approach the door cautiously, running your fingers over its rough surface. It looks ancient, weathered by time and the elements. 

You insert the key into the lock, turning it slowly. The mechanism clicks, and the door swings open with surprising ease. A blast of cold air hits you, carrying with it the faint scent of pine and something else - something metallic. You step through the doorway, your heart racing. 

You find yourself in another lab, but this one is different. It's brightly lit, with rows of glowing computer screens and humming machinery. A figure sits at one of the desks, their back to you. They turn slowly, their face shrouded in shadow. 

"Welcome back," they say, their voice low and smooth. "We've been waiting for you." 

You take a step forward, your voice steady despite the storm of emotions swirling inside you. "Who are you?" you demand. "What is this place?" 

The figure smiles, a chilling, knowing smile. "You know who I am," they reply. "Or rather, who I was. I'm you. Or at least, I was." 

Your mind spins, trying to process the impossibility of it all. You open your mouth to speak, but the figure cuts you off. 

"Don't bother asking questions," they say. "You won't find the answers here. Not yet." 

The figure gestures to a nearby table, where a single, glowing orb sits. It pulses with a soft, eerie light, almost like a heartbeat. "Take it," they say. "It's yours. It always has been." 

You reach out, your hand trembling. The orb is warm to the touch, its light intensifying as you lift it off the table. You feel a jolt of energy surge through you, a clarity you haven't felt in a long time. 

"The answers are inside you," the figure says, their voice fading as the room begins to spin. "Remember who you are. Remember what you've lost." 

The world fades to black, leaving you alone in the darkness. You clutch the orb tightly, its glow the only thing keeping you anchored. You know now what you must do. You must find the truth, no matter the cost. 

You take a deep breath, your mind racing with possibilities. You are ready. You are whole. You are you. 

You wake up.
