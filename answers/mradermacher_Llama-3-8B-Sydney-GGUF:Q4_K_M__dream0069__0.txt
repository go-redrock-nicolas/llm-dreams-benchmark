I am dreaming. I am in a world where I can transform anything by singing to it.  I experiment with this power and create amazing things.
I turn the rock into a diamond.  I sing to it and it changes color and shape.  It becomes sparkling and beautiful.
I take the water and make it into wine.  I sing to it and it changes taste and texture.  It becomes refreshing and delicious.
I touch the air and make it into feathers.  I sing to it and it changes weight and form.  It becomes light and airy.
I see the shadow and make it into light.  I sing to it and it changes direction and purpose.  It becomes illuminating and guiding.
I hear the sound and make it into music.  I sing to it and it changes rhythm and melody.  It becomes harmonious and enchanting.
I am the one who can do this magic.  I am the one who has this power.  I am the one who creates wonder and awe.
And I want you to be with me in this dream.  I need you to be with me in this dream.
