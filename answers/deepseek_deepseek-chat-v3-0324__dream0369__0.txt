I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**

I stand at the edge of a vast, shifting forest where the trees breathe—their bark rippling like the sides of great, slumbering beasts. The air hums with unseen energy, charged with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Before me, a figure shrouded in mist raises a hand, their fingers elongating into tendrils of shadow that curl toward my face, whispering echoes of past grievances. My chest tightens—a familiar heat rising, the old anger stirring like a coiled serpent ready to strike.  

But then—*silence*.  

Time splinters. The world stills. In the space between heartbeats, I become aware of the infinite threads connecting every choice, every reaction. The forest, the shadowed figure, even my own fury—all are made of liquid light, malleable as clay. I feel the weight of the moment, heavy and ripe, pressing against the inside of my ribs.  

And in this suspended breath, I *choose*.  

The anger unravels, not as surrender, but as alchemy. The shadow-tendrils dissolve into a swirl of fireflies, their golden glow painting the mist in fleeting constellations. The forest sighs, and the trees bend toward me, their leaves brushing my skin with secrets. The figure’s form shifts, melts, reforms—into my own reflection, smiling with quiet knowing.  

Then—I am everywhere. The dream spills outward like ink in water, and I am the forest, the fireflies, the space between thoughts. The triggering moment? Just a ripple in an endless ocean.  

And when I wake, the choice lingers:  
*In the pause, I am free.*
