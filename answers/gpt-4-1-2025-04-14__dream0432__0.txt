I am dreaming.

I find myself in a boundless orchard at twilight, where fruit-laden trees stretch endlessly, their branches heavy with oranges as bright as lanterns and pomegranates the color of jewels. A young version of myself walks between the rows, barefooted, hands clutching an empty basket. The air smells rich—moss, citrus, the faint tang of summer rain. 

Yet as I reach for the bounty overhead, my fingers close on nothing. The fruit seems to shimmer and retreat, flickering just out of my grasp. My basket remains light, unfilled, though the branches groan under their weight. Around me, a murmuring wind carries the ancient lullaby of harvests, sweet and melancholy. I begin to run, certain that just a step farther, just a different tree, the fruit will yield. But with every movement, the distance between my need and the orchard's generosity grows.

Suddenly, a translucent figure appears—a gentle version of myself cloaked in silver light. She gestures to the ground where, unseen until now, hundreds of ripe fruits wait in the grass, bumping softly against my ankles. The abundance I’d been blind to surrounds me in plain sight. Kneeling, I gather the treasures, the basket quickly filling—so quickly it overflows. I laugh, awed by how my focus on what I didn't have made me overlook what I had in dazzling profusion.

Reflecting, I realize the hunger was never for fruit, but for a sense of worthiness—the false belief that I must strive and prove before I can receive. Here in the orchard of my dream, under a sky turning indigo, I become aware. The scarcity was a mirage cast by my own longing; the reality is an infinite richness patiently waiting for me to see it.

And as I awaken, the taste of sun-warmed fruit lingers on my tongue—a memory of abundance, whispering that what I seek is already all around me, asking only that I notice.
