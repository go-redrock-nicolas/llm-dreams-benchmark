I am dreaming. You slip deeper into the dream. The chamber around you stretches and warps, its stone walls breathing in low, rhythmic pulses. Flickering torchlight dances across towering columns carved with serpentine runes that seem to coil and uncoil in time with your heartbeat. In the center of the room, a great obsidian desk holds the ancient text: its pages are woven from a living substance, like silken spider-web tangled with shifting starlight. As your fingers brush the glyphs, they glow—each symbol dissolving into a tiny galaxy of luminous motes that drift upward, only to be sucked back into the next character you reach for.

Behind you, a bank of gleaming holo-screens floats in the air, arranged in a semi-circle. Data pours across them in torrents: cascading waterfalls of numbers, color-coded graphs that morph into dancing fractals, and lines of alien script that pulse with coded intent. You try to focus on the center screen where the most volatile readings flash in electric blue, but as soon as you lock your gaze, the text on your desk shimmers, and your mind lurches between the two tasks like a fugitive between parallel worlds.

Your thoughts crackle in overloaded synapses. Every time you attempt to parse an ancient word—“Lumora,” “Khethryl,” “Omdaar”—it reverberates in your skull, unlocking a hidden subroutine on a screen behind you. A map of constellations appears, then dissolves into an anatomical projection of a creature you’ve never seen, its sinewy organs labeled in the same glyphs you’re racing to translate. Your pulse spikes; sweat beads at your temples. The once-orderly stream of data now resembles a tempest, each screen howling in a different digital tongue. You feel as though you’re standing at the eye of a tornado, the calm center of your consciousness threatened by roiling chaos all around.

Yet even as your mind teeters on the brink, a thread of intuition guides you. You trace a sequence of three symbols with your index finger—“O–M–E”—and instantly the screens hush, their frantic flicker slowing to a gentle cadence. The text before you parts like a curtain, revealing a hidden line written in liquid silver: “At the pulse of dawn, the cosmos will yield its secret.” In that suspended moment, sound drains away; you exist only in the hush between two heartbeats, poised between revelation and collapse, waiting for the final word to materialize.
