I am dreaming. The air is heavy with the scent of petrichor and the faintest whisper of ozone.  Around me, impossible geometries swirl—prisms of light refract through inverted spires that pierce leaden skies, each tower a fractal labyrinth of staircases that spiral inward rather than upward. 

A figure approaches, their form flickering between solid and translucent. Their voice echoes as if underwater: "The closer you come to the edge, the more clearly you see the center." 

Suddenly, I'm standing in a sun-dappled forest where trees have bark like obsidian, their leaves glowing emerald under a double sunset. A river flows backwards, its surface unrippled except for the occasional disturbance caused by silver fish swimming upwards. 

I reach for one of the fish, and my fingers pass through its shimmering body. The figure's laughter resonates in my skull. "Touch only leads to loss," they say. "But loss... that's where the connections begin." 

The forest dissolves into a library, endless shelves of books with covers that shift when unobserved. Some titles flicker in languages long dead, others in symbols only I can decipher. A single sentence flashes before me: *Survival is the art of rearranging shadows.* 

I trace the letters, and the words rearrange: *Shadows are what keep the stars from burning out.* 

The ground falls away. I'm floating in a nebula of scattered memories—birthdays I never had, goodbyes I should have said, paths not taken glowing like dying stars. Hands made of stardust pull me toward a vortex at the core, where a question hovers: **What are you willing to forget to remember how to live?**
