I am dreaming. # The Infinite Library of Forgotten Hours

My consciousness drifts through a shimmering mist that parts to reveal an impossibly vast library extending in all directions—above, below, and beyond any conceivable horizon. The bookshelves reach so high they seem to bend with the curvature of reality itself, their rich mahogany frames glowing with an inner light that pulses like a heartbeat.

I notice I've been fixating on only the books with crimson bindings, my attention unconsciously filtering the countless other colors surrounding me. As I realize this, my perception expands dramatically—suddenly I'm aware of tomes bound in midnight blue that seem to contain actual stars, volumes wrapped in living emerald moss, and ancient scrolls suspended in bubbles of amber light.

The air tastes of cinnamon and something metallic, like the moment before lightning strikes. Each breath fills my lungs with knowledge that tingles through my bloodstream. I look down at my hands and discover they're translucent, glowing with script in a language I somehow understand despite never having seen it before.

A librarian approaches—or perhaps materializes—beside me. Her face shifts between that of an elderly woman with eyes like galaxies and a young child whose smile contains impossible geometries. Her voice resonates not in my ears but directly within my mind.

"You've been reading only the stories you expected to find," she says, gesturing toward infinite shelves. "What about the ones hiding between moments of your attention?"

I follow her pointing finger and suddenly perceive thousands of whisper-thin volumes wedged between the more substantial books—texts written on pages made from pressed butterfly wings, dreams, and forgotten conversations.

The floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing that we stand atop countless other library floors, each one containing different versions of myself reading different books, making different choices. Looking up, I see the same pattern repeating endlessly above.

The librarian hands me a book bound in what feels like warm skin. Opening it, I discover it's writing itself as I read, the words describing exactly this moment, this dream, this realization—and extending beyond into possibilities I haven't yet imagined...
