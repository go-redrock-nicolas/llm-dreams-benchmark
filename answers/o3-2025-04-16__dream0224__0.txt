I am dreaming.

At the center of an endlessly unfolding silver plain, I open my eyes and see…everywhere. The horizon is not a line but a shimmering circle of mirrors, each pane tilting slightly, catching the glow of an unseen sun. In every mirror, I glimpse a different me: one stepping forward, another pausing, another turning back. The air vibrates with the faint hum of infinite possibility, a chorus so layered it seems silent until I focus—then the individual notes blossom like piano strings struck in slow motion.

With a thought, I lift my hand. It is as if lightning forks from my fingertips: translucent ribbons of timeline peel away, arcing into the distance. One ribbon carries a version of me who walks left toward a grove of cyan-leaved trees; another tugs right, striding toward a city of glass spires; still another simply kneels to press a palm against the rippling silver ground. I am somehow inside and outside each path, witness and participant at once.

First I follow the leftward thread:

The grove greets me with leaves that rustle like whispered secrets. Each leaf falls upward, drifting into the sky to become new constellations. As I step among the trunks, the bark records my passage—ridges rearrange into delicate bas-relief memories: me at six, laughing in summer rain; me at sixteen, startled by first love; me just moments ago, waking in this dream. Time here is a sculptor working in living wood. I inhale the scent of mint and distant thunderstorms, and every inhalation writes another future in the canopy. When I exhale, visions burst overhead like auroras—futures where I become a cartographer of dreams, a keeper of celestial libraries, a silent wanderer who leaves no footprints.

A gentle tug pulls me sideways into the next ribbon:

Now I stride toward the glass city. Towers coil like conch shells, their transparent surfaces pulsing with rivers of color—decisions made, regrets unmade, hopes still fermenting. Elevators of pure light carry citizens upward, each lift tuned to the frequency of a choice: an apology offered, a risk embraced, a truth spoken too late. I step into one such lift and rise past floors labeled not by numbers but by verbs: Begin, Mend, Leap, Sing. On the floor called Forgive, I see a hall lined with doors, each door a translucent film showing two scenes overlapped: the hurt as it happened, and the healing that could be. I brush a door with my palm and feel years of tension unspool like ribbon in warm water. My chest grows lighter, my reflection clearer.

Another tug, a new fork:

I return to the mirror plain, but this time I kneel. The moment my knee touches the surface, the silver liquefies, bending into a pool that reflects not faces but pivot points—those flickering instants when the future trembles before deciding what shape to take. I watch my life like a deck of cards shuffled by an invisible hand: pick the top card, and I study marine biology; cut deeper, and I write symphonies; split the deck again, and I travel the world trading pocket-sized poems for strangers’ stories. Each possibility gleams like a droplet on a spider’s web at dawn. I realize the web is not separate from me—I am both weaver and dew.

From the corner of my eye another ribbon blooms:

It is dimmer, edged in dusk. On this path I refuse every choice, paralyzed by the fear of fracturing reality further. The world responds by slowing, colors draining into grayscale. Yet even here, stillness births consequence—a reminder that indecision is itself a decision. I watch that version of me sit down, hug knees to chest, and the timeline narrows to a single hair-thin wire. A sympathetic ache pulses in my heart. I lift a hand in silent salute to that fragile self before drifting free.

Then a burst of multicolored wind sweeps across all ribbons at once. The gust smells of sun-warmed oranges and library dust. It carries a message without words: every branch is rooted in the same trunk, every ending curls back to a beginning, and no path—chosen or unchosen—is truly lost. Even the thinnest possibility leaves an imprint on the universal canvas, a faint but indelible brushstroke.

I feel curiosity bloom like wildflowers behind my sternum. Instead of tracking a single ribbon, I allow myself to dissolve into the nexus where they intersect. My senses multiply: I hear rain on ten thousand roofs, taste the first bite of bread in ten thousand kitchens, feel the heat of desert suns and the chill of mountaintop dawns all at once. It is overwhelming—and yet it is home. Here, identity is not a prison of one storyline but a constellation of shining nodes, each point a chapter, the whole flashing in perfect, chaotic harmony.

Somewhere far away, maybe on my pillow in the waking world, I sense the rustle of daylight approaching. The timelines vibrate, preparing to compress back into a single thread as consciousness climbs toward morning. Before they do, I gather a final souvenir: a small origami crane folded from prismatic light. On its wings is inscribed a single phrase, flickering through a thousand alphabets yet instantly understood:

Choose—then keep listening.

I press the crane to my heart. The dream tilts, mirrors fade, and the silver plain contracts into a pinprick star that slides behind my eyelids. I am falling upward, carrying with me the echo of infinite branches and the delicate hush of possibility.

I awaken, the word Choose still glowing like dawn on the inside of my skull, and I know that every step today will leave twin footprints: one in the world I see, and one in the unseen garden of what-might-be.
