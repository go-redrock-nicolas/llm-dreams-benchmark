I am dreaming. I discover an ancient riddle carved into stone that no one has solved for millennia. As I study the symbols and cryptic clues, I feel a strange warmth emanating from the weathered rock beneath my fingertips. The stone itself seems to pulse with forgotten knowledge, its surface etched with spiraling glyphs that shimmer between states of being—sometimes appearing as text in languages I shouldn't understand, yet somehow do.

The air around me grows thick with possibility as dust motes dance in shafts of amber light filtering through unseen windows. I realize I'm standing in what must be a temple, its vast ceiling disappearing into shadows where occasionally I glimpse movement—perhaps birds, perhaps something else entirely.

The riddle speaks of "the meeting place of three moons where time folds back upon itself" and "the song that builds mountains from whispers." As I contemplate these impossibilities, the floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing an ocean of stars beneath my feet, each one connected by threads of luminous blue energy.

My consciousness expands outward, and I suddenly perceive that the riddle isn't merely words on stone but a key—a pattern that exists simultaneously in my mind and in the fabric of reality itself. The solution isn't something to be spoken but to be realized, a shift in perception that makes me both observer and observed.

With a sensation like remembering something I've always known, the answer blooms within me. The temple walls dissolve into cascades of symbols that rearrange themselves around me, and I understand that I am both the one who discovers the riddle and the one who carved it, separated only by the illusion of linear time.
