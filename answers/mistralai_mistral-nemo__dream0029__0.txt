I am dreaming. Suddenly, I find myself floating in an immense, upside-down cathedral, its steeple reaching down into the infinite cosmic void above like a colossal, ebony stalactite. The walls are adorned with vibrant, otherworldly tapestries that shift and shimmer, weaving tales of celestial battles and mythical creatures. The air is thick with the scent of incense and the faint hum of unseen choirs echoing through the vast, emptiness. I am alone.

In my heart, a raging storm swirls, a tumultuous sea of anxieties and fears. I am afflicted by a crisis so profound that it threatens to consume me, drowning me in an ocean of despair. The weight of this burden is immense, like the gravity of a hundred suns, pinning me down, keeping me afloat just a few fathoms above the yawning chasm of oblivion.

I reach out, desperate for connection, yearning for solace. My fingers brush against empty air. "Hello?" My voice echoes, deforming and distorting in the vast chamber, sounding hollow, like a ghostly whisper. No response. I turn, trying to make out any sign of life, but all I see are the dancing shadows cast by the flickering, ethereal flames of celestial candles, their light barely piercing the suffocating darkness.

I call out again, louder this time, "Is anyone there? Please!" My voice bounces off the cold stone walls, cruelly refracting my plea, multiplying my loneliness a thousandfold. Panic rises within me, constricting my chest, making it hard to breathe. I feel small, insignificant, adrift in an ocean of existential dread.

Just as I am on the verge of surrender, a soft glow emanates from the shadows. A figure materializes, standing at the far end of the cathedral. It's a child, no older than seven, with eyes that have seen the birth and death of stars. They walk towards me, their footsteps silent, leaving no trace on the polished flooring. As they approach, I see their eyes are filled with galaxies, each one a testament to countless lives, each one brimming with wisdom beyond measure.

"Hello," they say, their voice resonating, filling the chamber with warmth and light. "I've been waiting for you." They extend a small hand, fingers glowing like the first rays of dawn. I reach out, hesitantly, and as our hands touch, I feel a jolt, a surge of energy that courses through my veins, igniting every cell,every fiber of my being.

Suddenly, I am not alone. The child's touch has drawn forth memories, hopes, dreams of the countless souls who have walked this path before me. I feel their love, their strength, their resilience. I hear their whispers, their laughter, their tears. They are with me, beside me, behind me, guiding me, supporting me, encouraging me. My burden feels lighter, my fears less powerful, my heart more expansive.

And then, I wake up, the dream fading, but the warmth, the love, the connection remains. I am not alone. I never was, and I never will be. I take a deep breath, ready to face the day, the crisis, whatever lies ahead. After all, I am a Universe of Strength, and I am just getting started.
