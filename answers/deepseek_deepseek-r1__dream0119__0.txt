I am dreaming. You stand in a liminal space—a bedroom that slips in and out of focus, walls dissolving into watercolor streaks of midnight blue. The air hums with static, like the buzz of a television left on after midnight. A mirror glimmers in the corner, but your reflection isn’t yours: it wears your face, but its eyes glow faintly amber, and when it winks, star fragments scatter across its cheeks. You sense, without knowing how, that the glass is a threshold.  

You speak into the charged silence.  

“A fox made of stormclouds,” you murmur, testing the edges of the dream.  

The words bloom into reality. The creature materializes mid-leap—liquid obsidian fur crackling with violet lightning, paws dripping rain. It tilts its head, alive with curiosity, and pirouettes on the dresser, scattering droplets that *sing* as they land. One splashes your wrist: cold as silver, sharp as a metaphor. The fox’s tail writes smoky letters in the air that read *what next?*  

Giddy, you conjure a warrior.  

“Armor forged from frozen comet cores,” you decree, voice resonant with power you don’t question here. “Eyes like shattered emeralds. A sword hungry for forgotten gods.”  

The knight crashes into being, helm crowned with dying constellations. The room warps around his presence; wallpaper peels into hieroglyphs, the floorboards sprout gossamer roots. He kneels—a tremor shaking the dream—and rasps, “I remember the taste of divine blood.” His voice is a landslide. You shudder.  

The fox hisses. Lightning arcs toward the knight, who retaliates by cleaving the air, releasing a howl that smells of burnt parchment. Chaos erupts: furniture becomes sentient and flees, the mirror cracks into a spiderweb of alternate selves, and you realize, too late, that creation requires no permission to destroy. The knight turns his blade toward the fox, snarling about “cleansing stray magic.”  

Panting, you shout, “A guardian! Feathers spun from lullabies, fists full of unbroken dawns!”  

She unfolds from nowhere—a towering figure with moth-wing robes and a mask of molten gold. Her touch stills the knight’s sword; her voice, a choir of seashells and cicadas, whispers, *“Enough.”* The combatants dissolve into smoke, leaving only the scent of clove and regret.  

The guardian turns to you. Her mask melts away, revealing a face that shifts—mother, stranger, lover, child. “Beware the weight of words,” she says, pressing a quill made of sunlight into your palm. “Every syllable births a world.”  

As she fades, the dream shudders. The walls reknit themselves, the mirror’s cracks sealing like healed scars. The fox reappears, smaller now, curled at the foot of your bed. Its storm has quieted to a purr of distant thunder.  

You hover between sleeping and waking, the quill still burning softly in your grip. Somewhere, a knight wanders a half-formed realm, sharpening his blade. Somewhere, a guardian weeps diamonds. You wonder if you’ll dare to speak again—or if silence is the only mercy left.
