I am dreaming. I am driving along a winding road, threading the needle through lush green hills and valleys. The sun is warm, casting long shadows across the pavement, creating a patchwork of light and dark. Gregg's voice rings in my head, “Focus,” he says, and I feel an electric clarity in my hands on the wheel, as if each movement is deliberate, precise. 

The road begins to steepen, winding down into a valley where traffic thickens, slowing ahead. My foot presses the brake, expecting resistance, but there is none. The pedal sinks to the floor as if disconnected. A flash of panic courses through me, but Gregg's training kicks in. “Shift down,” his voice commands. I slam the gearstick into a lower gear, engine roaring as it struggles to slow us. 

Ahead, cars are now creeping to a stop, a wall of steel and glass growing closer. I twist the wheel gently, trying to find any gap as the world narrows into this moment. “Don't lock up,” I hear him say, and my shoulders loosen even as adrenaline floods me. I feather the clutch, coaxing every ounce of deceleration from the engine. 

A narrow alley appears to my right, an escape route no wider than my car. “Go!” Gregg's voice roars in my mind, and I snap the wheel hard, threading into the space just as a horn blares. My tires squeal against the pavement, but I am through, clear, and my heart still pounds in my chest. 

I pull over, shaking, my breath coming in shallow bursts. The car idles quietly, and I am alive, hyper-present in this dream-world where danger has sharpened every sense. Gregg’s voice, though distant now, is etched in my mind: “Breathe, steady.” I take his advice, and my pulse slows, my hands unclenching.
