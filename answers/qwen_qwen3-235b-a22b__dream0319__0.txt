I am dreaming. 

Night envelops me like velvet, sticky and deep, as though the stars themselves are leaning in to whisper. I find myself standing on the rim of a vast, uncharted valley wrapped in mist — not the kind seen in waking life, but a cerulean fog flecked with soft specks of silver light that glimmer like dream-dust caught in moon-glow. It ripples across the land like a living thing, drifting lazily over the jagged spires of obsidian towers rising from cracked earth. These surreal formations stretch in all directions, like broken teeth from the maw of the planet itself.

The air tastes strange — metallic and sweet, like dissolving coins and candied violets. It tingles on the tongue, each breath sharpening the hallucinatory clarity of the dream world. Somewhere below a low rumble shifts the earth, and I feel it vibrate in my bones, a reminder that this place is alive, ancient, aware. 

A woman, cloaked in flowing robes stitched with threads of bioluminescent coral, approaches me. Her eyes pulse softly like dying embers, and when she speaks, it is without moving her lips — her words drift into my mind like recorded echoes pulled from the pages of forgotten books.

*"They speak of treasures too strange for starlight and of lost voices buried beneath sentient sands,"* she murmurs, offering a delicate silver sphere the size of an apple. It pulses in rhythm with the earth’s heartbeat — Erratic one moment, steady the next. *"This land doth not give. It takes. But if you dare walk its corridors of twilight, it may grant you madness or revelation."*

Behind her, silhouettes shimmer and twist into view — shadowed figures with tinted faces and mismatched limbs — each clad in scavenged armor and psychotropic fabrics woven from molten echoes. They are not human, nor are they entirely beast — and yet they exude a familiarity that unsettles me to the roots of my being. They beckon me toward a path carved into the black stone, lined with eyes that blink but never look. With each step forward, reality begins to pucker and blur, as though time itself is folding inward.

A pair of symmetrical rivers — one crimson, one ivory — cuts through the landscape below. The waters do not merge, but rather spiral together in a hypnotic dance, like twin serpents locked in perpetual orbit. Above, the sky becomes a patchwork of impossible constellations: figures frozen in eternal motion, stars shaped like weeping angels and broken clocks pouring endless hours into the dark. 

As the tremor returns, the obsidian spires shudder and expand, cracking open like enormous geodes. From within pour trails of liquid sound — not melodies, but emotions so raw they make me stagger: grief suspended in diamonds, rage unspooling as ribbons, laughter coiled like violets. The ground beneath my feet is no longer solid; it’s made of memories, memories plucked from minds long gone. Each step I take causes faint voices to wail out in dissonant poetry, narrating tragedies unrecorded by history.

The expedition begins not with movement, but with knowing: that what lies ahead is a labyrinth of dreams nested within dreams. The deeper I travel, the more the world remakes itself — forests of crystal thorns floor a cathedral of shifting clouds, oceans rise to meet the inverted heavens, and entire cities fall from the sky only to disappear in pillars of scented smoke. The deeper I go, the closer I come to questioning: Is this a journey taken, or a descent into the boundaries of the self — where desire and terror dissolve into one?

*I wake into a moment of silence. But I am still dreaming.*
