I am dreaming.

In this dusky, prismatic realm where the edges of reality shimmer like heat mirages, I become aware of a peculiar, symphonic power thrumming just beneath my skin. Each breath is musical—the air itself a chorus of unseen notes. As I exhale, I hum, and the earth tingles beneath my feet, waiting.

Timidly, I approach a gnarled tree, its bark grey and crumbling with age. I hesitate, then begin to sing—soft, trembling syllables shaped by curiosity. The melody waltzes around the trunk, drifting like colored mist. Where my song touches, the bark quivers and dissolves into spun glass. The once-dull surface refracts the moonlight into rivers of iridescent brilliance, and the tree, as if waking from centuries of sleep, rustles with crystalline leaves that ring like distant wind chimes.

Overcome with delight, I kneel beside a pooled patch of mud, humming now a tune sharp and lilting—a melody leaping from note to note like a playful breeze. The mud shivers, bubbling up in golden-orange surges, then solidifies into amber, transparent and warm under my fingers. Encased within it are tiny, dream-insects, their wings glinting as if frozen in a dance of their own.

Emboldened, I stride to a crumbling wall of ancient bricks half-swallowed by moss. My song is low and mournful, a cello's lament. The wall undulates, sighs, and becomes a tapestry of living vines and blooming night-flowers. Their petals unfurl in time with my rhythm, releasing the scent of forgotten summers and grief that has learned to let go.

With each transformation, my confidence blooms. Rivers flicker into ribbons of mercury, pebbles blossom into star-shaped lilies, and even the moon above, when I let a sonorous phrase roll skyward, melts into a lantern that floats nearby, trailing silver trails like a curious firefly.

Everything hums with possibilities, everything waits to be sung anew. I laugh, my voice swirling over the landscape, and the world—my world—begins to sway and dance, its shapes eager for the next song.
