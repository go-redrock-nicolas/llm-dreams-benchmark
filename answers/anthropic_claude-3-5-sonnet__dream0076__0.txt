I am dreaming. The velvet curtain ripples before me like a living thing, and beyond it, I can hear the collective breath of thousands - no, millions - held in anticipation. My palms are slick with sweat as I stand in the wings of what seems to be the most massive stage I've ever encountered, its polished boards stretching endlessly into the darkness. The spotlights above pulse with an almost supernatural intensity, and I can feel their heat even from here.

But something is terribly wrong. Looking down at my hands, I notice they're becoming transparent, like morning mist dissolving in sunlight. Panic rises in my throat as I realize my carefully rehearsed performance - was it dancing? Music? I can't quite remember - is about to be broadcast to screens across every continent, streaming into billions of devices, and my body is literally fading away.

The stage manager, whose face keeps morphing between that of my childhood teacher and a silver-furred fox, is counting down. "Thirty seconds!" she announces, her voice echoing unnaturally.

I try to speak, to warn someone, but my voice comes out as butterfly wings, iridescent and fleeting, scattering into the air. The curtain begins to part, and I can see the audience - their faces are mirrors, reflecting infinite versions of my disappearing self. The music starts, a haunting melody that seems to be composed of whale songs and distant thunder.

My feet begin to move of their own accord, pulling me toward the stage even as I feel myself becoming less and less substantial. The world's eyes are about to witness something unprecedented - not the performance they expected, but the gradual vanishing of a person into pure light and shadow...

The spotlights intensify, and I can see my transparency casting prismatic rainbows across the stage. Perhaps this dissolution is the real performance, an unplanned metamorphosis broadcast across the globe. As I step into the light, I feel myself becoming one with the radiance, my essence scattering like stardust...
