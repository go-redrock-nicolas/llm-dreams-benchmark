I am dreaming. The air around me shimmers like liquid gold, thick with tension, as I stand in the middle of an endless library. Its towering shelves spiral into a violet sky where constellations blink like unread pages. My friend, their silhouette edged in flickering candlelight, stands across from me, their face a storm of emotions.  

"You don’t understand," they say, their voice echoing as if spoken from the depths of a cavern. "This isn’t just about choice—it’s about what’s *possible*."  

Around us, the books shift, their spines rearranging into new languages I’ve never seen. Symbols slither across the covers, pulse with life, and whisper secrets in a tongue I almost—*almost*—recognize. The very shelves sway like trees in a phantom wind, and with each passing second, gravity seems to loosen its grip.  

I try to respond, but my words crystallize in the air, hanging between us like jagged diamonds. Frustration bubbles up inside me until it flares—*literally*—a burst of blue fire igniting from my fingertips, licking at the edges of our argument.  

Then, my friend does the impossible.  

They reach into their chest and pulls out their own heart—not the gory, mortal kind, but a glowing orb of intertwined light and shadow. "This is what I’m fighting for," they whisper, and suddenly I see fleeting visions *inside* it—a labyrinth of doors, a city suspended in jellyfish clouds, a child laughing underwater.  

The dream trembles. The shelves collapse into waves of ink, the floor dissolves beneath me, and for a heartbeat, I’m falling—  

—until I wake, breathless, their answer still burning in my mind, just out of reach.
