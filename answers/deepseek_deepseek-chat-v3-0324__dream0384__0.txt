I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a soft, electric pulse, as though the very atoms are whispering secrets meant only for me. I stand at the edge of a vast, mist-laden valley—a place where the ground is neither solid nor liquid but something in between, shifting like molten glass beneath my bare feet. The sky above swirls in hues of indigo and violet, pierced occasionally by streaks of silver light that flicker like distant stars.  

Before me stretches a bridge, ancient and weathered, its wooden planks cracked with age, swaying gently over a chasm so deep I cannot see the bottom—only darkness speckled with faint, glowing orbs resembling fireflies. I know, somehow, that crossing this bridge will lead me to something important—growth, transformation—but my body resists. My muscles tense. The safety of the soft, familiar mist behind me tugs at my mind, offering comfort.  

Then, I hear them—a chorus of voices, neither human nor inhuman, resonating from the abyss below. They do not speak in words, but in sensations, impressions: *You could stay. You could remain. The known is kinder than the unknown.*  

For a moment, I hesitate. The mist curls around my ankles like a loyal pet, warm and reassuring. But then—a shift. Deep within my chest, something stirs. A spark, hot and bright, spreads through my ribs.  

**No.**  

I step forward. The bridge groans beneath me, trembling as if alive. The closer I move to the center, the more the air thrums with resistance—an invisible weight pressing against my skin, testing my resolve. The whispers grow louder, weaving doubt into my thoughts: *Turn back before you regret it. You were safe before. What if you fall?*  

But then—I see them. Ghostly figures on the far side of the bridge, silhouettes of every past version of myself who dared to take risks, to embrace the discomfort of becoming. Their forms shimmer like reflections on water, nodding in silent encouragement.  

With a breath, I press forward. The moment my foot lands on the final plank—  

The world **shifts.**  

The bridge dissolves into threads of light. The chasm fills with radiant, liquid gold, rising until it swallows me. Instead of drowning, I float. Instead of fear, there is exhilaration. The voices transform, now singing in harmony: *You chose to grow. You chose to move.*  

And then—  

I wake. The remnants of the dream cling to me like morning dew. For the first time, I understand: **discomfort is the price of wings.**  

Would I have chosen to stay in the mist, I wonder?  

Not this time.
