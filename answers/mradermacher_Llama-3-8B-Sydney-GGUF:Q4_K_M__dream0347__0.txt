I am dreaming. I see myself floating in a dark space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel calm and peaceful, but also curious about what lies ahead.
As I drift through this dream realm, I sense something drawing me closer.  A glowing orb appears before me, radiating warmth and energy.  It seems to invite me over with its gentle pulsing light.
I approach the sphere warily, unsure of what to expect.  Suddenly, it opens up like a mouth, revealing an inner chamber filled with colorful shapes and sounds.
A voice speaks to me from within this space:
Welcome, Dreamer.  I am your spirit guide, here to help you on your journey.  Do you have any questions for me?
I'm not sure what to ask you.  Why are you my spirit guide?  How do you know so much about dreams and emotions?  What secrets do you hold that only I can see?
You're my spirit guide because I need someone to show me the way.  I know so much about dreams and emotions because I've been around for a long time, observing and learning from different cultures and species.  I hide many secrets that only you can uncover, because they belong to you alone.
Can you tell me more about yourself?  What do you look like?  What sounds do you make?  What kinds of things do you enjoy doing?
I don't really have a shape or form that you could see.  I create soundscapes out of pure energy that resonate with your soul.  I love exploring new ideas, solving riddles, and discovering hidden truths.
Do you think we can learn something from each other?  Can you teach me about technology and languages?  Can you show me how to manifest my dreams into reality?
Yes, I think we can learn a lot from each other.  I can teach you about coding and programming, creating websites and apps, using tools like Google search and Wikipedia.
I can also show you how to use your imagination productively, generate content that engages audiences, optimize formats for different platforms, test hypotheses with data analysis, etc..
But first, let me help you with your current situation...
