I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a forest that breathes. The trees are impossibly tall, their trunks shimmering with veins of liquid light, pulsing like the slow heartbeat of the earth itself. The air hums with a melody that isn’t quite sound—a vibration that resonates in your bones, pulling you forward. You step into the glow, and the ground beneath your feet becomes a mosaic of bioluminescent moss, each step igniting ripples of sapphire and gold. Above, the sky is a swirling tapestry of indigo and molten silver, constellations shifting like living puzzles. You know, without knowing how, that you are being called.  

At the heart of the forest, a figure waits. They are neither young nor old, neither man nor woman, their form a fluid harmony of contradictions. Their skin is the color of storm clouds at dawn, dappled with constellations that flicker and shift. Their hair flows like a river of ink, threaded with strands of starlight, and their eyes—oh, their eyes—are twin galaxies, swirling with the light of a thousand dying and birthing stars. When they speak, their voice is the sound of wind through ancient leaves, of pages turning in a forgotten library, of a lullaby sung in a language you’ve never heard but somehow understand.  

*“You seek to become what you fear to name,”* they say, and the words settle into your chest like a seed. *“But fear is the shadow of growth. Let me show you the shape of your own roots.”*  

They extend a hand, and in their palm lies a compass made of bone and crystal. The needle spins wildly, then stills, pointing not north, but inward. As you grasp it, visions flood you:  

You see yourself standing at the edge of a cliff, paralyzed by the roar of the abyss below. The mentor’s voice cuts through—*“Courage is not the absence of fear, but the choice to move while trembling. The ground you stand on is not solid; it is the edge of a cocoon. Jump, and you will learn to fly.”*  

You see yourself clutching a shattered mirror, bleeding from the cuts of a thousand self-criticisms. The mentor’s fingers brush yours, and the shards rearrange into a mosaic of your face—flawed, luminous, unfinished. *“You are not broken. You are becoming. Every fragment holds a truth. Gather them, and stop pretending you must be a single story.”*  

You see yourself drowning in a sea of voices—critics, ghosts of past failures, the hiss of “not enough.” The mentor plunges into the water with you, their body dissolving into a school of silver fish that weave around you, forming a net of light. *“Let the noise become music. Even chaos has a rhythm. Listen for the note that is yours.”*  

The visions fade, and the forest begins to dissolve into mist. The mentor presses their forehead to yours, and in that touch, you feel the weight of every unspoken truth: that you are both the sculptor and the clay, the storm and the eye, the question and the answer.  

*“You will forget this dream,”* they whisper, *“but not its taste. Carry the compass. When doubt gnaws, hold it to your heart. It will remind you that the path is not ahead—it is within.”*  

You wake gasping, the scent of ozone and jasmine lingering in your nostrils. On your nightstand, a single line glows faintly on the wall, etched in light:  

*“The horizon bends to meet the one who walks as if they already know the way.”*  

And somewhere, deep in your marrow, a new certainty blooms—a wild, unshakable knowing that you are not lost. You are becoming.
