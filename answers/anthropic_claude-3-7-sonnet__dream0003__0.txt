I am dreaming. Before me rests an enigmatic box, its surface adorned with mesmerizing patterns that seem to shift subtly under my gaze. The wood is ancient—perhaps mahogany or something far older—polished to a deep luster that reflects candlelight I don't remember lighting. Intricate carvings wind across its surface: serpentine forms that might be writing in a forgotten language, geometric shapes that appear to reconfigure themselves when I blink, and tiny constellations that somehow mirror the night sky of a world I've never visited.

My fingers trace the cold metal clasps, weathered bronze or perhaps copper with a patina speaking of centuries. There's no keyhole—at least not one that resembles anything conventional. Instead, there's a circular depression with spiraling grooves that seem to pull my gaze inward, creating a dizzying sensation of falling.

The room around me begins to blur. The walls breathe and pulse with a soft blue luminescence. The air grows heavy with the scent of petrichor and something sweeter—like jasmine blooming in a forgotten garden after midnight rain.

As I hold the box, it warms in my hands, vibrating with a gentle hum that resonates in my chest. Suddenly, I realize the box isn't locked by a physical key at all—it responds to thought, to emotion, to memory. The patterns on its surface begin to align with my heartbeat, and I understand that I've always had the key.

The lid creaks open, releasing a swirl of golden light that envelops me. Inside is not an object but a doorway—a passage to somewhere both intimately familiar and utterly unknown. Beyond the threshold lies a landscape of impossible geography: floating islands connected by bridges of light, trees with crystalline leaves that chime in a breeze carrying whispers of forgotten conversations, mountains that curve upward to meet an aurora-painted sky.

I step through, knowing I've returned to a place I've never been.
