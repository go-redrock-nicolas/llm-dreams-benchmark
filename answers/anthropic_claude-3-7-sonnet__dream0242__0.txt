I am dreaming. I find myself in the stark, gleaming control room of the Helios Nuclear Facility, bathed in the harsh glow of emergency lighting. Banks of monitors line the curved walls, each displaying cascading failures across reactor cores 2 through 5. Warning klaxons wail—not the standard drill alert, but the deep, primal tone reserved for genuine catastrophe.

My fingers fly across holographic interfaces as colleagues move in choreographed panic around me. The primary cooling systems failed twenty minutes ago. The backups lasted eight minutes. The emergency tertiary systems are now faltering, pressure building inexorably in the reactor chambers. Outside the reinforced windows, I can see storm clouds gathering, as if nature itself senses the impending disaster.

"Conventional containment failing at sectors 7 through 12," announces a calm AI voice that belies our desperate situation. "Radiation breach imminent. Estimated metropolitan exposure in 47 minutes."

The facility director, her face ashen, meets my eyes. "The evacuation won't be complete in time."

A strange clarity washes over me. Time seems to slow as I recall theoretical protocols buried in classified archives—emergency measures deemed too experimental for implementation. I move to a restricted terminal, my security clearance opening doors in the system that shouldn't exist.

"What are you doing?" whispers my assistant, watching as I initiate quantum dampening fields never tested outside simulation.

"Something impossible," I reply, typing commands that redirect the facility's entire power grid through experimental superconductors beneath the facility. The lights dim completely before emergency generators kick in.

The solution is beautiful in its terrible elegance—creating a contained temporal distortion field that will essentially remove the failing reactor cores from our timeline long enough for complete evacuation.

As I activate the final sequence, energy crackles across my skin. The air shimmers with ozone and possibility. The facility begins to hum at a frequency I feel in my bones rather than hear...

And then I wake up, heart pounding, the memory of numbers and equations fading like morning mist, leaving only the lingering sense of having briefly held the fate of thousands in my trembling hands.
