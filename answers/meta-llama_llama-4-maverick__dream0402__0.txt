I am dreaming. As I float on a serene lake, the water's surface mirrors the sky above, a perfect blend of blues and whites. But beneath this tranquility, a volcano stirs. It's an underwater volcano, its presence felt through the gentle tremors that vibrate through the water, causing the surface to ripple and distort the reflection of the sky. I'm in a small boat, anchored above this hidden force, feeling the subtle vibrations through the wooden hull.

The dream begins to intensify as the volcano starts to erupt. Molten lava pours into the water, creating clouds of steam that rise to the surface, veiling the sky. The lake's calm demeanor is disrupted; waves start to form, gently at first, then with increasing ferocity. The boat rocks violently, and I hold tight to its edges, feeling a mix of fear and exhilaration.

As the eruption continues, the steam clears, revealing a figure standing in the water, amidst the swirling lava. It's me, or a version of me, standing tall and unwavering. This figure doesn't flinch as the hot lava swirls around, its presence a testament to resilience. I realize this figure represents my suppressed anger, finally surfacing.

The anger takes on a life of its own, manifesting as a being made of flames and shadow. It stands there, a powerful entity that commands respect. Yet, as I watch, it begins to change, its flames burning with a softer light, its shadowy form taking on contours that are more defined, more human.

The lake's turmoil subsides as the volcano's eruption ceases. The water returns to its calm state, reflecting the sky once more, but now with a slight tint of red from the lava that has cooled on its surface. The figure made of flames and shadow approaches me in the boat. As it draws near, it transforms into a reflection of myself, standing in the water, now calm and serene.

This reflection speaks, its voice a gentle echo in my mind. It tells me that anger is not something to be feared but understood and respected. It's a part of me, a signal that something needs attention, a call to action or change. The reflection explains that by acknowledging and accepting this emotion, I can harness its power, using it to fuel positive change rather than letting it control me.

As the dream fades, I'm left with a sense of peace and a newfound understanding. The journey through the dream has been a journey into the depths of my own emotions, a confrontation with the parts of myself I've tried to suppress. I'm more aware now, aware that my anger is a valid emotion, one that can be expressed healthily, and that doing so can lead to personal growth and a more balanced life.
