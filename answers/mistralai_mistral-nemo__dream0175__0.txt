I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a sheer cliff, the sun a crimson orb dipping low on the horizon, casting long, dancing shadows that flicker like malevolent spirits. The wind whips around me, stinging my skin with tiny, icy daggers, carrying with it the faintest echoes of ancient, long-forgotten languages. The scent of ozone and distant rain clings to the air, heralding a storm that threatens to break at any moment.

The cliff face before me is a monolithic wall of obsidian, slick and glistening under the dying light, a deep, abyssal blackness that seems to absorb every struggling ray of sunlight. Carved into the rock are three enormous stone columns, each one taller and wider than the most ancient, gnarled oak. They stretch high into the dimming sky, like the fingers of a forgotten giant reaching out from the depths, grasping at the heavens above.

The challenge? To scale these columns and reach the summit. A simple task, perhaps, if it were not for the fact that the columns are spaced impossibly far apart, each one separated by a chasm so vast and deep that even my phobia of heights cannot comprehend its extent. And worse still, the columns are not merely unclimbable - they are positively hostile. They have a texture like oiled glass, slippery and smooth as the oily skin of some nightmarish serpent, offering no purchase for hands or feet. Moreover, they seem to emit a low, pulsating hum, like a heartbeat recession, and I feel a strange, alien sort of pressure radiating from them, pushing back against my ogniest attempts to approach.

But I must try. There is something out there, beyond the peak. A call, a whisper on the wind that only I can hear, a plea for help that I cannot ignore, no matter how insurmountable the odds, no matter how far beyond my imagined limits this challenge seems to be. I draw a deep breath, steeling myself, feeling the storm gather and build behind me, and take the first, tentative step into the void.
