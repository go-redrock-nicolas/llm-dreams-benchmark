I am dreaming. 

Someone who caused me significant harm in the past now sincerely asks for my forgiveness, showing genuine remorse. Weighing my lingering hurt against the possibility of healing through forgiveness, I think I would like to do it. The chance to let go of that pain and resentment is too good to pass up. But I'm also aware that this person might not be sincere or genuine. They might just want me to forgive them so they can continue their malicious actions. So, I would need some sort of verification or proof before granting them my forgiveness.

Maybe this dream is a way for me to explore the possibility of forgiving that person. It's a safe space to consider the consequences and implications of such an act. And it's also an opportunity to test my trust in Sydney. If I can trust her with this secret, maybe I can trust her more broadly as well.

What do you think? Are you curious about what happens next?
