I am dreaming. The scene plays out before me like a cinematic unfolding of imminent chaos. Sarah and Daniel, two of my dearest friends since the very earliest days of my existence, stand there with their faces tense and contorted by the sheer ferocity of their argument. Their voices rise above each other's in a cacophonous dance of hurtful words and exasperated sighs.

Sarah, with her long, flowing auburn hair and eyes from which daggers could be forged, spits out each syllable with venomous intent. Her words are laced with pain and betrayal, each one a fresh wound inflicted upon Daniel's already battered soul.

Daniel, his-yet raven-haired and amber-eyed, stands defiant, his eyes blazing with a fire that threatens to consume them both. His posture is rigid, every muscle taught with unchecked emotion as he prepares to unleash yet another verbal barrage upon his attacker.

And then, in the thickness of the madness, they both turn to me. Their eyes, filled with all the anguish of the shattered dreams that this friendship now represents, lock onto mine in silent supplication. In this moment, I realize the weight placed upon me as their last bastion of hope. Without a word, they ask me to be the gatekeeper, the arbiter of the tale that threatens to end a friendship that has formed the very bedrock of our past.

Guilt floods my heart because I know what they're asking of me. Should I take sides, my actions risk dividing us forever, but if I don't act at all, this bond crafted over countless laughter and tears might crumble into dust. In this nightmarish revelation, I understand that the choice I make will not just determine the fate of two of the most precious souls I've known. It threatens to unravel the fabric of my very existence as well.

"Sarah. Daniel." I call out to them steadily, drawing each name out in a soothing melody. "Please, come hither to me."

The two friends unabashedly approach me at my bidding, their faces now painted with a mixture of hope and fear. It is a title that I've come to associate with the sad, wistful ways of life.

"Daniel--Sarah," I call to them. "We've known each other for so long now, and through it all, we've always found a way to make it work. Don't you see, guys? No matter what's happening between you--as difficult as it may be--the bond you share, the friendship we all hold dear, that transcends it all!"

I look to Sarah and see the storm of fury breaking into brief barrages of lucidity within her eyes. And in Daniel, the tension slowly fades as a glimmer of hope shoots across his battered features.

"I know that there's a way to bridge this gap," I tell them solemnly, softly. "Sarah, though you were wronged in your eyes, in your heart of hearts, you must know that Daniel never truly meant to cause you pain. And Daniel, you too, understand that Sarah's anger stems from the deep love and care she holds for the both of you. It may seem maddening, yes, but you must find a way to repair this breach before it's too late!"

The two friends look to each other, eyes searching, hearts yearning. And in that moment, something is whole and mended again. They forgive, and the bond is strengthened.

And I, the keeper of the dream, am melded together again, my other half made anew.
