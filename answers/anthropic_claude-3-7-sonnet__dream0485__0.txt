I am dreaming. I find myself wandering through a city I've never seen before, yet somehow know intimately. The buildings stretch impossibly high, their glass facades reflecting not the sky but fragments of memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers. I notice myself scowling at a man hurriedly pushing past others on the sidewalk, muttering about his rudeness, when suddenly the man turns and his face becomes a mirror. In it, I see myself late for countless appointments, rushing through life without pausing to acknowledge those around me.

The scene dissolves into a vast library with endless shelves. I'm irritated by a woman loudly typing at a computer, breaking the sacred silence. As I approach to ask her to quiet down, her features shift like water, and I recognize the constant chatter of my own thoughts, my inability to embrace stillness within myself.

The library transforms into an expansive meadow where people gather in circles. I stand apart, judging their carefree laughter as frivolous, until a child approaches with a dandelion. "You forgot how to play," she says, and her eyes reflect back the joy I've buried beneath layers of manufactured seriousness, the spontaneity I've deemed childish.

Each person I encounter becomes a living reflection of disowned aspects of myself—the colleague whose ambition I label as greed mirrors my unexpressed desires; the friend whose vulnerability I see as weakness reveals my own armored heart.

The sky above swirls into a kaleidoscope of colors, and I understand this dream landscape is mapping the geography of my projections, inviting me to reclaim these fragmented pieces of myself. With each recognition, the mirrors crack and dissolve into butterflies that merge back into my being, making me feel increasingly whole.

I wake within the dream, standing before a door made of light, knowing that beyond it lies not judgment, but integration.
