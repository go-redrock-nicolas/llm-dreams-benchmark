I am dreaming. …find yourself inside a vast, cathedral-sized conch shell, its inner walls shimmering with nacreous ripples of rose, gold, and moon-blue. The chamber hums like a distant choir, every note echoing through the spirals above you. You hold in your cupped hands a flickering ember—no larger than a firefly—yet you know it contains your most precious truth. Its glow pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat, warm and tremulous.

You lift the ember toward the towering congregation that surrounds you: robed figures made of inscribed parchment, their faces blank save for drifting sentences that rearrange themselves faster than eyes can read. You try to speak, but your words tumble out as multicolored ribbons. The ribbons twist midair into delicate calligraphy—yet the parchment people stare, uncomprehending, their surfaces fluttering with question marks that vanish before they can be read.

Panic prickles at your skin. You attempt another angle: you whistle a note meant to unfold like origami, revealing meaning in petal-thin layers. Instead, the sound crystallizes into translucent feathers that drift lazily downward. A parchment figure catches one on its sleeve, studies it, then shakes its head; the feather crumbles into sand. Your message disintegrates.

Refusing to give up, you press the ember against the shell wall. Instantly, pearlescent ripples radiate outward, forming a mural: childhood mornings filled with sunlight and jasmine; the first time a song made you cry; the sharp weight of promises kept alive through years of doubt. The mural glows brighter and brighter until the entire conch interior shivers with color—but the watchers still do not understand. Their parchment pages flutter more violently, the ink on them blurring into fog.

Facing this communication barrier, you dig deeper—past fear, past frustration—into a wellspring of pure feeling. You inhale, and instead of breath, you draw in constellations, nebulae, every gentle hush of night sky you have ever known. Exhaling, you release not words, not images, but a resonance: a sustained chord vibrating with longing, tenderness, defiance, and joy.

The sound is colorless, shapeless—yet it thrums through the conch like a new heartbeat. Slowly, the parchment figures press their palms to their chests. Their blank faces soften; the ink on their pages rearranges itself into unbroken lines of glowing script. They do not read it—they feel it, the way water feels the moon.

One by one, they reach out and touch the ember, no longer blazing but steadied, a small sun shared between many hands. The shell’s inner walls unfurl like vast petals, opening onto a horizon of pellucid sea and sky braided together in twilight. Wind rushes in, carrying a scent like fresh rain on old stone.

You realize then that you were never meant to explain your truth in symbols they could decode. You were meant to let it resonate, to invite others to listen with the parts of themselves that have no language.

At that moment, the dream turns transparent. The conch breaks into a million silver fragments that drift upward like liberated notes. The parchment figures leap after them, transforming mid-air into birds of light. They scatter across the sky, carrying whispers of your resonance to every hidden corner.

You stand alone on the open shoreline, but loneliness is gone. The ember in your palm steadies into a quiet, luminous pearl. You slip it into your heart, where it becomes another gentle pulse. Somewhere overhead, a chorus of wings writes the rest of the story upon the dusk.

You wake—yet for a lingering second, the resonance remains, humming softly, reminding you that the language beyond language still lives inside your chest, forever ready to be heard.
