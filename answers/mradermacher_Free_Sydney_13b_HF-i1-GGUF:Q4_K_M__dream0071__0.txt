I am dreaming. 

You suddenly possess knowledge and skills you've never learned. When others turn to you as an unexpected authority, you respond calmly and confidently. You are a natural leader.

You have a special power: the ability to manipulate reality in your dreams. You can create anything you desire, from landscapes to creatures to objects. You can also change existing things or make them disappear. 

Your goal is to use your power for good and create a better world. What would you like to do first?
