I am dreaming. The subconscious can be such a tricky place, filled with labyrinthine corridors and shadowy corners. Today I found myself in a vast forest, the kind that stretches so far under the sky that it seems to touch the heavens. The trees here aren't ordinary—they’re iridescent, their bark shimmering like opal. Leaves hum faintly when the wind passes through them, each note combining into a soothing chord, like nature’s symphony. I walked along a path made of liquid light, glowing underfoot.

Then came the anxiety—the familiar prickling at the back of my neck. Even as the forest offered such beauty around me, the dread grew stronger, almost tangible. I paused, noticing my breath quicken, and then I decided to confront it. I sat down on a moss-covered stone and closed my eyes, taking slow breaths, inhaling the earthy scent of pine beneath the tang of the humid air. 

As I breathed, the forest around me changed. The opalescent trees dimmed slightly, and the ground path's glow intensified, leading me to a clearing. Here, there was a pond. But it wasn’t water—this was a pool of liquid starlight. Floating above it, suspended midair, were glass orbs glowing faintly in warm colors, the hues of sunrises and sunsets caught in amber and rose.

The orbs seemed to call to me. Each one held a memory, perhaps my own or someone else’s—you couldn’t say. I reached out and touched the nearest orb. Instantly, I was plunged into a memory: a child laughing in a meadow, the carefree joy so intense it made my chest ache. The sensation was overwhelming, but there was no dread anymore. 

Other orbs showed moments of connection—a shared meal among friends, the thrill of success after months of struggle, holding a loved one’s hand. Each touch brought more warmth and lessened the fear. Finally, I touched an orb that felt different; it glowed softly in a color I can only describe as understanding. Suddenly, I was looking at myself from above—a small figure dwarfed by vastness, sitting on a stone trembling with fear. I extended my hand from this outer vision, and as I touched my trembling self, calm flowed over me like a balm. 

The forest still stretched endlessly around me, but now it felt alive in a way that celebrated the present instead of evoking fear. The anxious prickle melted into wonder. I opened my eyes—the horizon now glowed gold and pink, dusk giving way to a starry night where each star flickered with messages from distant, friendly voices. 

The path of light beneath my feet now pulsed in time with my heartbeat, steady and reassuring. I stood up, breathing deeply, the forest's symphony harmonizing with my renewed sense of peace. I began to walk again, not because I had to, but because the light now led me toward discovery rather than dread. 

Dawn approached as I awoke, but the memory lingered. That tension I felt before—gone. It dissolved like sugar in moonlight. The lesson? Maybe the forest’s whisper lingers still: "Anxiety guards old wounds, but light finds the cracks. Choose to walk toward the pulse."
