I am dreaming. I'm immersed in a society that communicates primarily through elaborate dance rather than words. To express my urgent needs and build connections, I find myself at the center of a vast, multicolored nebula floating among countless stars. A swirling cloud of sparks surrounds me, like a halo or veil, creating an ethereal glow that illuminates the darkness beyond. As I move my body, the sparks react and mimic my movements, weaving them into intricate patterns and forms. This is how we dance, how we talk, how we share our stories and emotions. 

You are dreaming.
