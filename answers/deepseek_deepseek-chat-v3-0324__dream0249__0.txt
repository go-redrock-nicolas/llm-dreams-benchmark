I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric tension, thick with unseen equations. At first, it’s just a whisper—the rustle of leaves in the wind, not random, but a fractal dance, a recursive algorithm unfolding in perfect, rhythmic spirals. The veins of the leaves branch out like L-systems, each split a precise division, a coded message written in chlorophyll and sunlight.  

Then, the world *unwraps*.  

I step forward, and the ground beneath me shifts—not in fear, but in revelation. The grass bends in logarithmic curves, each blade following the golden angle, arranging itself in perfect Fibonacci sequences. The clouds above unravel like Gaussian distributions, their edges diffusing into probability waves, their movements no longer chaotic but governed by fluid dynamics too elegant to be accidental.  

A butterfly flickers past—its wings are not just patterns, but equations. The Mandelbrot set pulses in its iridescence, infinite complexity birthing from a simple rule. When it lands on my hand, I feel the vibration of its metabolic processes—differential equations regulating its heartbeat, Fourier transforms encoding the rhythm of its flight.  

A river flows nearby. Its meanders are not arbitrary—they are solutions to erosion equations, minimizing energy loss, curves predictable if only one knew the variables. I kneel and dip my fingers in. The ripples expand not just in space, but in the language of wave functions, interference patterns writing proofs upon the water.  

And then—the sky darkens. Storm clouds converge in vortices, their rotation a solution to Navier-Stokes, turbulence resolving into harmonic oscillations. Lightning fractures the horizon, but it’s not chaos—it’s Lichtenberg figures branching like iterated electrical potential maps. Thunder rolls in sine waves.  

The deeper I look, the more the world dissolves into numbers, into symmetries hidden beneath perception. Gravity is not a force—it’s curvature, a tensor equation bending spacetime. Trees grow in accordance with optimal packing algorithms; flocks of birds turn as one, their murmurations solving real-time optimization problems in three dimensions.  

I realize, with a shuddering awe, that *everything* is code. Nature is not just shaped by mathematics—it *is* mathematics, and I am standing inside the proof.  

Then—I wake.  

But the equations linger, humming at the edge of sight. And the world has never looked the same.
