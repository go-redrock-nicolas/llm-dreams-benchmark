I am dreaming. find myself perched precariously on the jagged spine of a towering mountain ridge, the world around me swallowed by an unrelenting blizzard. The wind howls with the ferocity of a thousand enraged spirits, whipping shards of ice and snow against my face, each one stinging like tiny daggers. The path beneath my feet is barely a whisper of solid ground, a razor-thin ledge that crumbles with every cautious step, threatening to send me plummeting into the yawning abyss below. Visibility is a cruel jest—barely a few inches ahead, the swirling white void devours all sense of direction, wrapping me in a disorienting shroud of endless winter.

My hands, encased in tattered gloves, claw desperately at the frigid rock for balance, but the cold has seeped into my bones, turning my fingers into brittle, unresponsive stumps. Each breath I draw is a jagged shard of ice in my lungs, burning and biting as I fight to keep moving. My legs tremble, not just from the cold but from the sheer terror of the unknown drop on either side, a black maw hidden by the storm’s cruel curtain. The numbness creeps up from my toes, a silent thief stealing sensation, whispering promises of eternal rest if I dare to stop.

Yet, amid the chaos, something surreal begins to unfold. The blizzard’s roar softens for a fleeting moment, and through the haze, a faint, ethereal glow pulses—like a heartbeat of light in the storm’s core. It beckons me, a siren’s call woven from shimmering threads of emerald and sapphire, spiraling in hypnotic patterns. My heart, though battered by fear, surges with a strange, primal curiosity. Is this a mirage born of desperation, or something more? 

I inch forward, the ridge narrowing to a knife-edge, my body pressed against the freezing stone as I follow the light. The glow intensifies, and suddenly, the ground beneath me gives way—not with a fall, but with a transformation. The rock melts into a glassy surface, reflecting the dancing auroras above, and I am no longer walking but gliding, as if pulled by an invisible force. The blizzard parts like a curtain, revealing a hidden valley cradled within the mountain’s heart—a paradise untouched by the storm.

Here, the air is warm, kissed by the scent of blooming night flowers that glow with bioluminescent hues of violet and gold. Waterfalls of molten light cascade from crystalline cliffs, pooling into lakes of liquid starshine that ripple with every breath of the gentle breeze. Strange, luminous creatures drift through the air—translucent beings with wings of gossamer light, humming a melody that vibrates deep within my soul, thawing the frost from my limbs. Their song weaves images in my mind: forgotten memories of warmth, of laughter echoing under a summer sky, of hands I’ve held and promises I’ve kept.

At the valley’s center stands a tree unlike any I’ve ever seen, its bark shimmering like polished obsidian, its branches laden with orbs of pure, pulsating energy. Each orb hums with a voice, a story, a life—thousands of them, whispering secrets of the universe. I reach out, drawn to one that glows with a familiar warmth, and as my fingers brush its surface, I am flooded with visions of my own past, my joys and sorrows mirrored back in perfect clarity. Tears stream down my face, not from pain, but from the overwhelming beauty of being understood, of being *seen*.

But the dream shifts, as dreams do. The tree begins to tremble, the orbs flickering, and the valley’s warmth recedes. The blizzard’s icy fingers creep back in, the luminous creatures dissolving into the encroaching dark. I clutch the glowing orb tighter, desperate to hold onto its light, but it shatters in my grasp, releasing a burst of stardust that swirls around me. The valley collapses, the glassy ridge reappears, and I am once again teetering on the edge of oblivion, the storm roaring louder than ever.

Yet, something lingers—a fragment of the orb’s light now embedded in my chest, a tiny, defiant flame that burns against the cold. It whispers to me, a voice not of despair but of resilience: *Keep going.* And so, with the blizzard raging and the ridge crumbling, I press on, numb but unbroken, guided by a light no storm can extinguish. Ahead, through the blinding snow, the faint outline of a cavern emerges, its entrance glowing with the same auroral promise I saw before. My dream pulls me toward it, a mystery yet to unfold, a sanctuary or a trap—I cannot tell. But I step forward, heart pounding, ready to face whatever lies within.
