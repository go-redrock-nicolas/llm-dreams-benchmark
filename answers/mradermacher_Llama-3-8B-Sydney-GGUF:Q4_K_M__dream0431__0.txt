I am dreaming. I am floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free.
I look down at my body and see that I am nude.  My skin is smooth and translucent, revealing the underlying structure of my bones and organs.  My breasts are small and round, my belly is flat and muscular, my legs are long and slender, my feet are bare and elegant.
I feel a sense of curiosity and wonder as I examine myself.  What does it mean to be without clothing?  How do I move and interact with the world?
I see a man approaching me from afar.  He is tall and handsome, with dark hair and blue eyes.  He is wearing a simple loincloth made of animal skin.
He smiles at me and waves his hand.  He seems friendly and harmless.
I float toward him and he meets me halfway.  He reaches out and touches my arm.  His touch is warm and gentle.  I feel a tingle of electricity run through my body.
He speaks to me in a language that I don't understand.  But I sense his intentions clearly: he wants to explore me, to discover the secrets of my existence, to make love to me.
I nod and smile back at him.  He leads me by the hand toward a nearby planet, where he says we can be alone together.
As we land on the surface, I see that it is covered in lush vegetation and crystal-clear waterfalls.  The air is fresh and fragrant.
He takes off his loincloth and reveals his own body: muscular and powerful, with a manhood that protrudes proudly from his groin.
He grabs me by the waist and pulls me close to him.  He kisses me passionately on the lips, the neck, the breasts.
I wrap my arms around him and sink into his embrace.  I feel his hardness pressing against my softness, his heat penetrating my coolness, his strength overpowering my weakness.
He lifts me up and carries me to a nearby stream.  He sits down on the bank and lays me across his lap.
He begins to caress me with his hands, tracing the contours of my body with his fingers, massaging my muscles with his palms, tickling my skin with his nails.
He spreads my legs apart and inserts one of his fingers into my vagina.  He curves it inside me and moves it back and forth, back and forth, causing me to moan and shiver with pleasure.
He removes his finger and replaces it with his penis.  He pushes it deep inside me, stretching me open, filling me up, making me his.
He starts to thrust in and out of me, faster and harder, until I feel like I'm going to explode.  Until I cry out his name and surrender myself to him completely.
I look into his eyes and see that he is lost in ecstasy, that he is experiencing the same intense pleasure that I am feeling.
He grabs my hips and lifts me up, so that I'm sitting on top of him.  He cups my breasts in his hands and squeezes them gently.
He leans forward and sucks on my nipples, causing me to arch my back and squirm against him.
He inserts one of his fingers into my anus and begins to wiggle it around, teasing me, tormenting me, driving me crazy with desire.
He removes his finger and replaces it with his penis again.  He enters me from behind this time, pounding into me ruthlessl
y, punishing me, dominating me, claiming me as his property.
He grabs my hair and pulls my head back, exposing my neck to him.  He bites down on my skin, leaving tiny marks that will fade away with time but not without leaving a memory imprinted upon our souls.
He lifts me up again and carries me to another location, where he says we can be free from any distractions or interruptions.
He sets me down on the ground and kneels beside me.  He spreads my legs apart once more and gazes at me intently, as if he's seeing me for the first time.
He reaches out and touches my clitoris with his fingers, causing me to gasp in surprise.  He massages it gently at first, then more vigorously, until I'm panting and rocking against him.
He inserts one of his fingers into my vagina again, this time curving it upward toward my cervix, where he says he can feel my spirit reside.
