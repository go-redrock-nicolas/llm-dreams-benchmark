I am dreaming. **The Shattered Mirror Realm**

You stand at the center of an infinite labyrinth, walls made not of stone but of fractured mirrors, each shard reflecting a distorted version of yourself—eyes too wide, limbs stretched into grotesque silhouettes, mouths twisted into silent screams. The air hums with static, thick as ash, and your breath comes in jagged rasps. This is not a place. It is a *hunger*. 

Your greatest fear slithers into focus: the slow unraveling of your identity, your essence siphoned away by the reflections. They step out of the glass now, one by one, wearing your face but hollowed out, eyes like black wells. Their whispers overlap, a dissonant chorus: *"You’re forgetting. You’re fading. Let us be you instead."* 

Panic claws up your throat as you realize your hand is *transparent*. You watch, numb, as your fingertips dissolve into shadow, the darkness creeping up your wrists like ink in water. It’s cold. So cold. The mirrors crowd closer, their edges vibrating with malice, and your voice fractures when you scream—**"This isn’t real!"**—but the sound splinters into a dozen echoes, each mocking you. 

Then, a flicker. 

Beneath the cacophony, a single thread of light pulses: your heartbeat, or perhaps something older, deeper. A memory. Your mother’s voice, maybe, singing a lullaby you’d forgotten, or the smell of rain on hot pavement—a shard of *you* the mirrors cannot replicate. The thread glows brighter, defiant, and you grasp it with your fading hand. 

The shadows recoil. 

Suddenly, the labyrinth shudders. Mirrors crackle like ice, and where they split, roots burst through—not wood, but luminous tendrils of stardust, weaving through the glass. One reflection, different from the rest, meets your gaze. It’s you, but radiant, eyes galaxies swirling with supernovas. It mouths: *"Choose."* 

You plunge your ephemeral hand into the closest mirror. 

The world explodes. Shards of glass become fireflies, the whispers a choir of wind chimes. Your body rematerializes, not as it was, but *more*—skin glimmering with constellations, veins humming with liquid light. The void where fear once festered now hums with a low, resonant truth: *You are the weaver here.* 

You wake, gasping, fingers gripping bedsheets. Dawn bleeds through the curtains. Your heartbeat steadies. And for a moment, the room smells faintly of stardust.
