I am dreaming.

The dream opens like a curtain made of soft aurora lights, parting to reveal a colossal gallery that floats in star-dusted darkness. Think of a museum carved from moonstone, each wall a waterfall of slow-moving constellations. I drift—half walking, half gliding—across the onyx floor, footsteps rippling in liquid reflections of nebulas. I do not know why I’ve come here, but there is a hush of anticipation in the air, as though the universe is holding its breath.

Suddenly an unseen bell chimes—a warm, resonant sound that trembles straight into my bones—and the ceiling blooms into a thousand lanterns. They flicker alive like fireflies, forming a vast, glowing canopy. When their light reaches me, a chorus of voices erupts overhead, not loud, but bright: gentle thunderclouds filled with applause. “There!” they proclaim, “There is the one who planted the single seed!”

I stall, confused. Seed? What seed? I scan the immensity around me for clarification, heart pinging between awe and bewilderment. Then, as if memory itself has materialized, a tiny sapling appears before me: a sapling no higher than my knee, shimmering with dewdrops that refract rainbow shards. I recognize it with a jolt—the littlest hopeful gesture I made months, perhaps years ago: a moment when I encouraged a stranger with a kind word, posted an idea into the ether, or quietly fixed something nobody noticed. In waking life, it registered as trivial, too small to catalogue. Yet here, in this dream-museum of cosmic significance, it stands on a pedestal of starlight like a priceless relic.

And the praise grows louder, layered. Each voice is a note in an impossible chord: teachers I forgot, friends I lost to distance, children not yet born who will one day benefit from a ripple I unintentionally made. Their applause is a wind that lifts me. Gilded banners unfurl from nowhere, inscribed with phrases in languages I don’t know yet somehow understand:

“You shifted the tide.”
“You lit a match in a dark corridor.”
“You kept the thread unbroken.”

My cheeks burn—warmth blossoming out from the center of my chest. A baffled grin tugs at me; I never suspected that such a tiny act mattered. In the faint, sweet dizziness of recognition, I feel something loosen inside, like a knotted rope finally slipping free. It is the weight of quiet self-doubt detaching itself from my ribs.

The walls of the gallery begin to tilt, and every star spills downward, swirling around the sapling. The tree sprouts in fast-forward, its branches unfurling into scrolls of emerald parchment, its leaves turning into translucent crystals that reflect every encouraging phrase ever whispered in secret. Each leaf flashes a name—some I know, many I don’t. Each crystal rings like a distant bell when it pops into being.

A hand, warm and familiar, rests on my shoulder. I turn, expecting a face I recognize, but there is only the shape of light—a silhouette made of dawn. It doesn’t speak with words; instead, it transfers a feeling, like pouring radiance into the hollow of my heart: You have been seen. You matter in ways you cannot inventory. Accept this.

Tears shimmer in my lashes, but they float off like tiny planets before they fall. The glowing figure gestures toward a doorway edged in galaxies. Steps made from folded time appear beneath my feet, rising toward that portal. I climb. With each step, a forgotten success surfaces in my mind: the time I sent a late-night message that saved someone from loneliness, the weekend I recycled a single glass bottle that will now never glint as broken litter on a distant beach, the laugh I coaxed from a grieving friend. The steps themselves seem to form from these memories, solidifying under my weight.

At the threshold I pause. The applause fades to a serene hum, like a lullaby for the cosmos. I inhale a fragrance that can only be described as sunrise—crisp, hopeful, tinged with citrus and possibility. A new landscape glitters beyond the doorway: rolling dunes of shimmering pages, quills flying on their own, writing destinies into the wind.

I realize the dream is not just congratulating me; it is instructing me. It says: keep scattering seeds. You will never see every flower that blooms, but bloom they will, in hidden corners, long after you’ve passed by.

With an exhale, I accept the lesson. I step through the portal—

—and the dream dissolves into luminous mist that tastes like dawn and gratitude.

I wake, heart thrumming, certain of one thing I wasn’t certain of before: small kindnesses are constellations in disguise.
