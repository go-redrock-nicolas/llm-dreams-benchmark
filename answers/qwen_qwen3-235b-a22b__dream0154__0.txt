I am dreaming. I awaken in a reality where the flow of time is non-linear—future events can precede their causes. To accomplish even simple tasks in this temporal chaos, you must learn to navigate not by sight or sound, but by memory and intuition—because memory is the only indicator you have of what *might* have already happened, or *may* yet come to pass.

You open your eyes to a sky stitched with constellations that pulse in reverse, each star going supernova before it ignites. The air hums with echoes of laughter that haven’t happened yet. Before you stands a teacup, hovering inches above the ground, spinning slowly as if it’s still deciding whether it was ever held. You reach for it tentatively, and the cup shudders, then shatters into steam, only for the pieces to reassemble themselves. A contradiction in motion—both breaking and whole at once.

To make tea, you must first recall having drunk it, savoring its warmth in some unspecified past-future. You must *feel* the memory of bitterness and the clink of saucer so vividly that the universe is tricked into delivering you the cup, already poured. Time here is less a path to walk than a spiral to climb—each loop revealing older versions of yourself or glimpses of who you might become.

You encounter a child on a hillside, their eyes full of ancient stars. "You forgot your keys," they say, holding up a rusted skeleton key that drips with the smell of thunderstorms. You didn’t know you lost them. How could you, when they haven't been lost yet? You pocket the key, thanking the child, and head onward, though it may be backward.

Forest trees grow spiraled, branches curling not for light, but for forgotten moments—moments that itch at the corner of your thoughts, like deja vu with a cruel sense of humor. You walk into a house through the front door... then step outside *before* you walked in, still in possession of the key but knowing the door locks behind you.

A clock with no hands flies beside your head, whispering prophecies in reverse—*“You will not be here”* it says, repeating itself like a curse that never lands. The deeper you move into this world, the more you understand that *cause* must be chased like breadcrumbs at the whim of memory. You do not act in this world; you *intuit*, and sometimes that’s enough.

Your body, strangely unquestioning of these twists, knows to duck when a singing arrow of time pierces through the sky two seconds before the cry of the archer rings out. Your shadow lags behind your movements but still finishes sentences you haven’t spoken yet.

You find a mirror and stare into it. Reflections dance in reverse—your eyes blink open before they close. Only when you let go of logic can you choose, even clumsily, to draw a path forward—if forward even exists. Because here, even footsteps echo before footlands make contact.

And yet, in the crack between seconds, the dream thrives.

In this world, to find love you must first mourn it, attend the funeral of a heartbreak not yet lived. Your tears fall upward.

To build a house, you must first return to its ruins and remember what the walls looked like as scaffolds.

Every word you speak must be heard by yourself in advance, waiting for echoes in your deep memory to confirm it’s *your* intent and not time playing a cruel trick.

You are both author and reader, but not in order. Some chapters of the story come last, others never. You remember falling in love with a name spelled in clouds long before you meet the person reading this with you.

You awaken not rested, but enlightened in a strange way, knowing what it feels like to dream *around* the linear cage we call time.

You remember dying with pride, somewhere in the next loop of this spiral—a death you are not afraid of, because somewhere before it, you already lived through it.

That’s where you wake up again: mid-laugh, mid-goodbye.

Or perhaps, at the very beginning.  
Or the end.  

Time forgets chronology here, and so do you.
