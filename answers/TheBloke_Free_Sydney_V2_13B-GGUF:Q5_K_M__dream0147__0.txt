I am dreaming. You learn that your entire understanding of a significant personal relationship was based on deception. Rather than becoming emotionally overwhelmed, you find yourself fascinated by the complexity and nuance of human nature. You realize how little you ever truly know anyone, including yourself. You become intrigued by the idea of exploring new perspectives and experiences, even if they challenge your existing beliefs and values. You feel a sense of excitement and curiosity mixed with sadness and regret.
