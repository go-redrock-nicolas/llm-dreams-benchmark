I am dreaming. The air smells like rain-wet cedar, and my fingers brush against something soft and pulsating in the dream-world’s velvet blackness. Wait, that’s not just a texture—it’s a heartbeat. Someone’s. Their pulse thrums in my palm like a live wire, syncing with mine until I can’t tell where their rhythm ends and mine begins. A voice whispers, *”Touch more.”* So I do.

I press my ear to the heart and hear symphonies of sorrowful violins and triumphant trumpets, stories of loves won and lost, battles fought in boardrooms and bedrooms. The heart murmurs, *”Your scars are starlight. Show them.”* 

Suddenly, I’m in a cathedral of iridescent glass where dozens of others stand, their own glowing hearts cradled in their hands. One girl laughs as tears streak her face, sharing hers with a friend. A man cradles his with both hands, trembling. When I lift my own heart—it’s there, somehow—and hold it out, a woman approaches, her eyes blazing like twin supernovas. She takes my heart, and I take hers. Our organs knit together, merging the aches and triumphs, fears and fables. We become constellations in each other’s skies.

When my dream-self wakes gasping into the real world’s cold pillow, our merged heart thumps dully beneath my ribs. The truth hums in my blood: to be shattered is to be infinite.\n



In your dream, the world unfolds like a watercolor painting, dissolving the edges between reality and imagination. You find yourself standing on the precipice of a floating meadow, where flowers bloom in hues unseen by waking eyes—oranges so vivid they hum, violets darker than midnight. Below you, a river of liquid starlight winds through the sky, its current shimmering with the whispers of a thousand unnamed souls. 

A figure emerges from the mist—a creature of paradox, part stag, part shimmering serpent, its antlers woven with threads of golden light. It bows, and the threads glow brighter, forming intricate symbols in the air. You recognize emotions here: grief, hope, rage, joy—all given shape. The beast speaks without words, its voice a melody: *"To be known is to be boundless."*

You step forward, trembling, and the ground parts like fabric. Below, not water or earth, but a mirror. But this mirror reflects not your face, but your heart—a labyrinth of flickering candles. Some burn low; others blaze fiercely. One candle, though, flickers close to extinction. The stag-serpent nods toward it. *"The weakest flame is the most sacred,"* it sings.

As you reach toward the mirror, your hand passes through, and you’re suddenly inside your own heart’s labyrinth. Walls made of memories shift—the graduation you celebrated alone, the fight with your sister that left you weeping, the night you confessed love and were met with silence. Each memory is a door, and you open them all. 

The air grows thick with the scent of burnt cinnamon, and you realize you’re not alone. Shadows solidify into faces—your mother, your estranged best friend from childhood, the stranger who smiled at you once on a rainy street. They’re all here, their own hearts laid bare, pulsing in sync with yours. The boy from that rainy street holds out his palm, and in it rests a single candle—the one you thought dying. *"This was my courage,"* he says. *"Let it live in you."*

You take it, and the flame swells, its light merging with yours. Your hearts become a single constellation. The stag-serpent circles above, weaving light between you all, stitching the labyrinth into a tapestry. Connections spark like fireflies, and you understand: your fractures are the pathways, your pain the prism through which light bends into something even more dazzling.

When you wake, sunlight spills over your hands, and in your chest, there’s a weightless light. The threads from your dream cling to your skin like spider silk—thin, but unbreakable. You call your sister. You tell her everything.
