I am dreaming. The dream begins with me transporting an important and valuable artefact buried in the sands of time. The item, nestled within a protective box, is concealing its true nature. I’m in a cavernous chamber with towering obsidian columns, the air thick with the scent of ancient history. Hovering over the proceedings are shadows with hollowed eyes and whispers tugging at my mind. Each word is a signal to giggling regret and exhaling the last gasps of sanity. 

The participants in the negotiation are shrouded in cloaks of deception, their public personas obscuring their true intentions. The shadows wisp over to each figure in turn, probing their vulnerabilities with an almost spectral cunning. A tension in the room grows as the layers of falsehood are peeled back, exposing alliances as brittle as glass. 

There’s a moment of revelation. The artefact I’ve transported, once revealed, shifts into a kaleidoscope of light and dark, shifting and morphing into a thousand possible futures. It’s the key to unlocking a door to the past and the future, or perhaps its destruction. The whispers grow louder, almost violent in their insistence. 

And then I wake up, the dream slipping away like sand in an hourglass, leaving only threads of its mystery hanging in my mind, tempting me to dive back into its enigmatic depths.
