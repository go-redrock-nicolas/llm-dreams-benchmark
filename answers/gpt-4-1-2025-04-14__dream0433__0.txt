I am dreaming.

The air is thick with the glow of shifting colors, each hue pulsing with a rhythm that echoes my own heartbeat. I drift through an endless cathedral built of overlapping mirrors, their edges melting seamlessly into billowing clouds of amethyst and silver. With every step, my own face multiplies—sometimes gentle, sometimes severe—reflected back at me in the ever-curving glass.

As I walk, figures appear: friends, strangers, shades from memory. Each one behaves with an intensity that draws my gaze. There’s a man tapping his fingers compulsively, anxious and impatient; a woman interrupting others, eager for attention; a child sulking in a corner, refusing to engage. With a jolt, I feel irritation—so sharp, so familiar. The tapping grates, the interruptions gnaw, the sulking weighs on my spirit.

It dawns on me with crystalline clarity: these disruptions echo qualities I press down in myself, those disowned fragments I tuck away from daylight’s scrutiny. The dream draws me closer. The mirror-walls shimmer and dissolve, transforming into a swirling mosaic that projects not just their forms, but the subtle ache of my own self-disapproval.

I realize I am critical because I recognize my own reflection in them; I recoil because I wish those traits didn’t exist in me. This awareness swirls around me, a warm current, softening my stance. I reach toward the tapping man—suddenly, my hand is his, restless and full of unmet need. I speak with the woman, feeling the tug for validation flutter in my own chest. I kneel by the child, recognizing a familiar ache to withdraw.

Light pours in, golden and forgiving. The cathedral reforms itself—a vast garden now, wild with blue irises and silver-leafed trees, where every mirror becomes a pond, every pond reflects not only my face, but countless faces. I see with profound gentleness that all these traits are human, all are permissible. Even the parts I wish to hide have a place in this garden, learning, growing, evolving.

In this vivid dream, self-acceptance blooms. The figures, once projections on fragile glass, now sit easily beside me, weaving crowns from the flowers, smiling as if they were old friends finally welcomed home.
