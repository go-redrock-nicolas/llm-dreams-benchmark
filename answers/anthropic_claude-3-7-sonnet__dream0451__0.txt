I am dreaming. # The Threshold of Whispers

I stand before an ornate door I don't recognize, my hand frozen inches from the knocker. Beyond the weathered oak, light spills through stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscope patterns across an unseen floor. Voices murmur and laughter bubbles from within—sounds of celebration and connection that should draw me forward, yet my feet feel rooted to the stone steps beneath me.

My chest tightens with each breath. Why this dread? I've checked my reflection a dozen times in the fountain across the garden path. I recognize faces through the windows—friends, colleagues, people who've smiled warmly at me before. Yet anxiety wraps around my thoughts like morning fog, distorting what I know to be true.

The door suddenly dissolves beneath my fingertips, and I'm inside without having decided to enter. The room shifts and breathes around me—walls expanding and contracting like lungs. Conversations flow like water, people mingling and separating in intricate dances. Someone calls my name, their voice echoing strangely as if traveling across vast distances.

I move forward, and with each step, the knot in my chest loosens. A drink appears in my hand—something amber and warm. Words begin flowing from me, stories I didn't know I carried. Laughter erupts, genuine and bright. The faces around me transform subtly, becoming more vivid, more present.

The ceiling above opens to reveal a night sky impossible in waking life—aurora colors dancing between stars arranged in unfamiliar constellations. I realize I'm exactly where I'm meant to be, the earlier dread now puzzling in its intensity.

"You always do this," whispers a voice beside me—myself, but different, wiser. "Fear the threshold, then thrive once crossed."

I wake with the lingering sense that the dream held a truth I've always known but repeatedly forget.
