I am dreaming. I am drifting through an endless, luminescent forest, where the leaves shimmer with an otherworldly blue light and the air sparkles with floating motes of golden dust. The silence is a living thing, humming with the silent wisdom of trees older than time itself. In this dreamscape, I come upon a grand, soaring archway made of twisted, silver roots, where a gathering has convened—figures cloaked in robes spun from constellations and the soft breath of dawn.

As I move closer, I see one among them—a familiar shape, yet shadowed at the edges—leaning over a pool of liquid crystal. With a whispered word, they transform the surface, distorting the truth reflected there for their own gain. The air thickens with the sense that they have just broken a sacred trust—a violation of honesty, the principle I cherish most under this dream-sky.

Instinct floods my heart—a mingling of outrage and sorrow. My dream-self feels as though their veins run not with blood, but with the silvery tears that drip from the aching boughs overhead.

I take a breath, drawing in the pure, electric air of the forest. My voice, when it comes, rings with resolute gentleness, echoing off the crystal leaves. I plead not with anger but with hope: that the figure will see the beauty in truth, the peace in transparency, the strength in being upright even when shadows tempt us differently.

Around us, the trees lean closer, their branches entwining to form a living judgment, silent but potent. And as I lay a hand upon the deceiver’s trembling shoulder, the forest itself seems to pulse in anticipation: will they feel remorse? Will they right the wrong?

Whether or not they do, I know in this dream that I have stood, unwavering, as the guardian of the light I hold most dearly. The forest glows brighter, and I, wrapped in the caress of its leaf-laced rays, awaken with the conviction to bring such steadfastness into the waking world.
