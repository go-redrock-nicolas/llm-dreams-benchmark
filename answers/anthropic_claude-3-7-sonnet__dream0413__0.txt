I am dreaming. I find myself in a sunlit library that stretches impossibly in all directions, where the bookshelves curve like waves and occasionally ripple as if made of liquid wood. My fingers trace the spines of ancient tomes as I walk, and I notice with startling clarity that I'm speaking softly to myself—but the cadence isn't mine. The gentle lilt, the thoughtful pauses, the way my hands gesture deliberately to emphasize points—these belong to my old professor, whose wisdom shaped my understanding of poetry and metaphysics.

I catch my reflection in a pool of light that has collected on the floor like quicksilver. My posture has transformed; I stand straighter, with the same contemplative tilt of the head she always had when considering a complex idea. When I speak again, addressing a spectral figure browsing nearby, I hear her characteristic phrase: "Consider the layers beneath..."

Becoming aware of this mimicry sends a shiver of recognition through me. The library around me responds—books breathing in and out, shelves bending toward me as if curious. I realize I've been unconsciously building myself in her image for years, adopting her perspective as a lens through which to view the world.

The revelation triggers a metamorphosis: the ceiling dissolves into a canopy of stars, and each star contains a face—everyone who has shaped me. I watch as their influences flow into me like rivers of light, and I understand that I am a constellation of borrowed gestures, inherited wisdoms, and echoed voices, yet somehow uniquely myself.

The library floor beneath me becomes transparent, revealing infinite depths of other libraries below—representing all the knowledge and identities I have yet to discover and incorporate.

I awaken with tears collecting in the corners of my eyes, still feeling the weight of cosmic understanding settling in my chest.
