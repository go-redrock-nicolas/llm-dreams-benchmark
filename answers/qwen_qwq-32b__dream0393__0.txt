I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, glowing forest, the trees shimmering with an inner light. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and something electric, like ozone before a storm. Before me, two paths diverge sharply. 

To my left, a well-trodden cobblestone path leads into the heart of the forest, lined with towering silver-barked trees that hum faintly when the wind passes through their leaves. But there’s an odd stillness here; no birdsong, no rustling underbrush, only the steady, lulling drone of the trees. 

To my right, a path of liquid starlight winds upward into jagged mountains whose peaks pierce an indigo sky streaked with auroras. The air here thrums with urgency, charged particles brushing against my skin like static. Tiny, fiery insects dart around my head, leaving trails of phosphorescent sparks. 

A voice echoes faintly in my mind—not from outside but from somewhere within the labyrinth of my own thoughts. It whispers: “One path remembers what you’ve built. The other… unbuilds you entirely.”
