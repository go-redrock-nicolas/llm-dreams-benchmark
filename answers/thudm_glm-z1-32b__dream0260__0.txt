I am dreaming.  After receiving devastating news, I feel my emotions threatening to overwhelm me in a situation where I must maintain composure.  To manage this internal storm, I dive deep into my imagination, diving into a kaleidoscopic labyrinth of my own creation—a place where memory and magic collide in swirling, liquid hues of cobalt and amber.  

The dream begins in a cavernous library submerged beneath an infinite turquoise ocean, its walls etched with floating constellations that shift like constellations on the ceiling of a cathedral.  Each book is bound in moss that pulses faintly with the bioluminescence of a thousand fireflies trapped in a midnight mist.  I climb a staircase of spiraling kelp, my footsteps causing the stairs to unfurl new branches that writhe like serpents before hardening into stone.  

At the apex, I find a door made of gossamer webbing strung with dewdrops that refract every color of the grieving heart. Behind it, a corridor twists and turns, walls lined with mirrors reflecting fractured versions of myself: one clutching a wilted bouquet of ghost orchids, another perched on a raven’s back, another submerged in a bath of stardust.  The air smells of saltwater and burnt cinnamon, a scent that both calms and stings.  

Deep in the maze, I stumble upon a garden of grief-stricken trees. Their roots grow into human hands grasping at the earth, knuckles bleached white.  From each bough drips a cascade of liquid mercury, which pools into mirrors reflecting the face of the one I’ve lost. I reach for a droplet, but my hand passes through it, leaving a wake of iridescent dust that settles into the shape of a broken key.  

In the heart of the dream, I confront a towering figure carved from storm clouds: a primal, faceless spirit made of unresolved sorrow.  Its voice is a thousand voices crying whispers of “why?”  But instead of fearing it, I channel the storm into my own hands. I open my sweater to reveal a chest cavity filled with swirling galaxies.  From my throat pours a melodic scream—not of pain, but of reclaiming—music that shatters the spirit’s form into a shower of opal shards.  Each shard becomes a flame that rekindles forgotten blessings: a child’s laughter echoing in a cave, the warmth of a stranger’s hand on my shoulder, the way rain tasted at dawn after a fire had raged.  

When I wake, the real-world news still haunts, but in my bones dwells the inkling of a truth: pain is not eternal—it is a chrysalis, and in my dream, I’ve glimpsed the butterfly.  My tears glisten like the mercury tears of that mirror-garden, but they no longer feel like a flood.  They are a tide, pulling out to reveal the rugged shore of resilience beneath what once felt like miles of dark water.
