I am dreaming. **I am dreaming.**  

The air is thick with the scent of smoldering parchment, and whispers coil around me like smoke. I stand at the center of an infinite hall, its walls lined with mirrors that distort my reflection—sometimes towering and godlike, other times small and trembling. In my hands, I clutch a creation born from my deepest marrow: a twisting, living sculpture of glass and shadow, throbbing with a heartbeat not my own. It is beautiful. It terrifies me.  

Then, they arrive.  

The critics materialize from the dark edges of the hall, their faces shifting—faceless one moment, then sharpening into the visages of strangers, loved ones, even my own. Their voices overlap, a crescendo of dissection:  

*"Too raw. Too revealing."*  
*"Did you really think this would be enough?"*  
*"We’ve seen this before—weak, derivative."*  

My creation fractures under their gaze, hairline cracks spreading like veins. I try to speak, but my voice is swallowed by the hall. One critic steps forward, their eyes black pools, and reaches into the sculpture, pulling out a strand of luminous thread—my shame, my hope, something I’d buried deep inside. They examine it, then let it slip through their fingers, dissolving into ash.  

Laughter rings out, jagged and cold. The mirrors shatter one by one, and I fall to my knees as my creation collapses into glistening shards—each piece reflecting not the critics, but *me*, endless iterations of my own doubt.  

And then—silence.  

A single shard remains, pulsing faintly. I reach for it, bleeding, and press it to my chest. Warmth spreads. The hall dissolves.  

I wake, gasping, clutching the echo of something *real*—something that was worth breaking for.  

The dream lingers. *I* linger.  

(And the next night, I will dream again.)
