I am dreaming. I stand at the central command station of the hospital, my feet planted firmly on quivering ground. The emergency room stretches out before me like a war zone, beds overflowing with moaning patients. Every breath echoes through the space, a cacophony of suffering. The orange glow of emergency lights bathes everything in a hellish hue.

Santina rushes up to me, sweat beading on her forehead, exhaustion etched in every line on her face. "Dr. Lewis, we're losing another one in Ward 3," she blurts out, words cracking with emotion. "We don't have any more defibrillators. There's nothing we can do!"

I feel a cold dread coursing through my veins as I glance around at the scene before me. Doctors and nurses scramble from patient to patient like ants, their scrubs stained with blood and other bodily fluids. Beeping monitors fill the air, their steady rhythm punctuated by the occasional flatline.

"We need to triage," I say, my decision firm despite the sickening feeling in my stomach. "Any non-life-threatening cases, move them to the hallways. We need every bed for critical patients." I spin to address the gathered staff. "Listen up, everyone! I want a full count of our remaining supplies now. And check for any additional equipment in the storage rooms!"

Through the windows, I can see an endless line of sirens approaching - more ambulances bringing more victims to our overtaxed facility. My phone buzzes incessantly with messages from other hospitals in the region, all facing similar crises.

As I race through the corridors, the walls seem to close in around me. My rational mind fights against the swelling panic. Focus. Prioritize. Save who I can. But with each step, my heart weighs heavier, knowing that impossible choices must be made.

"Dr. Lewis!" A nurse calls from a side room. "The pediatric ward is running out of oxygen!"

I sprint through the halls, dodging gurneys and scattering medical supplies. When I burst into the pediatric ward, the scene before me freezes my blood. Infants lay gasping in their cribs, oxygen tanks nearly empty. Their terrified parents hover nearby, pleading with their eyes for me to save their children.

Time stands still as I assess the remaining resources. The tanks meant for the adults could sustain the children's vital signs, but it would leave the grown patients without. The young lives versus the old lives - a decision no human should ever have to make.

I can hear Santina's voice in my mind, reminding me of the Hippocratic Oath I swore all those years ago. As I look into the desperate faces of the parents, I feel the crushing weight of responsibility settle upon me like a mountain, an unimaginable burden I must bear alone.

Can I truly play God here? Is there no other way? The questions swirl in my head as the precious seconds tick away, each one a countdown to irreversible tragedy.
