I am dreaming. I float through an ancient forest where the trees reach impossible heights, their bark spiraling with luminescent patterns that pulse with each breath I take. The air tastes like honey and distant storms, filling my lungs with warmth that spreads outward to my fingertips. Gravity seems negotiable here - sometimes I walk on paths of moss so soft it feels like childhood memories, other times I drift upward, swimming through dappled light that breaks through the canopy in tangible beams I can touch.

The forest opens to reveal a city built of crystalline structures that shouldn't stand but do, defying physics with their impossible angles. Buildings curve and flow like liquid, catching the light of three moons that hang low in a violet sky. Streets wind not just forward and back, left and right, but somehow in directions I can perceive but not name.

Inhabitants move about with purpose - some human-like, others beautifully alien with forms that shift like watercolors bleeding across wet paper. They speak in colors that I somehow understand, their emotions washing over me in waves of indigo contemplation and amber curiosity.

A bell tolls somewhere, its sound visible as ripples of golden light that spread through the air. With each ring, the world subtly transforms - architecture rearranges, pathways redirect, and I remember things that haven't happened yet while forgetting moments I'm currently experiencing.

Time folds in on itself like origami, and I realize I've been here before, will be here again, am always here in some corner of consciousness where dreams persist like echoes.
