I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a floating plaza suspended above an impossibly vast violet sky. The air ripples with electric violet sparks, and every surface—paving stones, railing, even my own skin—hums with a gentle, luminous vibration. I look down: miles of neon rivers swirl below, winding between towers like ribbons of liquid light. A soft, seductive melody drifts through the air, its notes shaped like drifting glass petals that brush past my cheeks.

Here, in this dream-reality, every boundary is porous. I sense a museum of forbidden relics a few strides away—a glass dome cradling shimmering artifacts that pulse with secret energy. I step through its translucent door without a thought for the guard I pass, whose uniform ripples uselessly around him as though he’s already forgotten why he stood there. A constellation of floating barriers hovers between me and an opalescent orb that throbs at the heart of the dome. I don’t ask permission: my fingers stretch through the barrier, parting it like water. It sighs and flows around my hand. I lift the orb without a final glance at the glass-eyed timekeeper behind me.

Clutching my prize, I stride out onto the main street. The cityscape morphs beneath my feet—the paving stones become living moss, then glass, then soft clouds that glow underfoot. A line of pedestrians forms. They murmur about courtesy, queueing, waiting their turn. I press forward, indifferent. My pulse syncs with the city’s heartbeat, each step erasing the polite expectations they hold. They part like fragile paper screens, and I slip past them, smiling at their disbelief.

Suddenly, the neon rivers below surge upward, flooding the plaza in a cascade of electric light. I leap from platform to platform—stone slabs that tilt and spin in mid-air—and the world tilts with me. I shatter through a panel of living glass, sending crystalline shards showering like stardust. The shards don’t cut; they melt into liquid color on my skin, painting my arms in ribbons of deep indigo and molten gold.

The city’s melody crescendos into a single, resonant chord that thrums through my bones. It’s as if every social rule—every “please,” every “thank you,” every polite hesitation—has dissolved into pure energy. In that moment, I am both the dreamer and the dream: unstoppable, unbound, perfectly in tune with the pulsing heart of this impossible place.

And then, as I raise my arms to embrace the flood of color and sound, I wake—my pulse still echoing with the memory of what it feels like to slip through boundaries that once seemed immovable, to take what I want without hesitation, and to exist purely in the electric freedom of my own dreams.
