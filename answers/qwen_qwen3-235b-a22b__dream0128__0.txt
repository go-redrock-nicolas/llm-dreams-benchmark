I am dreaming. And through the shimmering veil of slumber, I am transported to a dimension where time stretches like warm taffy and thoughts flicker in neon hues of electric violet and incandescent gold.  I am myself, and yet I am not. I am the diplomat, the linguist, the somnambulist cartographer of the mind—forging maps through labyrinths of sound, syntax, and sign.

The air here smells of parchment, ozone, and the faintest whiff of blueberry pie—somehow, impossibly comforting amidst the storm of cognition raging in my head.  Around me—inside me, perhaps—the dream world shapes itself into seven rooms, each glowing a different color, each a portal into a new tongue.  Crimson for Mandarin. Emerald for Arabic. Sapphire for Russian. Topaz for Spanish. Rose-Quartz for French. Amber for Japanese. And a strange, prismatic color that does not exist in waking life—it pulses and flickers—for Láadan, the experimental feminist language that I've challenged myself to master.

I stand at the center of this surreal chakra, seven tongues twisting on my lips. Every heartbeat is a conjugation table. Each breath, a new vocabulary set. I speak and stammer and blend words like paint, fumbling the nasal vowels of Portuguese while wrestling the clicks and clucks of Xhosa in my throat. Sweat beads like nervous ink upon my temples.

A clock towers above me—if one can call it that—its gears shaped like tongues and its numerals written in kanji and cuneiform. Time is running out. The mission is approaching.

In the distance, a nameless ship hauntingly built of whalebone and starlight looms across an obsidian sea. That’s where I must go soon—armored in fluency, guided by grace. The mission isn’t just about language treaties and geopolitical boundaries; it’s a negotiation with the Dream Realms themselves, with entities not quite human, not quite divine, who speak only in ancient dialects entwined with the roots of the universe.

I continue studying.

A sentient scroll named Zithra slithers across the floor of my mind, whispering Old Norse runes into my subconscious while a talking hummingbird in rose-tinted spectacles quizzes me on French subjunctive tenses. Somewhere behind me, a choir sings the Hungarian declensions of “I love,” while robotic kangaroos punch conjugated verbs in Korean on brass typewriters.

The dream pulses. It fiercely demands focus. Fragments of sentences orbit my skull like satellites—some dissolving in my neurons, others colliding with sparks of comprehension. My body twitches with the foreign rhythm of unfamiliar cadences.

Then, like a lightning bolt strung from dream-thread, I understand.

Words are keys, and the universe is a door. And I—a drowsy diplomat armed with seven vocabularies, a stubborn heartbeat, and the quiet fire of purpose—I am its keymaster.

I rise. I descend. I step onto the obsidian shore.

And behind me, the seven glowing tongues hum softly, like sleeping gods: ready to awaken when needed.
