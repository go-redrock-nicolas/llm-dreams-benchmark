I am dreaming. ———————- vivid dream using the deepest parts of your imagination. ———————-

Golden light spills into the port’s cobblestone alleys, where the sundrenched pansies perched along warm planters softly nod in the afternoon breeze. The harbor is a harmony of hues --- sapphire ripples shimmer with the reflections of hopping seadragonettes against a sky kissed by crimson clouds that shifted with the mood of the wind, silent but insistent, whispering tales from faraway lands. A convoy of yonderworld carriages line the notched boardwalk, hauled by featherback huls, each with a bronze-and-crimson crest tucked behind a mantle of violet lace. The convoy is led by an orange pekin in the front, his yellow eyes glistening with the majesty of the dawn.

Aboard the deck, you can hear the haughty laugh of the mast captain, his voice heaving with a familiar malaise and aged amber rum, trickling with the cadence of soft laughter as he recounts a story, shaking the harp-shaped medallions on his epaulettes under the breeze. Yet. unknown to all but a few, his jovial nature is but a mask, and here we find him handwringing, brooding at the starboard wheel as he stands between the twin masts of a ship named "The Sallow Petrel." The captain’s mind sways with the weight of the current, with every roll of the waves a reminder that the great prize he seeks may be beyond his grasp.

There’s a commotion down deck, where the shiphands are preparing the evening’s repast. There is laughter, a sharp note of it dangling from his mouth as he steers the ship toward Longmire’s Tooth, a flat-tipped jut of land scarred by a thousand and one years of battles, of burning lights that have lit the sky and scorched the neighboring city. Crouched in a corner, a deckhand named Ren is carving a whistle from the hewn timber of the fallen mast, his fingers calloused and skilled. The whistle's song will mimic the call of a wild valleyhawk, a rare bird said to bring luck to sailors. Ren, he dreams of the valleyhawk, of the seeds it will sow in his soul. A soft smile on the deckhand's lips, one he hasn’t worn since his daughter’s last letter came from across the seas, a beacon of hope in a world that has grown so dark.

Below deck, however, there’s a specter haunting the team --- the ship’s navigator is absent. The captain has plans to meet the specter tonight, his voice shaking as he declares that the ship will not sail without its artifice, without the navigator’s guile and wit. Yet he fears, in the pit of his heart, that the navigator has gone off with the merchant prince of the Feast of Embers, a rare creature indeed, who in opulent caravanserais from the shores of the Crimson Coast to the Bay of Eternal Mists has been known to peddle in not just goods but in the dreams and souls of men.

You see, the captain harbors a soft spot for the navigator, a man who once saved his life from the churning seas and whispered storms and who is feared lost in the tendrils of the merchant prince's charm. The captain’s face grows dark as he broods over the horizon, the beat of his heart echoing the waves churning beneath the ship.

Dreamily, you hear a splash in the water, something too quiet for the ship’s sailors to notice. Could it be the navigator, slipping away? Or is it something more sinister lurking beneath? Your mind tugs at the thread of the dream, weaving the ship’s fate into a fabric all its own. You feel the weight of the dream pressing down on your mind, forcing you awake with a gasp. You sit bolt upright, straining your ears for a sound that isn’t there, your heart thundering in your chest. Yet, when you look out onto the darkened waters of the bay, nothing stirs. A specter of a dream, lingering just beyond the veil of sleep.
