I am dreaming. At first, the world around me is a blur—soft-edged and indistinct, like ink bleeding through damp parchment. Then, slowly, the haze dissolves, and I find myself standing in a twilight meadow, where the air hums with the scent of crushed wildflowers and the distant murmur of a hidden stream. The sky is a tapestry of indigo and violet, streaked with the last molten gold of a retreating sun. 

In this half-light, odd details begin to seize my attention. A single dewdrop clinging to a blade of grass fills me with a rush of inexplicable satisfaction. The hushed rustle of a rabbit darting through the underbrush sends a thrill through my veins, as though I have just uncovered some grand secret. I pluck a pebble from the damp earth—smooth and cool—and cradle it in my palm, marveling at its simple weight. Just holding it feels like a triumph. 

Memories of a past self surface—someone who once sought vast, roaring victories, who craved fireworks and fanfare. Now, in this dream, the smallest things unravel a quiet euphoria inside me: the flicker of a firefly, the way the wind knots my hair in delicate tangles, the warmth of a patch of sunlight that lingers on my skin like a touch. 

I look up and realize the once-distant stream is now beside me, whispering over polished stones. Kneeling, I press my fingertips to the water, and the ripples radiate outward in perfect concentric circles. *This,* I think, *this is enough.* The realization is a revelation. 

The dream swells with the weight of this new understanding—that joy does not always roar; sometimes, it trickles, quiet and persistent, like the stream before me. It seeps into the cracks of my being, until even the smallest wonders feel like riches. 

And as the dream begins to fade, the meadow dissolving back into the void, I clutch the pebble tighter, knowing that when I wake, the memory of its weight will stay with me—proof that even the simplest things can leave the deepest marks. 

Then—nothing. Only the slow return to consciousness, the echo of the dream clinging like the fragrance of rain on warm earth.
