I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it’s cold—bitingly, impossibly cold—and the sky above you is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, swirling and hissing as if alive. You stand in a throne room carved from a single block of obsidian, its walls etched with constellations that bleed starlight. The floor is a mirror of polished ice, reflecting not your face, but a thousand versions of yourself: a child clutching a toy scepter, a warrior with a rusted crown, a shadow with no features at all. At the room’s center looms a chair forged from frozen lightning, its arcs crackling like trapped souls.  

A voice, neither male nor female, reverberates through your bones: *“You are chosen. The Unlikely Sovereign. The Unwritten King.”*  

Before you can speak, they arrive.  

Your subordinates. Veterans of a thousand wars, their armor stitched with the threads of dead empires. Their eyes glow the color of smoldering coals, and their faces are masks of disdain. One, a woman with a blade forged from black glass, steps forward. Her voice is a serrated whisper. *“You? A pretender. A flicker in the dark. We serve legacy, not luck.”*  

The others murmur, a chorus of scorn. You feel their hatred like a physical weight, pressing your spine into a question mark. But the throne hums, its energy seeping into your marrow, whispering secrets in a language you don’t know yet understand: *“They fear what they cannot name. Name yourself, and the world will bend.”*  

You stumble forward, your boots cracking the ice floor into fractals. The woman with the black blade raises her weapon, but time dilates. The arc of her strike slows to a crawl, and in that suspended moment, you see it—the faintest thread of silver light connecting her wrist to the heart of a dying star, pulsing faintly in the void beyond the ceiling. All of them are tethered. Threads of light, frayed and flickering, binding each subordinate to some forgotten truth.  

You reach out, not with your hands, but with a thought sharpened by the throne’s hunger. The threads tremble. The woman’s blade freezes mid-strike, then twists in her grip, pointing not at you, but at her own throat. Gasps ripple through the room.  

*“You think authority is earned,”* you say, though your lips don’t move. The words bloom in the air like smoke, visible and venomous. *“But power is a wound. And I have bled more than you know.”*  

The threads snap, one by one, and where they break, the subordinates falter. The woman with the black blade sinks to her knees, her glow dimming to ash. The others follow, their defiance crumbling like parched leaves. Yet in their submission, you feel no triumph—only the hollow ache of a hollow crown.  

Outside, the mercury sky boils, and a storm of glass shards begins to fall. The throne demands action. A realm to command, chaos to quell. You raise a hand, and the storm obeys—not because you understand, but because you dare. The shards swirl into a bridge, arcing into the horizon where a city of floating islands drifts, half-ruined, half-alive. Your city now.  

But as you turn to lead, the mirror-ice floor ripples. Your reflection grins back—a version of you with hollow eyes and a crown of thorns. It mouths a single word: *“Remember.”*  

You wake with the taste of static on your tongue and the echo of a scream that might have been your own.
