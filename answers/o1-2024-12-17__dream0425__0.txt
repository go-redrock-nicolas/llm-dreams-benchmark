I am dreaming. You find yourself adrift in a dreamscape that shifts and ripples like the surface of a moonlit lake. The horizon arcs around you in an endless circle of bruised twilight, neither day nor night, with stars that sparkle like fragments of distant sapphires. The air feels thick and humming with an unspoken promise, as though all the secrets of your soul are just about to reveal themselves.

You notice a floating pathway made of translucent tiles before you. Each tile glimmers beneath your feet and pulses with an inner light that resonates in your bones. Every step sends soft ripples through the air, as if this dream place responds to your presence like a living being. Despite the kaleidoscopic beauty around you, a hollow ache flutters in the pit of your stomach—a longing for a purpose that no worldly success seems to fill.

As you venture further, the translucent tiles begin to drift apart, leading you toward a vast, circular plaza made of prismatic crystal. In its center stands a colossal tree whose trunk is black as obsidian yet refracts light like a diamond. Its branches twist and curl upward, a thousand shimmering leaves reflecting hidden galaxies. The air around the tree buzzes with energy, tinged with the scent of sage and honey.

At the base of this magnificent tree, you sense currents of your own memories—both triumphant and painful—swirling around its roots like ghostly rivers. Faces float by: old friends, mentors, even strangers whose passing words shaped your journey. Their eyes meet yours in silent recognition. You realize with a pang that all these shards of memory have led you to this exact moment, standing before a tree that radiates an unearthly, nurturing power.

Yet that ache in your chest intensifies, urging you to lean in, to press your palm against the tree’s rough bark. The second your hand touches the trunk, a jolt of warmth rushes through your body. It’s as if your deepest worries and unspoken fears are siphoned into the tree, spreading through its branches in webs of glowing emerald. The leaves begin to vibrate—first softly, then with increasing force—causing beams of emerald light to cascade from every limb.

In a burst of shimmering radiance, the tree’s branches seem to peel apart, revealing a hidden hollow that beckons you inside. Stepping closer, you find yourself moving through the tree’s heart, a tunnel lined with swirling colors and ancient sigils carved into the wood. The pulsating amber glow deep within these carvings reminds you of the ways people measure success, as though each glowing symbol represents some accolade or milestone you’ve achieved. And yet, you feel no fulfillment from these faint echoes of past victories.

Emerging from the other side of the trunk, you stand atop a cliff bathed in sunrise. Soft pastel clouds swirl below, and the distant horizon is ablaze with pink and golden light. A sea of rolling hills spreads out before you, blanketed in dew-kissed wildflowers that wave at you like a friendly greeting. Each bloom has an uncanny sparkle, as if they’re alive with singing energy. The wind carries their gentle voices—soft, inviting, effortlessly harmonious.

Suddenly, you feel a presence beside you. Turning, you see a figure made of light—an ethereal reflection of yourself. Its features are blurred, and yet you recognize the shape of your face, the tilt of your head. The figure looks at you with compassionate eyes that speak volumes: it knows your restless yearning for meaning. It knows how you’ve chased validation, accolade after accolade, only to wake up with that nameless emptiness lodged deep within.

Silently, the luminescent figure points toward the sun on the horizon—a sun blazing with multi-hued fire, as though alive in its own swirling cosmos. The figure’s touch on your shoulder is tinged with empathy, urging you to let go of your fears. In that moment, time seems to stretch, and you feel a resonant phrase echo in your mind: “The longing itself is the meaning.”

You watch, fascinated and serene, as the sunrise flares brighter, washing over the cliffs, the fields of singing flowers, and the entire sky in a radiance so tender that your heart feels fit to burst. Everything dissolves into a single, throbbing note—like the triumphant final chord of a cosmic symphony.

And then…and then you awaken, your heart still pulsing with the profound glow of that dream. The sense of emptiness is different now—no longer a hollow ache, but more of a doorway. A mystery that calls you to keep exploring, to keep asking, to keep living. And behind it all, you sense the faint echo of that melodic sunrise and feel, perhaps for the first time, that your searching, longing spirit is where true meaning begins.
