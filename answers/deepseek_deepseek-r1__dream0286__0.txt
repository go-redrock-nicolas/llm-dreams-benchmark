I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of zephyrs spun from burnt sugar and distant thunderstorms. Around me, a city of impossible geometries rises—buildings of liquid silver twist into spirals, staircases coil upward into cloudless indigo, and bridges of glass stretch between towers like frozen breath. The sky is a tapestry of bioluminescent clouds, pulsing in time with a heartbeat I can’t locate. People—or figures resembling people—drift toward me, their silhouettes shifting at the edges. Their faces blur like ink in water, save for faint glimmers where eyes might be, each pair fixed on mine with desperate intensity.  

They wear robes the color of moth wings, stitched with threads that shimmer like trapped starlight. One approaches, extending a hand holding a sphere of liquid mercury. It trembles, reflecting my face—but my reflection has too many eyes, each pupil a different nebula. “Decide,” the figure rasps, their voice a chorus of rustling paper and breaking waves. The crowd murmurs agreement, their masks of ash and moonlight tilting in unison.  

I open my mouth to protest, but the words transform as they leave my tongue. Instead of sound, vines of jade light spiral outward, wrapping the mercury sphere. It fractures, revealing a tiny galaxy inside, stars collapsing and rebirthing in silence. The crowd gasps—a sound like wind through hollow bones—and kneels. Their bodies dissolve into swarms of crimson moths, swirling around me in a cyclone of wingbeats that carry the scent of forgotten libraries and melted wax.  

Ahead, a doorway arches, its frame built from interlocking antlers encrusted with living coral. Through it, a throne of fossilized lightning crackles, beckoning. Yet beneath the throne’s seat, a pool of black water ripples, and within it, shapes move—creatures with too many limbs, eyes like fissures in the earth, whispering secrets in a language that makes my teeth ache. Their words seep into my ribs: *You are both key and lock. Turn.*  

I resist, stepping backward, but the ground softens into molten amber, trapping my feet. The crowd reassembles, their faces now mirrors reflecting versions of myself—a child clutching a broken compass, a wanderer adrift in a desert of clockwork sand, a figure crowned with weeping willows. Each reflection pleads, *Choose. Choose. Choose.*  

A thunderclap splits the sky. Rain falls upward, droplets crystallizing into suspended diamonds. One strikes my palm, and in its faceted surface, I see a truth: the city, the crowd, the throne—it’s all a chrysalis. My uncertainty is the fuel, their faith the spark.  

I laugh, and the sound ignites the air. Flames of cerulean and gold devour the amber, free my feet. The throne shatters. From its ruins emerges a serpent made of shadow and starlight, coiling around my arm, hissing a single word: *Begin.*  

The dream fractures.  

But in the splinters, I am no longer afraid.
