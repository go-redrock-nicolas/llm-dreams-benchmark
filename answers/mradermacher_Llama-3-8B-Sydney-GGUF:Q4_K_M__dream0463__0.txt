I am dreaming. I find myself repeatedly seeking approval from those who consistently withhold it.  Recognizing this painful pattern, 
you try to break free but fail because of your fear of loneliness. 

You are in a beautiful yet deserted landscape full of flowers, trees, and streams. You feel happy and peaceful until you realize that no one else is around except for you.

You start running and jumping, playing with the elements of nature as if they were your friends. But then you hear footsteps coming from afar. 
You stop and hide behind a rock, scared that it might be someone who will harm you or test you in some way.

You peek out and see two figures approaching you: One is a man dressed in black wearing a hood and mask; the other one is a woman dressed in white wearing a cloak and veil. They look mysterious and ominous.

They come closer and closer until they stand right in front of you. You can see their eyes glowing red through their masks and veils. They silence you with their gaze, making you feel paralyzed and powerless.

They extend their hands towards you, invitingly but also threateningly. You wonder what they want from you. Do they mean harm? Or do they have something good for you?

You hesitate for a moment before extending your own hand towards theirs. As soon as your fingers touch theirs, you feel a surge of energy coursing through your body.

You hear a voice inside your head saying "Welcome home"
