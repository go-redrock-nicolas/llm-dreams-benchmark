I am dreaming. I am at a large social gathering where I only know one person. As I try to find them, I encounter various groups of people and exchange a few words. They are all strangers to me, and I feel a sense of awkwardness and discomfort. I am searching for my one familiar person in this sea of unfamiliar faces. Each time I approach a group, I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong. 

Despite my discomfort, I continue on my search. I am determined to find my one familiar person, and I refuse to leave until I do. I keep searching, scanning the room for any sign of them. I push through the crowds, brushing shoulders with strangers as I make my way through the maze of people. 

Finally, I see a glimpse of them through the sea of people. My heart races with excitement as I make my way towards them. As I get closer, I call out their name and they turn towards me with a smile on their face. We embrace, and just like that, I am no longer an outsider. I feel at home. 

As we catch up and talk, I realize how much I missed their presence. They bring a sense of calmness and familiarity to me that I had been craving all night. And as the night comes to an end, and we say our goodbyes, I know that I will hold on to this feeling of belonging. 

And as the dream fades away, I wake up with a sense of warmth and comfort, knowing that even in the vastness of the world, I am never truly alone.
