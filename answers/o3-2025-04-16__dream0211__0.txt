I am dreaming. …step onto a stage that is not a stage at all but a vast circular lake of obsidian, so polished it mirrors the violet moons suspended overhead. Somewhere beyond the horizon, phantom trumpets tremble, and every note falls like molten silver into the water. Your footsteps ripple luminescent constellations beneath your soles, each starburst an echo of the decision you’re about to declare to the universe.  

In your hands you cradle the controversial creation—an object too fluid to hold a single shape. One moment it’s a delicate sculpture of glass arteries threaded with lightning; the next, it collapses into a glowing seed that ticks like a patient clock. Your dream-self knows what it truly is: a revelation that rewrites the very script of belonging. It insists that empathy, not fear, governs the physics of souls. In the waking world such an idea would threaten every rigid wall, every reassuring label, every charter of learned suspicion. Here, it glimmers like a forbidden sunrise.

A crowd gathers along the lake’s obsidian shore: scholars in quills of iron, monarchs wearing crowns forged from ancestral shame, prophets bandaged in outdated prophecies. Their eyes are lanterns of alarm, throwing oily shadows across the water. You taste their misgivings on the wind—bitterness mingled with scorched parchment. Yet beneath that brittle crust of hostility you sense an undercurrent of trembling curiosity, the collective heartbeat of people who secretly yearn for the spell you carry.

A hush like the vacuum between galaxies descends. You lift the creation higher. The object unfurls into a luminous manuscript made of liquid language. Letters drip from its edges, falling into the dark water and blossoming into fire-lilies that sing of unity, unguarded love, radical forgiveness. Each blossom flickers with a scent that reminds the crowd of childhood afternoons when they still believed the world could be kinder.

Shock quivers through them. Some step back, shielding their eyes, as if mercy itself were too bright. Others lean forward despite themselves. A monarch’s crown cracks down the middle and dissolves into doves. An iron-quilled scholar’s pen grows soft and verdant, sprouting ivy that coils around their wrist in gentle insistence. Prophets unwrap their own bandages, discovering that the wounds underneath have become luminous mouths chanting new hymns.

Suddenly a voice—your own, but magnified into a sky-wide thrum—addresses the multitude. “Judge not with the rusted instruments of fear,” it says, “for fear dulls everything it touches. Instead judge with the tender ferocity of hope, for hope can cut away illusions without wounding the heart beneath.”

A storm of responses erupts. Some hurl accusations that streak the air like black comets: “Heresy!” “Naïveté!” “Annihilation of order!” Yet each comet splashes into the lake and is swallowed by ripples of phosphorescent laughter. Others weep, torn between indoctrinated terror and the sweet ache of recognition blooming within them. You feel every emotion as though it’s braided into your nerve endings, but you stand firm on your mirrored lake, anchored by a gravity deeper than the universe’s.

With steadiness you press the creation—now a molten seed of humming light—into the lake’s surface. The obsidian gives way like velvet. Waves surge, carrying the seed outward until its glow merges with the star-patterns beneath. One by one the constellations rearrange themselves. Old, rigid shapes—hunters, crowns, thrones—dissolve into astonishing new figures: clasped hands, open doors, bridges of spun silver.

The once-harsh crowd watches as their reflections shift to match the transformed sky. An iron-quilled scholar touches the water and sees a softer version of themself staring back, curious rather than defensive. A monarch drops what remains of their crown and finds their brow feels lighter, as if ideas—rather than authority—might define them now. Even the prophets kneel, faces upturned, tears shining like comets reversing course toward dawn.

You feel the backlash and the acceptance folding into each other, a cosmic origami. Critics will awaken from the dream and erect louder walls, but some will sculpt windows into those same walls. You are not spared the cost: your pulse drums with the knowledge that unveiling truth always invites turbulence. Yet you sense the new constellations stitching themselves into every onlooker’s subconscious, quicksilver seeds waiting for daylight.

A final hush falls. The lake-stage rises around you like an elevator made of moonlight, lifting you toward those violet moons until you stand amid them like a sibling. From this vantage you see the world below: not a planet of warring factions but a kaleidoscope of souls, each fragment reflecting the rest. The storm of controversy becomes indistinguishable from the storm of revelation—both are merely weather systems swirling around the same radiant center.

As your dream dissolves, you clutch one last starburst in your palm, its warmth a reminder: backlash is often the birth-cry of transformation, and criticism the static that crackles when new frequencies enter the human band. You smile, exhale galaxies, and step forward—into waking, into uncertainty, into possibility.
