I am dreaming. It's not every day you find yourself in a dream, but here you are. The world around you is soft and surreal, like walking through a watercolor painting. You're standing in a vast, open field, and the grass beneath your feet is impossibly green, stretching endlessly toward a horizon painted with pastel hues of orange and pink. Above, the sky is alive with swirling clouds that shift and dance like wisps of smoke.

In the distance, there’s a structure—something between a pavilion and a grand treehouse, built with impossibly smooth wood and draped with vines that shimmer like liquid gold in the dream-light. A path of stepping stones, each glowing faintly, leads you toward it.

As you approach, the air hums with a melody you can't quite place, yet it feels deeply familiar. The pavilion seems to call you, and before you know it, you're stepping inside. The space is warm, filled with a soft glow from floating orbs of light. Around you are figures, people you know and some you don't. They're whispering, their voices blending into the ethereal hum.

At the center, someone stands. They're holding a gleaming object—a trophy, perhaps, or a symbol of accomplishment. You recognize them instantly: it's someone you’ve worked with, someone who took the credit for a project you poured your heart into. Their smile is wide, their eyes bright with pride.

The crowd cheers, clapping loudly, and the sound reverberates through the dreamscape like thunder. Yet, you don’t feel anger. Instead, there’s a strange mix of emotions swirling inside you—like watching a storm from afar, ominous but distant. You watch them bask in the applause, and it feels like you’re detached, observing the scene through a foggy lens.

But then, something shifts. The scene around you begins to distort. The figures in the crowd blur, their faces morphing into indistinct shapes. The pavilion itself begins to crumble, pieces of it dissolving into the air like sand slipping through fingers. The cheers grow louder, almost mocking, and the sense of unease builds.

Suddenly, you're back in the field, alone. The sky darkens, and the once-vivid colors of the grass and trees fade into monochrome. The dream feels heavy now, the air thick and oppressive. A whisper cuts through the silence:

“What does it mean to be seen?”

You turn, searching for the source of the voice, but there’s no one there. The field stretches endlessly, and you’re left standing in the quiet, grappling with the weight of recognition—both the presence and absence of it.

You wake up, the feeling lingering like a shadow, a question left unanswered in the light of day.
