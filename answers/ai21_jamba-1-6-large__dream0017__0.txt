I am dreaming. I receive devastating news that would upset most people. Instead of breaking down, I take a deep breath and 
ramifications ripple through my bones like the shockwave of an explosion. The silence that follows is not a void but a tension, sharp and electrifying. My pulse slows, not out of calm, but out of practiced control.

In the aftermath, I rise—not with defiance, but with an eerie grace. Shoulders squared, I turn away from the chaos, not because I am unaffected, but because I am hyper-aware. Every glittering fragment of the moment—the angle of light through a shattered window, the scent of ozone in the air—becomes a tool, a weapon, an anchor to steady myself against the storm.

I lace my fingers together, cracking knuckles with deliberate slowness, as though every joint is a lock being released. I speak, and my voice cuts through the commotion with the clarity of a bell: This is not the end.
