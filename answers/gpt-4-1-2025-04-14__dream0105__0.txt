I am dreaming. find yourself seated cross-legged on an intricately woven rug, whose deep crimson and sun-bleached gold threads form geometric shapes that seem to shift under your touch. The air around you is thick with the scent of cardamom and rose, a fragrance you’ve never encountered, blooming from a steaming cup of sweetened tea trembling in your unfamiliar hands.

All around you, everything is unfamiliar. Grandparents sit silently in the corners of the room, their faces etched with the stories of a thousand dawns, eyes twinkling like embers in a hearth. Their clothing is a dazzling riot of color—indigo silks, saffron shawls, elaborate headdresses—each thread layered with centuries of meaning you cannot grasp. Laughter erupts easily among cousins whose language flows like water; every syllable seems both a song and a secret. You catch only fragments, words that flutter and dissolve before you can reach for their meaning.

Someone gestures for you to join them at the low table, placing a dish before you—golden, spiral-shaped pastries drizzled with translucent honey, grains of pistachio glowing green atop their glistening curves. You falter, uncertain whether to use your right or left hand, whether to accept with a bow or a nod. Your hesitation brings a ripple of good-natured laughter, and a gentle hand guides yours, showing you how to break the bread, how to dip it into the thick yogurt, how to eat with careful respect for the ritual of the meal.

Music begins—an ancient melody from an instrument that is neither harp nor violin; its strings cry and call, echoing in the dome of the ceiling where painted birds sweep in flight. You are invited to join the circle as they dance, their steps a sequence of delicate footfalls and wild, spinning turns. At first your movements are out of rhythm, shaped only by the clumsiness of your uncertainty, but warm hands steady you, and you begin to find the pulse that draws everyone together—a tide that lifts, spins, and carries even you.

The dream shifts. You wander through corridors painted with elaborate murals: fierce tigers leaping over mountains, rivers winding to distant cities, lovers running beneath moons as wide as your longing. Every surface begs to tell its story, every face you see holds a puzzle, every whispered word a lesson. You are lost, but gently, sweetly lost—the not-knowing becoming an adventure, the unfamiliar morphing into possibility.

Somewhere among the dim corridors, you find yourself in a small room filled with amber light and shelves crowded with ancient books. A grandmother smiles at you, and though you still have no words, you understand her as she passes you a thin, battered storybook. On its first page, she points to a picture of a child who looks almost like you, and you realize: this is your first lesson—not in language, but in belonging. And as the music swells somewhere behind the walls, you begin to believe, just for a moment, that you always had a place here, that you are not just a visitor in this dream, but a cherished new note in the song of this family’s centuries-long melody.
