I am dreaming. I am standing on a hill overlooking a valley that stretches into a sky filled with stars that swirl like glitter trapped in a snow globe. The air smells like burnt vanilla and old books. My presses into moss that glows faintly underfoot. A figure approaches—translucent, shimmering in hues of amethyst and cerulean. It speaks without moving its lips: "You’ve unlocked the Seventh Symphony of the Forgotten." I’m confused. I haven’t composed any symphony. The figure gestures to the valley below where the stars are now swirling in a pattern that forms sheet music. Notes pulse like constellations. I realize the symphony is my life’s journey—the struggles, the forgottenkindnesses, the silentperseverance. The validation washes over me, warm and grounding. A cascade of colors erupts as if the sky applauds.
