I am dreaming. The air feels thick with perfume and conversation as I navigate through a sprawling Victorian mansion, its high ceilings adorned with crystalline chandeliers that seem to pulse with their own heartbeat. The party guests around me wear faces that somehow shift and blur when I try to focus on them directly, like watercolors running down a canvas.

I'm searching for the one familiar face in this sea of strangers, but each room I enter morphs into something more surreal than the last. A parlor filled with people in masquerade masks suddenly has walls that breathe like lungs, their velvet wallpaper expanding and contracting. The guests laugh in harmonies that sound like wind chimes made of bone.

As I pass through doorways, they shrink and grow like something from Alice's Wonderland. I catch glimpses of my reflection in gilded mirrors, but my image seems to linger for a moment after I've walked away. The crowds part and reform like schools of fish, their conversations becoming a symphony of whispers that almost - but not quite - make sense.

In one room, the guests are all drinking from cups that never empty, the liquid inside changing color with each sip - from deep crimson to midnight blue to molten gold. Their laughter echoes too long, bouncing off the walls until it becomes music.

I keep thinking I see my friend just ahead - a familiar silhouette, the edge of a remembered smile - but when I reach out, they dissolve into clusters of butterflies that scatter through the air, their wings leaving trails of phosphorescent light.

The harder I search, the more the mansion seems to expand, sprouting new corridors and spiral staircases that lead to impossible places. Some guests now float inches above the floor, while others cast shadows that move independently of their owners. Time feels elastic, stretching and compressing like taffy.

And all the while, there's this growing sense that something momentous is about to happen, some grand revelation waiting just around the next corner, in the next room, behind the next door...
