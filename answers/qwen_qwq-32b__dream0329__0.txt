I am dreaming. I am in a place made of glass. The walls around me shift colors, like a kaleidoscope, but they’re also transparent. I can see vast, starry skies above me, but I feel trapped because I’m enclosed in this translucent structure. Suddenly, a figure appears outside the glass. It looks like a person made of liquid metal, shimmering and ever-changing. They gesture for me to follow, but there’s a path blocked by a wall of ice. The metal figure touches the ice, and part of it melts to reveal a glowing red door. A voice in my head whispers that the door leads to freedom, but warnings flash in my mind—breaking protocol. I have to decide whether to step through.
