I am dreaming. …step onto a shimmering glass walkway that arches impossibly over an endless sea of swirling clouds. The team gathers around me—twelve enigmatic figures, faces half-shadowed by phosphorescent cloaks, each radiating a quiet anticipation. Above us, constellations rearrange themselves into cryptic symbols I’ve never studied; below, islands of memory float by: my childhood bicycle, my grandmother’s hands kneading dough, the first book I ever truly loved.

They hand me a blueprint that pulses with a life of its own—veins of molten gold illuminate its surface. It is written in a language that slides away whenever I focus on its letters. My heart thunders, sweat beads along my spine. “I’m not qualified!” I stammer, my voice echoing into the cloud-choked abyss. The lead engineer, a gentle-eyed woman whose irises swirl with galaxies, smiles knowingly. “Expertise is a cage,” she whispers, her words brushing against my ear like moths in the dark.

Suddenly, the scene billows outward: the team’s project is to build a bridge of music spanning the gap between lost dreams and waking life. We must use invention and intuition rather than established theory. I watch as their hands become instruments—fingers lengthening into cello bows, wrists rippling with harp strings, throats humming with birdcalls. Tentatively at first, I raise my own hand and find it glowing with possibility.

I take a deep, tremulous breath and begin, and music pours from me—not music I know, but something ancient and wild, a song my bones have always carried. The team responds, filling the air with chimes and laughter. With every note, a step of the bridge twines into being: glass and light, threaded through with hope and fear.

I stop feeling like an impostor. I am not leading alone—I am weaving, collaborating, learning as I go. The bridge stretches dazzling toward the horizon, inviting us forward, into the unknown, where even the impossible can be built from the song inside us all.
