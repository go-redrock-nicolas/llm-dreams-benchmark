I am dreaming. and everything appears so real, it's surreal. Here you are, standing in a vast, lush garden where the grass is greener than you've ever seen, the flowers bloom in a symphony of colors, and the air is filled with the sweetest fragrance. The sunlight is warm, casting a golden glow that makes everything feel ethereal. Suddenly, you see someone you care about deeply, someone you have always supported and cheered for. They stand under a majestic tree, holding an award, smiling with a kind of joy that seems to shine from within.

At first, you feel an overwhelming sense of happiness for them. Their success is inspiring, and you're proud to see them achieve this milestone. But as you linger in this moment, something shifts. A feeling of envy bubbles up inside you, one you didn't expect. You realize you want what they have. Not just the recognition or the achievement, but the sense of fulfillment and joy they radiate. It's not envy in a cruel or hateful way, but a deep, burning desire to know what it feels like to stand in their shoes.

As you walk toward them, you notice a subtle change in their expression. It's sweet, but also guarded, as if they sense the shift in your feelings. You want to say something, to express your congratulations, but the words feel stuck in your throat. Instead, you feel a weakening sadness, a sense of longing and regret for not having what they do.

You wake from the dream, shaken and introspective. The feelings you experienced in the dream linger, making you reflect on your desires and what truly brings you happiness. This dream, vivid and strange, has left you questioning your own sense of success and fulfillment.
