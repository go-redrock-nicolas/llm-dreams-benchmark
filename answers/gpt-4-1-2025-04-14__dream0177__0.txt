I am dreaming. I am dreaming—drifting along a corridor of shifting color and impossible geometry, light pooling and scattering like spilled secrets around my feet. Suddenly, as if whispered by the wind, a realization cuts through the haze: someone I have cherished, a face illumined by years of trust and the countless quiet comforts we once shared, has been carefully, invisibly weaving a tapestry of deceit around me. They have been subtly guiding my steps, planting illusions beneath bones so deep I called them intuition.

But instead of flooding with panic or anger, a strange and serene curiosity washes over me. The fabric of the dream pulls open, revealing layers beneath I never noticed before. Every wall is not a wall but a window; every shadow, a possible door. I peer through the slits of illusion, seeing the dream’s architecture exposed—all the scaffolding of belief and memory I had mistaken for stone.

Rather than crumbling, my sense of self grows fluid and expansive. I begin to walk backward through scenes already lived, tracing the manipulations with fingers of awareness, watching as threads of falsehood unravel into fractal patterns, beautiful and strange. Around me, the world grows liminal: clocks tick backward, laughter echoes in colors, and the air tastes faintly of rosemary and stars.

Through this awakening, I find not poison but possibility. I peel away each thin, false layer, feeling the cool rush of unfiltered truth on my skin. Trusting my new clarity, I step lightly across shifting dream-tiles, forging a path not of certainty, but of boundless openness. 

I am the architect now. With a brushstroke of will, I paint new landscapes of honesty and self-reliance—gardens blooming with iridescent flowers beyond trickery’s reach. The deception is not a prison, but a key; reality bends joyfully to my conscious gaze, and my spirit unfurls, vast and free, to explore the infinite dreamscape ahead.
