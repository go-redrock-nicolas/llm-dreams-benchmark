I am dreaming. …slam your palm down on the holographic drafting table and every line of the blueprint pulses crimson.  

“Stop.”  
The single syllable ripples across the half-finished platform like a shockwave, freezing welders mid-spark and survey drones mid-air. Sparks hang motionless, tiny suns between breaths. Even the wind that circles the colossal shaft below seems to hush, as though the planet itself is waiting to hear what you will say next.

You step forward onto a catwalk of transparent graphene, the abyss yawning miles beneath your boots. Somewhere down there, magma tides groan like sleeping leviathans. The structure—an orbital elevator anchor that will one day carry harvest ships and families—rises above you in concentric chandeliers of silver. It looks impossibly fragile, as if a careless whistle could shatter it.

Your team stares. Their exosuits glow with status lights: amber for fatigue, red for error. You can practically taste the tension—a metallic tang like blood on copper.

“We don’t round numbers,” you say, magnifying a measurement on the suspended schematic. A single diagonal beam is off by 2.4 millimeters. “That sliver can shear cables, buckle trusses, tear lives in half.”

Someone mutters, “It’s within tolerance.”  
You flick your wrist; the offending beam magnifies until it fills the sky. The dream obliges, turning the surface into a canyon of riveted metal so vast that clouds drift through its struts. High above, a phantom elevator car appears, gliding along a ribbon-thin rail. The car shakes, stutters—then plunges. 

All at once the dream accelerates: steel screams, cables snap like harp strings, and the falling car bursts into a million translucent shards that swirl around you in slow motion. Each shard contains a reflection—children clutching lunch boxes, miners singing on their commute, a medic reading poetry—to remind everyone who rides on these numbers.

The shards swirl back together, reversing time, the car restored. But the lesson hangs in the charged air.

“You will fix it,” you command softly, “and you will measure again.”

To emphasize the point, you tap the air. A symphony of soft chimes erupts as laser levels, smart calipers, and molecular printers power up. Light beams trace perfect lattices around the errant truss, knitting it into alignment with sub-micron grace. As every correction clicks into place, the elevator anchor glows—first ember-red, then dawn-gold, then a radiant blue that feels like forgiveness.

Your crew moves as one organism now, guided by the unspoken rhythm of absolute precision. Each heartbeat becomes a metronome. Each breath, a calibration. The heavens above open, revealing a spill of neon auroras that form a colossal ruler stretching from one horizon to the other: the universe itself measuring your resolve.

When the last weld cools, silence falls—deep, reverent, complete. The air tastes of ozone and relieved adrenaline. You inhale, and the structure seems to inhale with you, as though it has become an extension of your body, your certainty, your vigilance.

Then—because dreams must pivot—you glance down and see that the abyss has filled with water clear as molten glass, reflecting the newborn superstructure like a second sky. Schools of silver-scaled fish drift in the depths, their tails flicking precise angles. Even nature has accepted the math.

You almost smile.  

“Wake me when the tolerances drift,” you whisper, and the dream folds itself neatly, like an origami crane of light, waiting for the next moment someone thinks of cutting corners again.
