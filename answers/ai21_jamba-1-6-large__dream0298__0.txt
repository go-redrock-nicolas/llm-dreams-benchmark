I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, serene lake, its waters reflecting the soft blush of a tranquil sunrise. The world around me feels like a watercolor painting, bathed in gentle pastels. There is a profound silence, broken only by the occasional chirping of distant birds. 

As I stand there, I realize I’m holding something in my hand—a small, smooth pebble, cool to the touch. I remember why I’m here. 

This lake is a place of reflection, but not just of the sky and trees. It’s where I confront my mistakes, my fears, my regret. For as long as I can remember, I’ve visited this lake in my dreams, drawn to its quiet wisdom. 

I crouch down, ready to toss the pebble into the water, to watch the ripples distort the world reflected there. But something stops me. 

A voice. 

It doesn’t speak in words, but it feels like my voice, only softer. Kinder. 

You don’t have to throw it away. 

It’s small but firm, like a hand resting gently on my shoulder. This act of forgiveness for myself, this act of allowing imperfection—it was alien, yet I felt it so deeply. 

I close my hand around the pebble. Holding it, I feel its smooth edges, the way it fits perfectly into my palm. I bring it closer, and it warms beneath my touch. 

The lake remains calm, but something in it shifts. The ripples begin to form on their own, reaching outward in slow, deliberate circles. 

I watch them, mesmerized, realizing the truth in that moment. They came from within the lake itself, born from the deep waters, not from the pebble I almost threw. 

I smile, and I don’t know why, but it feels like I’ve been holding my breath forever, and I can finally exhale. 

I turn, no longer afraid to carry the pebble with me. 

The dream shifts. 

I am at home, sitting on the edge of my bed, holding the pebble again. It’s the same weight, the same coolness. 

And then I notice a glimmer at its center. Slowly, carefully, I open my palm. 

In the heart of the stone, faint but unmistakable, I see a shimmering light. Silvery threads stretch and pulse in a rhythm all their own—a tiny, perfect galaxy. 

This was mine, it whispers. All along. 

And suddenly, I know that every dream needs a light.
