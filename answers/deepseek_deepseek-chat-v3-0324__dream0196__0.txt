I am dreaming. The theater is colossal, a gilded labyrinth of velvet and shadows, where chandeliers drip molten gold onto an endless sea of faces below. The air hums with anticipation, thick as syrup, pressing against my skin. I stand in the wings, heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird, as a stagehand thrusts a polished violin into my hands—the instrument of a maestro I’ve never met, whose name hangs in the air like a forbidden spell.  

Music sheets flutter in front of me, whispering in a language I don’t understand—notes spiraling into impossible constellations, demanding fingers that can bend time, limbs that can breathe sound. The conductor, a figure of smoke and starlight, turns to me with hollow eyes and raises his baton. The audience quiets. A single spotlight ignites.  

My hands are not my own. They move with eerie precision, my bow gliding across the strings in a dance I’ve never learned. The violin sings—no, *screams*—a sound so alive it splits the air, shimmering between agony and ecstasy. The melody is not just heard; it *lifts* the audience, their faces flickering with rapture, tears carving silver paths down their cheeks.  

And yet—I am not playing. Something else is. My fingers blister, my muscles scream, but the music *plays me*, surging from some abyssal well beneath the stage. The theater walls dissolve, revealing a night sky throbbing with constellations that sway to the rhythm. The conductor’s grin stretches unnaturally, his baton now a scythe, carving the air into jagged, living sound.  

The final note shatters the chandeliers. Glass rains like crystallized time. The audience doesn’t clap—they *dissolve*, one by one, into the stardust now swirling in the spotlight’s beam. The violin crumbles to ash in my hands.  

I wake with the phantom weight of strings still etched into my fingers, the echo of a song I cannot name howling silently in my chest.  

And for a moment—just one—I miss the stage.
