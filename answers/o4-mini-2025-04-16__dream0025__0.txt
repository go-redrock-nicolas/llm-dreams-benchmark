I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a vast marble hall whose ceiling dissolves into a star-speckled sky. Pillars carved from pearlescent coral stretch infinitely upward, each one pulsing with the heartbeat of your ambition. You feel the hush of centuries in the air, as if every whisper you ever uttered has been gathered into this moment. Your hands are clasped so tightly your knuckles glow white, and in your chest your own heart has begun drumming a triumphant cadence.

Before you, a long obsidian table holds the verdict of your years—the final report, bound in silken white leaves that flutter like trapped butterflies. At the far end of the table, three guardians await: one is an owl with eyes of molten amber, one a stoic fox whose tail shimmers with starlight, and one a tall, elegant woman whose silhouette ripples like heat haze. They regard you in complete silence. Every breath you take echoes in your ears like a cathedral chord.

As you step forward, the leaves of the report rustle and lift, arranging themselves into words of gold. They hover just beyond your reach, quivering with possibility. The air around you ripples; colors shift from indigo to emerald, then to a brilliant sunrise orange. You stretch out your hand—and suddenly the world tilts. The marble floor liquefies, and you’re floating in an ocean of light, each wave singing a note of victory or defeat. You can taste salt and hope on your lips.

Then the pages snap open. Golden letters swirl upward, forming the single word you’ve spent years chasing. Time slows to a crawl; your heart freezes in anticipation. The owl blinks once. The fox’s tail sways. The woman lifts a crystal chalice filled with liquid starlight. You feel the drumbeat in your chest pound harder, louder. And as the final letter completes itself in midair, the entire hall—and you with it—erupt in a revelation so bright it feels like being born again. You know, beyond any shadow of doubt, that you have succeeded. The light spills over you, warm and electrifying, and you wake, your eyelids fluttering with the echo of triumph.
