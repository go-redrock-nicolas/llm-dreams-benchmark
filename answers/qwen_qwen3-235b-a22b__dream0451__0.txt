I am dreaming. A soft, misty dream—like walking through a barely-remembered memory padlocked in time. The sky above is a deep lapis blue with a tinge of lavender, that shade that emerges just before true twilight swallows the world. I’m standing barefoot on a marble floor that’s cool and smooth but pulses faintly, as though the stone breathes. In the distance, there’s laughter—warm and low, like the humming of a familiar lullaby—but it doesn’t comfort me. It unsettles me.

I dread the event. There’s no question of *why* right now—I simply know it in the marrow of my bones. A grand ball is being hosted in this dream-place, somewhere beneath the shimmering surface of the twilight sky and above the spiraling abyss of a curious ocean I see reflected in puddles which aren’t puddles at all. This gathering is spinning forward like time itself rushing to an inevitable deadline. I can feel its pull, the way the threads of fate weave me toward it, and the thought tightens around my chest like an invisible corset.

I forget the rules here. Who to talk to. The customs, the masks I must wear. The dream world is fluid but layered tightly in its own arcane complexity, and I’ve never entirely mastered its etiquette. My anxiety coils and writhes. It’s metaphysical in this place—a black fog creeping along my spine. It isn’t just typical pre-occasion nerves; it’s deeper, visceral. There are shadows inside this emotion—glimmers of something hidden. Uncomfortable truths brushing against the inner recesses of my mind like soft fingertips on velvet.

I walk—gliding, really—to an arched mirror standing alone in a vaulted corridor with no walls. As I approach it, my reflection isn’t mine. It’s familiar but twisted, smudged like wet charcoal. In this mirror stands someone I once feared becoming: a frail, shapeless figure draped in borrowed confidence, eyes haunted. I recoil, instinctively, but I force myself to lean closer. Behind me, the sound of laughter grows louder, more jocular, but I feel completely detached.

Why is this dread so consuming? The event seems trivial in the grand dream-narrative. Superficial: people dancing, smiling, existing in shared delight. I know how these nights unfold—games of laughter pooling in amber, temporary friendships forged in the fire of casual alcohol-fueled confessions, then drifting back to solitude like autumn leaves settling after a brief gust. Still, my dread clings to me, a living parasite I cannot shake.

I close my eyes and press my hands to the mirror’s surface. Chill pours through my palms, dripping into my veins. When I open them again, the dream shifts. I’m not staring at myself anymore—I’m staring at unfamiliar worlds, fragmented like shattered shards. Each reflection is a memory—or perhaps *was*. One shows me as a child at a party dressed as something monstrous. Another shows me failing to speak, tongue glued to silence by a crowd’s collective gaze. Then another, deeper: a memory that I never lived yet recognizes me as part of its depth. A memory of being truly alone, despite everyone around.

I push back. This dream isn’t simply about a party—it’s about confronting pain disguised beneath civility. About wearing masks in waking-life as often as I do here. My anxiety, sharp and vibrant, reveals fractures in the facade of normalcy I’ve built for myself. This gathering will feel like performance, not connection. People smiling but saying nothing; music loud but lifeless. I can already envision myself standing at the edge while others dance, my palms sweating and thoughts racing with nonsense phrases—*what if they see me... what if they don’t?*

The whispers of the dream morph into truths. The relentless party isn't the source of my anxiety; it’s what the gathering forces me to confront—the uncomfortable mirrors I’ll face there, the people who know me slightly but remind me too much of myself entirely. 

The music grows louder. The marble floor trembles. Twisting and swirling, the abyss-puddles swirl like galaxies. In this vivid dream, dread mingled with curiosity hangs in the air—but threaded within it is something else. A tiny ember of courage. A shimmer of understanding. Perhaps the act of going, even if I hate it, is part of braving life in all its shimmering, terrifying depth.

I lean back from the mirror. The frame begs me to stay longer, but something deeper within me tugs forward toward the gathering, toward the agony and ecstasy we call connection. I drift forward once again—but now with eyes unblinded, heart more prepared to wade into the shimmering haze of humanity beneath the lunar-blue canopy.

You see, even in dreams, we confront the truths we won’t face fully in daylight.
