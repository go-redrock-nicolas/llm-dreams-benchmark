I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers and shifts as if suspended in liquid amber, every surface reflecting a warm, golden glow that seems to pulse with a slow, hypnotic rhythm. I stand in the center of an ancient library with no ceiling, its towering bookshelves stretching into a sky of swirling violet and indigo. The books themselves are alive—their spines ripple with colors like the scales of tropical fish, and they whisper in languages both familiar and eerily unknown.  

A great mirror appears before me, framed by gnarled roots dotted with tiny glowing mushrooms. My reflection isn't static—it flickers through time, showing me as a child laughing in the sun, as a young adult trembling with uncertainty, as who I am now, steadier but still searching. Then, something remarkable happens: the mirror melts into liquid silver, pooling at my feet before rising again into the shape of a door.  

Beyond it stretches a path of floating stones, each one pulsing with a memory. As I step onto them, they react—some grow warm, others hum with forgotten melodies, and a few turn translucent, revealing scenes from my past that I had viewed one way for years, but now see anew. A moment of heartache once dark and consuming now glows softly with the lessons it carried. A triumph that once seemed so grand now feels smaller, yet richer in its true purpose.  

A voice, deep and resonant, echoes not in my ears but in my bones: *"To see again is to know the river has carried you."*  

And then—I feel wings. Not on my back, but within me, like some long-dormant part has unfolded. The path dissolves, and I am soaring over emerald valleys where time flows in spirals, where laughter and tears from years past rise like mist to greet me.  

Just as I begin to understand, dawn breaks in brilliant gold—and I wake, not with a start, but with the quiet certainty that the past is never really behind us. It moves through us, shifting like light through a prism, revealing new colors each time we dare to look again.
