I am dreaming. You open your eyes— or perhaps you invent them— inside a sky that has forgotten it is supposed to be above anything. It folds itself into metallic ribbons, curling around your ankles like affectionate smoke, while the ground ripples overhead in slow-motion avalanches. Gravity thuds, releases, reverses, then yawns sideways, as if it were only half awake and stretching in bed. You take a breath flavored with thunder and honeysuckle, unsure whether lungs are strictly necessary here.

First priority: stay anchored to something that might pass for “down.” You reach for the nearest object, but it’s a staircase made of letters, each step a consonant you can actually feel— crisp, like lightly toasted bread. The staircase floats vertically, shrugging at the very concept of Newton. You grab a capital R; its curve bends obligingly around your wrist, and for a moment the universe tolerates your weight. 

Time then slips its gears. Noon erupts, but the sun looks bashful and retreats, leaving dawn smeared across the horizon like wet paint. Your memories scroll backward: you’ve already seen the future where you solved this problem, so logically—if logic counts for anything—you have solved it now. You close your eyes, siphon that borrowed recollection, and find a small brass device in your palm: a chronal compass. Its needle doesn’t point north; it points toward the next stable second. You press it to your chest, and suddenly moments snap into focus like a sequence of pearls on a string—fragile, yet briefly ordered.

Water: you need it. A river drifts past overhead, translucent as blown glass. When gravity inverts, droplets break free and plummet upward, tinkling like wind chimes. Remembering a trick from a half-remembered tomorrow, you whistle in the key of E-flat. Sound here has opinions; it curls around the droplets, convinces them to hover. You cup your hands and the water decides to flow downward for you, cool and effervescent, humming with small harmonies of fish that never evolved beyond melody.

Hunger arrives next, disguised as a question mark that flutters in front of your face. Catch it, unfold it, and it becomes a cookbook written in scents. The page on “Sustenance When Physics Misbehaves” suggests coaxing bread from eclipse-light. You wait until the sky blinks; when day and night overlap in a charcoal halo, you slice a wedge out of the darkness with the edge of your shadow. The slice browns at the crust and steams with cinnamon. You taste it, and nostalgia floods your tongue—memories of breakfasts you never had but always wanted.

Causality now throws a tantrum. Effects bloom before their causes. You watch your footprint evaporate a moment before your boot touches the sand-like air. To keep cause and effect in the correct order—at least locally—you spin your chronal compass thrice. Threads of probability gather round you like a cloak, hemming reality into a rough compliance. The world grumbles but obeys, letting you finish the step.

Night decides to arrive inside your pockets first: tiny galaxies swirl where lint should be. You need shelter. You whistle again—E-flat, faithful note—and command the stray punctuation staircase to unfurl. It unspools into an arching hull the size of a small cottage. Letters reorganize themselves: WALL, ROOF, DOOR glow briefly before fading to plain cedar boards, nailed together with commas. You step inside, and the interior stabilizes time to a gentle heartbeat. Stars revolve leisurely outside the window, sometimes clockwise, sometimes nostalgic.

Exhaustion approaches like slow rain falling upward. You anchor yourself by telling a story out loud—stories appear to have mass here, and recounting one pins you to your pillow. You narrate how you will wake tomorrow to find gravity in a cooperative mood, how time will untwist long enough for breakfast, how causality will remember its manners just for a sunrise. The words crystallize, forming a lattice around your bed; they hum lullabies in dialects made of color.

As your eyelids drift closed, the chronal compass ticks, satisfied. Somewhere beyond the walls, the laws of nature play chess with dice, arguing softly about whose turn it is to contradict themselves. You smile, already dreaming a fresh contingency plan, and surrender to the lull—floating, falling, rising all at once—cradled by a universe that refuses to sit still, yet, for the moment, lets you rest.
