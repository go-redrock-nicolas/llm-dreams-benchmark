I am dreaming.

At first, I am blinded by the harsh fluorescent lights of the doctor’s office, the sterile tang of antiseptic sharp in my nose, the words diagnosis, terminal, months to live echoing through my skull with all the cold finality of winter rain on stone. Panic skitters, tiny electric shocks racing under my skin. The world fuzzes around the edges, reality buckling like a thin sheet of glass under too much pressure.

I stumble out of the clinic into the thick bloom of late summer, air humming with cicada song, the sidewalk shimmering in the heat. A wild urge pulses inside me—what now, with so little sand left in the hourglass? The knowledge bites deep, but strangely, the fear begins to unravel, replaced by clarity, as if someone has wiped clean a fogged window.

I walk, aimless at first, but drawn toward the city’s heart—winding through crowded streets ablaze with neon signs, hidden gardens spilling over old brick walls, the mysterious undercurrent of life flowing all around me. Every sensation is painted in sharper hues: the bitter zing of espresso at a noisy café, the laughter dancing up from a group of street musicians, the weightless relief of letting a stray cat nuzzle against my ankle.

As dusk liquefies the sky into streaks of violet and liquid gold, I crest a hill overlooking the city. The rooftops unfurl like a map of infinite possibility: places I have never been, people I have yet to meet, secrets waiting behind every illuminated window. I realize my life—shrinking though it might be—is not a closing door but an invitation, flung wide in the face of time’s merciless advance.

Resolved, I whisper my regrets and wishes to the sapphire twilight. I vow to fill the months with as many vivid moments as they will hold: to stand in the ocean under a rainstorm, to trace forgotten constellations, to say what I have only dared to feel. Each breath tastes more precious—bright, bittersweet, and achingly alive.

In this dream, my spirit is both trembling and expansive, a spark in the gathering dark, hungry for every last drop of wonder.
