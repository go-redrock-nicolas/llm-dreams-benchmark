I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and crushed violets, the kind of smell that clings to the back of your throat like whispered secrets. Above me, a night sky swirls—not with stars, but with thousands of fluttering origami cranes, their paper wings catching an unseen wind, glowing softly as though lit from within.  

I am standing in a labyrinth of mirrors, but they do not reflect me—not as I am. Instead, the glass holds versions of myself from other lives: a shadowy figure in a rain-soaked coat, a child with kaleidoscope eyes, an old woman weaving threads of silver light between her fingers. Each reflection mouths words I cannot hear, lips moving in urgent silence.  

Beneath my feet, the ground shifts—not sand, not soil, but pages of an unfinished book, the words dissolving as I step on them. A silver thread, impossibly thin, tugs at my wrist, pulling me forward. I follow, running my fingers along the cold glass walls, leaving smudges of cobalt-blue ink behind.  

Then—a sound. A deep, resonant hum, like a cello string plucked underwater. The mirrors ripple as if made of liquid, and for a heartbeat, I see through them. Beyond the glass is a vast, luminous ocean where schools of fish dart in perfect synchrony, forming symbols—an hourglass, an open door, a key.  

A voice, not mine but somehow familiar, whispers: *"You are the bridge between the seen and the unseen. The story is waiting."*  

I reach out—and the dream fractures into a thousand shards of light.  

I wake with the taste of salt on my lips and the unshakable sense that something vital has been etched into my bones.
