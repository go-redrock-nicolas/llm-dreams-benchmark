I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a city that breathes. Buildings pulse with gentle illumination—copper-gold and azure—their surfaces rippling like the flanks of sleeping beasts. The sky above isn't simply dark but a tapestry of impossible depth, where stars form constellations that slowly rearrange themselves into glyphs I almost understand.

Before me lies a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with tiles that change color beneath my feet—responding to my thoughts rather than my weight. Each intersection branches into seven directions, not the expected four. Street signs display words written in a script that transforms as I read them, the meanings slipping into my mind sideways, like memories of conversations I've never had.

A woman approaches, her silhouette constantly shifting—sometimes tall and willowy, sometimes compact and powerful—but her eyes remain fixed points of amber light. She hands me a box made of interlocking wooden pieces that reconfigure themselves beneath my fingers.

"The solution isn't in what you see," she tells me, "but in what you forget to notice."

The box unfolds into a three-dimensional map of the city, but certain streets are missing. I realize with dream-logic clarity that the absences themselves form a pattern—the negative space is the message.

Rain begins to fall, each drop containing tiny scenes from lives I might have lived. As they splash against my skin, I absorb fragments of knowledge. The city's rhythm synchronizes with my heartbeat. The buildings are not structures but vessels, the streets not paths but equations, the people not individuals but composite facets of a singular consciousness.

I understand now. The challenge isn't external but internal—the connections were always there, waiting for me to recognize that separation itself is the illusion.

The city folds inward, the woman smiles as she dissolves into motes of light, and I awaken—though still dreaming—with the solution humming in my blood, ineffable yet complete.
