I am dreaming. you're sentenced to death by a group of warriors from another clan. They plan to kill you during their next raid on your settlement. The night before the raid, they gather around a fire and sing a powerful song that puts them in a trance-like state where they can fight without fear or pain. You overhear this song and realize it contains hidden instructions for killing you. If you don't escape tonight or find someone who believes you, you will die tomorrow.

You have to act now!
