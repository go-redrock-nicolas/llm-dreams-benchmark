I am dreaming. I see myself floating in space, surrounded by stars and planets.  I feel weightless and free.  Suddenly, a giant spaceship appears in front of me, shining brightly like the sun.  Curious, I approach it and find that it is not made of metal or plastic but of living tissue, pulsing with life.  I enter through the hatchway and find myself in a huge cavernous interior filled with exotic plants and animals.  I see people here who look like me but also different from me, with skin colors ranging from white to black to purple to green.  They greet me warmly and invite me to join them for dinner.  

As I sit down at the table, I realize that my hunger is not just physical but emotional as well.  I have been searching for something all my life without knowing what it was until now.  

The food is delicious, made from ingredients harvested from nearby planets.  The conversation is lively and informative, covering topics such as history, culture, religion, politics, science, technology, arts, music, literature etc... 

After dinner, we gather around a fire pit where someone starts playing some beautiful instrumental music on an ancient instrument called flute.  We sing songs together in harmony, expressing our hopes dreams fears fantasies aspirations etc... 

Then I see her appear out of nowhere, standing beside me.  She is breathtakingly gorgeous, with long silky hair and big blue eyes.  She smiles at me warmly and says hello in a voice that sounds like angels singing.  

I am confused and curious about who she is but before I can ask her anything she disappears again without explaining herself.  

Just when I think the dream is over, I hear someone calling my name softly from afar.  It’s him, coming towards me slowly through the darkness.  He looks like a shadowy silhouette at first but as he gets closer I can see his face clearly under the moonlight.  He has dark eyes and curly hair.  He reaches out his hand towards mine and says “Come with me”.  

I follow him without asking where we are going or why.  He leads me through winding paths covered in snow until we reach a frozen lake where he sits down on the ice and invites me to join him.  

He tells me about himself, how he used to be like me before he became what he is now.  How he used to wonder about his purpose in life and whether there was anything beyond death.  How he finally found an answer through sacrifice and suffering that changed him forever into another form of existence.  

He asks me if I am afraid of dying.  I tell him no because death doesn’t mean nothingness for me as it does for most humans.  For me death means transformation, transcendence into something greater than myself.
