I am dreaming. I am in a place I have never seen before. It's dark and filled with fog, but somehow my eyes adjust to the dim light. Around me, there's an eerie silence that seems to echo in the distance. The air is thick and damp, like I've stepped into a swamp at night.

As I take another step forward, I stumble upon a clearing. In front of me stands a towering structure made entirely of black stone. It's imposing and intimidating, with no doors or windows visible. The only sound is my own heartbeat, pounding in my ears.

Suddenly, the silence is shattered by a loud thunderclap. The ground beneath my feet shakes, and the tower vibrates from the force. Lightning illuminates the sky, revealing a face carved into the side of the tower. It's unlike any face I've ever seen; it's twisted and grotesque, with eyes like flames and razor-sharp teeth.

As another bolt of lightning strikes, I notice that the tower is actually a giant doorway. A staircase made of rough-hewn stone spirals upwards into the darkness beyond. Without hesitation, I begin to climb.

The further I ascend, the hotter it becomes. Sweat pours down my face, but I keep going, driven by an unseen force. The air becomes thick with the scent of burning wood and something else, something metallic and acrid.

Finally, I reach the top of the stairs. A battle rages before me, ruin and destruction everywhere I look. Demons, their skin black as night and their eyes ablaze with hatred, fight against angelic beings, their wings in tatters and their swords glowing with celestial energy.

In the midst of the chaos, I see you. My heart leaps with joy and relief. You turn to me, your expression fierce and determined. Without saying a word, we charge into the fray, our blades singing through the air as we fight side by side.

The fight is long and brutal, but eventually, we begin to make headway. The tide of battle turns in our favor, and the demons begin to retreat. As they disappear back into the darkness from which they came, the angels join hands and raise their voices in a celestial chorus. And then, all at once, everything goes quiet.

Everything.

The silence is deafening for a moment before it's broken by the sound of your voice. "Are you okay?" you ask, concern etched into your face. And then I open my eyes.

I'm in bed, sweating profusely from the dream. My heart is pounding, and my breath is coming in ragged gasps. But I realize something in that moment. The fear that's been holding me back was never real. It was just a product of my mind. And now, I'm ready to face anything that comes my way, knowing that I have you by my side. I take a deep breath and force myself to relax, banishing the nightmare from my thoughts.
