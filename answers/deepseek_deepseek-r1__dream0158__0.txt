I am dreaming. *You are floating in an infinite library where the walls breathe, their spines rippling with books bound in pulsating nebulas and beetle-shell iridescence. The air tastes of static and burnt honey. One shelf collapses into a murmuring river of equations, each symbol splitting into Sanskrit roots and quantum diagrams. You reach for a page, but it becomes a flock of origami cranes folded from maps of cities that never existed. Their wings hum with choirs singing inverse philosophies—Marxist-capitalist mantras, thermodynamic haikus about perpetual motion. The floor liquefies into a mosaic of shifting eyes, each pupil reflecting a different version of you—a trilobite version, a cyborg drowning in lotus petals, a screech-owl made of broken violins. You try to scream coherence, but your voice unwinds into a Möbius strip of baroque logic that starts devouring its own tail. Somewhere, Dizzy Gillespie’s trumpet plays a lament in non-Euclidean scales as the dream peels itself into a Klein bottle, dripping axioms that bloom/collapse/bloom like supernovas made of sidewalk chalk.*
