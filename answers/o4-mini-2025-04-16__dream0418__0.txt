I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You wake on the edge of a vast, mirrorsmooth lake under a violet sky. Its surface ripples with every fragile thought in your mind—each wish for connection, each whisper of loneliness. You stand barefoot on a shore of obsidian sand that glows faintly with phosphorescent patterns. Behind you, voices rise and fall in gentle laughter, but with each step you take they fade like echoes in a long hallway.

As you walk along the water’s edge, the moon—huge, pocked, alive—leans close, cradling you in its pale light. In its reflection you see yourself as both spectator and actor: a solitary figure in a crowd of flickering silhouettes. They reach toward you with hands of smoke, beckoning you into their circle, yet every time you lift your own hand to greet them, yours passes through theirs, leaving only a cold wisp of air in its place. A hollow ache blooms in your chest: you ache for their warmth and yet recoil from it, as though an unseen barrier keeps you safe and trapped all at once.

Further down the shore, the water shifts from silver to ink, and from the darkness emerges a path of glowing lilies, each bloom singing a soft note. You realize they are calling your name, nudging you toward a rosecolored forest whose trunks pulse with a heartbeat all their own. Stepping beneath its boughs, you feel the press of unseen faces watching you, mouths parted in silent song. When you try to speak, your voice cracks and dissolves into the leaves above. Loneliness thrums through your veins, but here—amongst these breathing trunks—it feels strangely warm.

Suddenly the forest parts to reveal a single, towering tree draped in thousands of golden feathers. At its base sits a small wooden chest locked tight. Though you’ve been fleeing companionship, you recognize this chest as your own heart. Drawing a trembling breath, you kneel and slide your palm over its surface. The lock clicks open before you even find a key, and when the lid lifts, a soft glow spills out, forming dozens of tiny motes of light that swirl around you. They whisper, “You need not choose between solitude and reunion. Both are part of you.”

In that instant the forest dissolves, the violet sky brightens to rose, and the silhouettes from the shoreline step forward—no longer insubstantial but warm and solid, their expressions tender. They hold out hands that no longer pass through yours but meet your palm in a gentle, grounding clasp. You realize the boundary you felt was never theirs but yours, a shield forged from past hurts and unspoken longing. And here, in this dream’s drifting twilight, you learn that to withdraw is to catch your breath—but to return is to let your own light mingle with others’, weaving a new constellation of connection. You awaken on that glowing shore, the echo of birdsong in your ears, carrying with you the knowledge that loneliness and belonging can coexist—and that at any moment, you hold the power to step back into the circle.
