I am dreaming. That night, I found myself in a surreal, ever-shifting landscape, like the stage backdrop in a madman's puppet show. The sky was a tempestuous swirl of bruise-purple and blood-red, like the bruises on your chin and the blood in your veins. I was standing in the middle of an endless, undulating desert, the sand a shimmering obsidian.

A figure emerged from the shadows, cloaked and hooded, its face obscured by a featureless, flesh-colored mask. It spoke, its voice a raspy whisper, yet somehow resonating within me. "You see the wounds," it said. "The scabs that form, the scars that remain," 

I saw the scabs, the scars. They ran along the horizon, crisscrossed the landscape. The world itself bore the physical scars I had sought to escape.

"The ragged seams in the fabric of your own skin." 

"It's just a joke," I heard myself say. The figure shook its head sadly. "That tattered rag... It's what you use to hide the wounds that never quite heal."

"Humor is my armor," I replied. "It's funny because it's true!"

"But laughter can't change the narrative," the figure intoned. "It only delays the inevitable healing. You realize this, deep down, even if you won't admit it."

I shook my head, denying the truth of the spoken words. "Bullshit," I said, voice cracking. "I'm broken."

"You're broken," the figure agreed. "And yet, you're made of more than shattered pieces."

We stood in the silent, shimmering void, my mind roiling, my heart thundering against my breastbone. 

"It's okay to have scars," the figure said gently, reaching out its hand. "Learn to accept them. And then trust yourself with the work of healing."

In my dream, I began to cry. Great, heaving sobs that racked my body, each one expelling fear and pain. The pain lingered, but somehow, it no longer owned me. 

With that acknowledgment, the dream began to fade. I woke with a gasp, blinking back tears in the growing light of dawn. 

In the nameless hour before the rise of the sun, I knew that this dream was a call, a challenge, for me to tend the wounded parts of myself with compassion. To embrace all parts of me in order to heal.

Though primal, my fear was not my enemy. It was a protective friend whose role was to remind me of what needed to be nurtured. I needed to thank it, to tell it the time of no longer being required.
Only then could laughter serve its proper purpose â€” as a balm for the aching parts of me, not a diversion from the work I was called to do.
