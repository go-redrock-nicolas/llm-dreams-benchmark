I am dreaming. You're adopted into a culture with relationship dynamics completely foreign to your understanding. As you navigate their intricate social matrix, you make friends and enemies. some of whom may have hidden agendas or ulterior motives.

You must use your intuition and empathy to discern their true intentions and align yourself accordingly. You must also balance your loyalty to your new family with your independence and autonomy.
