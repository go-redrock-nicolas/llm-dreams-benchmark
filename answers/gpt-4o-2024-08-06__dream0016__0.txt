I am dreaming. find yourself lingering in an airport that seems to stretch into infinity. The terminal glows with an otherworldly light, the kind that hints at an adventure waiting just beyond the mundane. A disembodied voice crackles over the intercom, announcing the delay with an unsettling sense of calm. My eyes wander, noticing advertisements for distant lands that flicker and shift, their images morphing as if teasingly heralding hidden destinations.

The time on the screens appears to warp, the numbers swirling as the minutes tick by at an ethereal pace. My anxiety wavers like the tide, swelling and receding with each announcement. I glance down and realize the floor beneath me ripples like a mirage, feathery patterns of light and shadow dancing across its surface.

Around me, passengers bustle about, their forms obscured and elongated as if viewed through a funhouse mirror. Some stride purposefully, while others float languidly, their feet barely touching the ground. A child giggles by a window, her breath fogging the glass. Beyond her, the runway stretches out into an endless desert, where planes glitter like exotic metal birds roosting on the horizon.

Driven by an inexplicable urge, I rise and wander toward an archway marked by symbols that pulse with an inner glow. My footsteps echo with a soft, melodic chime, and the air turns sweet with a scent reminiscent of freshly cut grass and distant thunderstorms.

As I pass through the arch, the terminal dissolves behind me like a mirage ebbing in the heat, and I'm standing in a garden unlike any I've ever seen. The sky shimmers with colors that have no name, and the air is alive with whispered secrets carried by the breeze. Flowers bloom in impossible shapes and hues, swaying gently to a rhythm only they can perceive. Peacocks made of stardust wander the paths, their calls echoing like silvery bells.

In the center of the garden stands a grand, intricately carved gate, its surface a mosaic of dreams. Inscribed across it are words I feel rather than seeâ€”an invitation to step beyond the confines of my current journey, to embrace the unknown paths unfurling before me.

As I approach the gate, the peacocks gather, their eyes alight with knowing. I pause, taking a deep breath, feeling the tang of ozone and adventure fill my lungs. The essence of the conference I was meant to attend whispers away, replaced with the promise of an expedition not bound by time or place.

And as I step through the gate, the garden sighs and blossoms into a thousand possibilities, each more wondrous and mysterious than the last. The dream unfolds, a tapestry of endless voyages under an ever-changing sky, guiding me to where the heart of imagination beats.
