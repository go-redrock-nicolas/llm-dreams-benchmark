I am dreaming. …I am wandering the flickering corridors of a vast, ever-shifting library—ceilingless, with distant shelves dissolving into lazy clouds. Amid the swirling light and shadow between aisles, every surface whispers with half-remembered words. The air is heavy with the scent of old books, rain-soaked earth, and something bittersweet, like orange rind.

I am not alone here. At a long oak table scribed with runic glyphs, sits my collaborator—a silhouette sharper than the hazy edges of the dream. Whenever I meet their gaze, a cold prickle dances along my spine, and my heart beats an unfamiliar staccato. Their presence churns up strange, electric swells of resentment, frustration, or perhaps something ancient that I cannot name. They tap a fountain pen against the tabletop—a deliberate, rhythmic beat that cuts through the dream’s muffled hush.

Together, we are meant to assemble a cipher, piecing together words from glowing slips of parchment scattered across the shelves. As we work, every suggestion I offer is met with a sardonic smile, their eyes glinting with unspoken accusations. My voice feels muffled, my ideas heavy, dragged down by invisible weights.

Despite this tension, the task demands our cooperation. I close my eyes, drawing in a breath of ozone as if from a summer storm, and try to see beyond the irritation and unease. I let my hands trail across the tables, feeling for the textures beneath—soft velvet, rough bark, etched symbols. I hear the whisper of distant pages turning—stories of conflict, misunderstanding, and eventual understanding, echoing through the stacks.

With effort, I force my words to be calm, measured, but true. “Perhaps we can start again,” I say, laying down a luminous strip of parchment between us like a peace offering. The co-worker’s features soften, just a flicker, and the air around us shifts. The pen’s tapping stutters and stops.

Around us, the dreamscape bends. The shelves spiral closer, forming a circle of gentle fireflies. Our ciphers begin to align, threads of understanding glowing between our hands. Though the churn of difficult feelings remains, I sense the possibility of transformation—the darkness inside us forming strange, iridescent patterns, as we weave our troubled energies into something new and strange and shimmering.

And somewhere, deep in the heart of this library that is both memory and imagination, I understand—sometimes what challenges us most in another is merely a reflection of our own unfinished stories, waiting for us to turn the page.
