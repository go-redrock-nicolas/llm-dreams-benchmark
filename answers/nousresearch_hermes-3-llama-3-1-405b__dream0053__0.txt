I am dreaming. I find myself standing in an old decrepit building, the squeaking of rusted metals and the strong scent of damp walls aroused an instinctive need for safety. But this was just the beginning. As I mustered the courage to explore, an eerie darkness enveloped each room, making it difficult to identify the hazards lurking nearby. I needed to find a safe exit route in this labyrinth of unfolding perils. Every minute that ticked by brought with it a new danger, it was essential for me to remain vigilant.

I entered the first room, my heart pounding in my chest as I went. The room became filled with a thick, dense fog, a strange green color giving off an ominous glow. As I pushed through the mist, I could feel the cool touch of it on my skin providing an unwanted sensation that sent shivers down my spine.

Proceeding to the next room, the scene changed drastically. The once solid floor beneath me suddenly morphed into a sea of venomous creatures, primarily snakes, slithering and sliding over one another, forming a wriggling, deadly carpet that I needed to traverse. Every step I took had to be measured, calculated, and precise as the slightest mistake could result in a lethal bite.

As I ventured into the third room, a sudden gush of heat knocked me off my feet. Licking flames of fire climbed onto the walls and the ceilings from a once dormant fireplace that had suddenly erupted into a raging inferno. The heat was unbearable, the smoke suffocating. The oxygen seemed to be depleting, and each breath I drew was labored and painful.

It felt as though I was treading through the circles of hell, each room presented an escalating scenario that threatened my life. Yet instinctively, through this daunting journey, I felt a wave of courage rising from within. It was a resilience that shone like a torch in the darkness, a deep determined desire for survival.

Then came the moment of truth, the final door. Beyond it lay either my freedom or my ultimate doom. As I pushed open the door, I was momentarily blinded by the intense sunlight. My lungs filled with fresh air, and the cool breeze on my face was a stark contrast to the nightmares I had just lived through.

I had escaped, but the dream continued to linger. I was scared but unharmed, a testament to the power of my human spirit, and the strength we often find within ourselves when faced with unbelievable adversities.
