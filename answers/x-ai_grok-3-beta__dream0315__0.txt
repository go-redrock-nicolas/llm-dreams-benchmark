I am dreaming. As I slip into the realm of dreams, the world around me dissolves into a kaleidoscope of surreal colors and shifting landscapes, a place where reality bends and whispers secrets through enigmatic symbols. I find myself standing on the edge of an endless, glassy lake, its surface a perfect mirror reflecting a sky ablaze with twilight hues of deep indigo and fiery amber. The air is thick with a sweet, otherworldly scent, like jasmine mixed with the crispness of autumn leaves, and a soft hum reverberates through the stillness, as if the universe itself is chanting a forgotten lullaby.

Suddenly, I notice the first recurring symbol: a majestic white stag with antlers that shimmer like spun silver, standing at the far shore of the lake. Its eyes, pools of ancient wisdom, lock onto mine, and I feel an unspoken summons pulling at my very soul. This stag has appeared in countless dreams before, always watching, always waiting. I sense it represents a guide, perhaps my own inner yearning for direction or enlightenment, a beacon urging me toward a path I have yet to fully comprehend. My heart races as I step forward, the cool water lapping at my bare feet, but the stag turns and vanishes into a mist that rises like a curtain of silk, leaving me with a pang of longing.

As I wade deeper into the lake, the water transforms into a swirling vortex of ink-black liquid, and from its depths emerges the second symbol: a cracked, golden hourglass, floating just above the surface. Sand spills endlessly from its broken halves, yet the grains never diminish, cascading into the lake and dissolving into ripples of light. I’ve seen this hourglass before, always fractured, always bleeding time into the void. I interpret it as a reminder of mortality, a symbol of time slipping through my fingers, or perhaps a warning that something precious is being lost. Its golden glow feels both warm and mournful, and as I reach out to touch it, my fingers pass through its ethereal form, leaving me with a hollow ache in my chest.

The scene shifts abruptly, as dreams often do, and I’m no longer in the lake but in an endless forest of towering, obsidian trees, their bark gleaming like polished stone under a moon that burns crimson. Here, the third symbol manifests—a raven with feathers of midnight blue, perched on a gnarled branch. It tilts its head, and in its beak, it clutches a wilted rose, petals falling like tears to the mossy ground below. This raven has haunted my dreams for as long as I can remember, always bearing something broken or decayed. I interpret it as a messenger of transformation, a harbinger of endings that must precede new beginnings. The wilted rose, I feel, symbolizes love or beauty that has been neglected, a part of me crying out for renewal. As I approach, the raven spreads its wings, releasing a cry that echoes like a human sob, and takes flight, dropping the rose at my feet.

I bend to pick it up, and the forest melts away, replaced by a boundless desert of silver sand under a sky fractured with lightning. At the horizon, all three symbols—the stag, the hourglass, and the raven—stand silhouetted against the storm, converging as if to weave their messages into a singular truth. My heart thunders as I walk toward them, the sand warm and shifting beneath me, each grain whispering fragments of forgotten memories. I feel that these symbols are pleading with me to listen, to unravel their interconnected meanings. The stag’s guidance, the hourglass’s urgency, the raven’s call for transformation—they seem to point to a crossroads in my waking life, a decision or revelation I’ve been avoiding.

As I draw closer, the storm intensifies, and the symbols begin to dissolve into the electric air, their forms blending into one another until they are nothing but a shimmering mirage. A voice, both mine and not mine, resonates from the tempest: “Seek what is hidden in the light.” I awaken with a start, the words echoing in my mind, my skin tingling with the lingering touch of the dream’s vividness. I lie there, piecing together the puzzle, feeling that somewhere within these symbols lies a map to understanding a deeper part of myself—a journey I must undertake, both in dreams and in the waking world.
