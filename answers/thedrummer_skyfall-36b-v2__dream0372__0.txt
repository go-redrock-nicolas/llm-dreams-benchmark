I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a vast, expanse of tranquil blue sky, anchored securely in the warm and familiar embrace of your own soul. You feel light, at ease, and open to possibilities.

As you gaze around, you begin to notice elements of your past drifting in the air around you. They appear not as distressing memories or regrets, but as gentle wisps of softly glowing light.

You reach out a hand to touch one. It transforms into a beautiful butterfly, symbolizing transformation and renewal, its wings shimmering with iridescent hues of deep blue, vibrant purple, and brilliant gold.

As you let the butterfly alight upon your finger, you feel a welcomed shift from within. The

, the part of your psyche once stifled by fear and doubt, begins to live and breathe anew.

Do you let go of the butterfly, or keep it close as a reminder of the magic and possibility available to you in this present moment?
