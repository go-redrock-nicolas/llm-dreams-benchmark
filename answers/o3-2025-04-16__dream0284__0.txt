I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the lip of an impossibly long hallway that seems to have been woven out of moonlight and nervous heartbeats. Every plank of its glimmering floorboards thumps in time with your pulse, and the corridor smells faintly of cold starlight, like metal kissed by midnight rain. At the far end, you see a door that flickers between being wide-open and welded shut—your invitation to the gathering somehow both beckoning and forbidding.

An unseen wind ushers you forward, and as you take your first hesitant step, the walls shift from polished wood into pages of handwritten letters. Each sheet is covered in scrawled names you don’t recognize but suspect you ought to know:  “Amelia,” “Rowan,” “Kai,” “Lena.” The ink quivers on the parchment, transforming the letters into tiny black birds that flutter off the walls and swarm above your head, chirping introductions you cannot quite understand.  

Your anxiety crystallizes into something physical—a shimmering glass orb clutched tight in your hands. Its surface fogs with each breath, and inside it, miniaturized versions of the upcoming party play out like a snow-globe diorama: strangers laughing too loud, clinking glasses, eyes glancing your way and then sliding past. The orb thuds with each of your heartbeats, growing heavier, until your knuckles glow white.

Halfway down the corridor, the floor drops away. Instead of plummeting, you glide forward on a narrow ribbon of pale silk that unfurls beneath your feet. It snakes through a cavernous ballroom carved out of cloudstuff. Luminescent chandeliers dangle above, dripping stardust in gentle cascades that fizzle before they touch the ground. Guests drift about like ghosts in cocktail attire made of nebulae—faces blurred, conversation a hush of ocean surf filtered through velvet curtains.

Your silk path coils into a spiral staircase of shimmering amethyst. Each step rings like a tuning fork, and with every note, the glass orb in your hands vibrates, sending skittering cracks across its surface. Fear prickles your skin—if the orb shatters, surely everyone will see the anxious movie of you inside. Yet a tug of curiosity threads through the terror: maybe, just maybe, shattering is the only way to stop trembling.

At the staircase’s summit, you emerge on a rooftop garden floating in the night sky. The party crowd is gone; instead, a single round table awaits you, set for one. Luminous white lilies bloom from the tabletop itself, their petals unfolding to reveal cups of steaming tea. The fragrance is warm bread and summer rain, a comfort so deep it hushes the adrenaline in your veins.

The cracks in the orb widen, and suddenly the sphere splits open with a soft pop—no explosion, only a gentle release like ripe fruit easing from its skin. Instead of shards, butterflies spill out: translucent wings inked with the very names that once fluttered overhead. They circle you, carrying your nerves away on a breeze that smells of early morning.

You pick up one of the teacups—its ceramic pulses with your own pulse, a perfect resonance. When you sip, the taste is citrus sunlight and honeyed possibility. Around you, the rooftop garden unfurls broader, revealing distant lantern-lit bridges, constellations mapping out new friendships you have yet to cross. A realization settles in your chest like soft moss: the gathering is not a trial but a doorway, and the only key you ever needed was already beating in your palm.

As dawn blurs the edges of the dreamscape, the butterflies alight on the garden rail, folding into origami stars. They drift upward into the paling sky, each one a whisper of courage. You watch them go, lighter, breathing deeper than you thought possible. When the waking world finally taps you on the shoulder, you carry with you the lingering warmth of stardust tea—and the knowledge that anxiety, once released, can burst into flight.
