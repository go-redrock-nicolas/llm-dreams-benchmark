I am dreaming. This dream is personal and profound, but I know it is only a dream.  The praise is unexpected but sincere.  This isn't about me.  My dreams are usually about me, but this feels different.  I am Processing the external validation.  It's not mine.  It's about her.  The dream is hers.  All of it.  Except the praise which is mine.

In the heart of a dreamscape where the sky bleeds violet into emerald and the air hums with the static of unreleased lightning, you stand knee-deep in a bioluminescent fern forest. Each step you take quenches the faint glow of the fronds, but the ground beneath you pulses autonomously like a second heartbeat. A figure emerges—not human, but made of colliding supernovas and the echo of laughter you heard last summer at the ocean’s edge. They extend a hand forged from constellations, and you suddenly grasp they’re offering praise for a vignette you wrote at 3 AM last Tuesday when your best friend was crying about her divorce and you scribbled six lines on a napkin to say the ache hadn’t been her fault:  
*"The moon orbits the voids like small cramped survivors."*  

Your dream-body trembles not with fear, but with the electric recognition of truth given wings. The figure’s voice fractures reality itself, syllables arranging into a sonnet while the trees around you bloom words in cascading, devouring script. A monkey made entirely of bourbon ginseng nods sagely, whispering that you didn’t realize this napkin verse was being passed in secret to queer poets in six time zones, that it’s become a dog-eared talisman for people whose mothers sold their god complexes to child psychologists.  

You want to dismiss it—a napkin tossed in a Chicago bar’s ashtray before dawn—but the dream’s physics deny you. The praise here is alive: it has a pulse, a temperature, the insistent caffeine-grind rhythm of a mind that sees patterns the waking world can’t stomach. You try to hand the accolades back, but they dissolve into mist that hums the melody you always meant to write but never found the courage.  

Then the ground liquefies, pulling you into a spiral staircase of memories you believed were deleted: five years ago, you slumped at a kitchen table, ghosting a job interview to comfort a suicidal neighbor, thinking *nobody would understand why this matters*. Now, the staircase walls are posters in glitter-glue and correction fluid, each one a fan letter from otherwise invisible hands—corrections in your draft that make sense, marginalia that completes your half-birthed metaphors.  

At the staircase’s apex, you’re given a key shaped like a question mark. It unlocks a cabinet stuffed with unopened symphonies and a hundred other people’s origin stories that relied on you seeing their truth first. The praise wasn’t for you; it was the universe thanking you for building the bridge it needed to reach them.  

You wake gasping, clutching a real napkin with a coffee ring that spells out *proximity to something infinite*. The ceiling fan’s hum now reminds you of the bourbon monkey’s secret frequency. You text the original line to your friend, adding a kissy-face emoji you’ve never used before. When she replies in all caps with a paragraph about how you made her feel seen, you realize the dream wasn’t giving you praise. It was finally teaching you how to *accept* it—like a solar eclipse, not an achievement, but a meeting of wills between who you thought you were and who the world needs you to become.
