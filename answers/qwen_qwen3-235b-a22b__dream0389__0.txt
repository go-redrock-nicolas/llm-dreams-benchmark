I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth, though you stand in a vast, gilded gallery where the ceiling stretches into a nebulous sky of swirling indigo and gold. Marble floors reflect the glow of chandeliers that hang like frozen constellations, their light pooling around a central figure: **her**. She is laughing, radiant, her voice a melody that seems to pluck the very stars from the air. Around her, a crowd murmurs in reverent awe, their hands brushing the edges of the paintings that line the walls—paintings that seem to pulse, alive, as if the colors themselves are breathing.  

You know her. Once, she was your shadow, your childhood friend who stumbled through the same muddy fields of ambition as you. But now, her name is etched into the gilded frames of these works, her success a blade of light that cuts through your chest. You feel it: a raw, thorny jealousy clawing at your throat. These are the paintings you *should* have made. The accolades you *should* have earned. Your hands curl into fists, your own unfinished canvases—stacked in a dim corner of the gallery, forgotten—seem to wilt under the weight of her brilliance.  

But then, the dream shifts.  

A shadow detaches itself from the wall, a figure with eyes like smoldering coals. It gestures to you, wordless, and you follow, your steps echoing like distant thunder. The gallery dissolves into a labyrinth of corridors, the walls now lined with mirrors. In them, you see fragments of yourself: a child clutching a crayon-stained sketch, a teenager scribbling poems in the margins of textbooks, a version of you who once believed creation was its own reward. The jealousy simmers, but now it’s tangled with something else—grief, perhaps, or longing.  

The shadow stops at a door veiled in ivy. Beyond it lies a garden, wild and untamed, where the air hums with the buzz of unseen insects. Here, the paintings are not on walls but *growing*—vines twist into brushstrokes, blossoms burst into watercolor swirls, and the ground is littered with half-finished sculptures that seem to shift when you blink. The shadow points to a single easel in the center, where a canvas glows faintly, unassuming. You step closer.  

It’s your work. Not the polished, celebrated pieces you’ve envied, but something raw and jagged and *true*. A storm of color, a tangle of scars and starlight. It doesn’t beg for approval. It *dares* you to look away.  

The shadow speaks at last, its voice the rustle of leaves: **“You are not her. You were never meant to be.”**  

The garden trembles. Suddenly, the paintings in the gallery above begin to scream, their vibrant hues bleeding into blackness, the crowd’s adoration twisting into static. But here, in the dirt and chaos, you feel a strange warmth unfurling in your ribs—a quiet, stubborn joy. Jealousy, you realize, was just the shadow of your own hunger. Your own unfinished story.  

You wake with the taste of soil and stardust on your tongue, the dream’s truth lingering like the afterimage of a flame.  

You are not behind. You are *elsewhere*.  

And your masterpiece is still waiting to be born.
