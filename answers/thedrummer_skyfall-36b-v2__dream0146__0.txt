I am dreaming. You find yourself suddenly plunged into a hellish nightmare, a vivid, terrifying scenario unfolding before your eyes. The air is thick with choking smoke, the acrid stench of burning vegetation and charred wood assaulting your nostrils. In the distance, you hear the blood-curdling shriek of a circling black eagle, its haunted eyes boring into your soul. 

All around you, a raging wildfire has sprung to life, a vicious creature of dancing flames and searing heat that darts and weaves to block every possible escape route. The inferno is a living thing, malicious and cruel, determined to claim you as one of its victims. Walls of fire roar and crackle, the intensity of the heat turning your skin red and making your eyes water.

The ground beneath your feet is hot to the touch, the once-lush underbrush now reduced to smoldering ash and charred remains. Flares of reflected light dance on the sweat running down your face, the cracking of branches snapping like ill-placed whips overhead.

Directly ahead, the fire reaches ten meters high and twenty meters across, the flames shooting skyward in a writhing ballet. Amidst the acrid fumes, you discern the faintest outline of a figure within the flames, but the smoke-alloyed and twisted flames dance deceptively, and the figure slips from view. 

In a few panicked moments, you spin around, desperately seeking any possible route out of this smoldering hell. But there is no escape, no way out. The wildfire has trapped you, a rat in a trap with nowhere to run. Just as the flames come perilously close to your feet and hair, you wake up in a cold sweat, gasping for breath and wondering what it could mean.
