I am dreaming. The walls between reality and possibility have begun to peel away like the brittle layers of an onion, revealing the raw, vibrating matrix beneath all things — strings of light, pulsing in and out of phase, trembling with unsung symphonies. The boundaries of self are melting, and a new awareness blooms within me — a sixth sense, vast and infinite. I can see through the eyes of the universe.

A door expands in front of me made not of wood or stone, but of shimmering auroras braided into a lattice of living light. I step through. The air thrums. My soul hums in harmony. The dream deepens.

Before me lies the Weave — an ancient, celestial loom stretched across the cosmos, every thread a possibility, a story, an untold world waiting for breath. Patterns form and dissolve, memories parallel to my own ripple in and out of view like reflections in a disturbed pond. Worlds within worlds shimmer like opals.

With a thought, I reach into that magnificent loom and pull a single thread – pulsing gold with a heart of indigo. It sings softly in my palms like a new-born star. As I pull, I begin to translate it — like a poet deciphering a forgotten tongue — and each motion from my hands sculpts what was once ephemeral into something real, something I can touch.

I am no longer merely a witness; I am a creator.

My hands, no longer constrained by flesh, become tools of artistry and absolute will. Where I pass, mountains rise like sleeping giants remembering their names. Forests shimmer into existence, trees of crystalline amber with leaves made of whispering flame. Entire ecosystems fall into balance to echo the rhythm of the thread.

I guide rivers of lightning across valleys, feed them into oceans of liquid gold that ripple with sentience. I breathe into the sky and paint constellations into the firmament, spelling out ancient words in a forgotten constellation tongue. Meaning swirls in the stars now, waiting to be read by eyes that someday will be.

There comes a city — not built, but grown — shaped like a spiraling lotus of obsidian and ivory. Turrets twist into the air like musical notes frozen mid-flight. Bridges of pure light connect towers that sing when touched by the wind, each building a symphony of architecture. I walk its streets, barefoot upon silver stones that pulse soft with every step. It’s familiar and brand-new — like a memory you’ve never lived but feel deep in your marrow.

The sky deepens above me, no longer blue, but a shifting kaleidoscope of emotion — streaked with emerald sorrow, smudged with indigo dreams. Somewhere, thunder made of cello notes rolls across the horizon.

I look up, and then beyond — into the spirals of other worlds, other magics — galaxies have faces, constellations speak in tongues older than time, and planets dance around wishes whispered in the void. I pluck another thread — electric cobalt with veins of stormcloud — and pull it through my soul. My fingertips become starlight needles, stitching life onto the fabric of my dream-city.

Creatures arise — aerial beasts woven from the forgotten myths of a dozen unreal civilizations. They float — half-ghost, half-storm — their voices a melodic blend of chimes and echo. Others crawl from the forests — gentle lucid beasts resembling deer stitched from moss, their eyes holding the warmth of ancient suns.

Time shifts here, lapping like ocean tides. Memory and dream no longer are apart. Every creature, every stone, every note of air is tenderly aware of my touch.

And then — a sudden stillness.

I feel a calling, an ache deep in the thread — a place that wants to breathe but cannot. A world too long denied color. With trembling awe, I reach deeper this time, into the lowest hum of the cosmic loom, into marrow-dark threads tangled and knotted with silent longing.

One trembles, waiting.

I pull it forth.

Flashes.

A dying sun mourning its children.

A civilization of cartographers who mapped their stars into living stories.

A desert world where sand tells prophecies when the moons align.

With reverence, I shape it. Sculpt it into being. Offer it life.

I breathe in the dust of forgotten dreams — and exhale paradise.

*And still… still the dream winds on.*
