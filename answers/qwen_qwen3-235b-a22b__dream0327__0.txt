I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of trees, their trunks spiraling like braided silver, leaves shimmering with the iridescence of dragonfly wings. The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, and every step you take leaves a faint phosphorescent trail, as though the ground remembers your touch. You are walking toward a lake you’ve never seen but have always known—a mirror of liquid mercury, still and perfect, reflecting a sky stitched with constellations that pulse like living veins.  

At the water’s edge, *they* are waiting.  

The person you loved—or thought you loved, or thought you understood—stands there, but their form is fluid, shifting. One moment, they wear the face you remember: familiar, beloved, a mosaic of every inside joke, every shared silence. The next, their features dissolve like ink in water, reforming into something alien—a stranger with eyes like twin eclipses, a mouth that smiles without warmth. You feel the old ache of misunderstanding rise in your throat, the same knot of frustration that once made you turn away in waking life. But here, in the dream, the rules are different.  

The lake begins to whisper.  

Its voice is a chorus of memories, but not the ones you curated. These are raw, unspooled threads: the time you misread their quietness as indifference, their vulnerability as strength, their silence as consent. You see yourself in these reflections, small and distorted, a caricature of your waking self—arms crossed, eyes narrowed, a fortress of assumptions. The dream tightens around you like a vise. *You were wrong*, the lake hisses, not cruelly, but with the cold clarity of a scalpel. *You built a myth of them, then blamed them for not fitting inside it.*  

Suddenly, the figure before you stops shifting. They kneel, pressing a hand to the mirrored water. Ripples spread outward, and in their wake, the lake reveals what it swallowed: moments you’d forgotten or refused to see. A trembling hand reaching for yours, withdrawn too soon. A laugh that cracked at the end, betraying tears. A door left ajar, not slammed shut. The dream floods you with these fragments, and you feel them not as facts, but as *truths*—sensory, visceral. The sting of their loneliness. The weight of their fear. The way they loved you in a language you never learned to speak.  

You sink to your knees, the ground now soft as moth-wing dust. The figure touches your forehead, and their hand is neither warm nor cold, but alive with a thousand simultaneous sensations: the prickle of rain, the hush of snow, the heat of a palm held too briefly. “You saw me as a mirror,” they say, their voice resonant as a struck bell. “But I was always a window. You just never looked through me… until now.”  

The landscape shudders. The silver trees begin to melt, their branches dripping into rivers of gold. The sky peels back to reveal a vast, pulsing nebula. The lake evaporates into a mist that clings to your skin, each droplet a tiny prism refracting all possible versions of your story. You feel unmoored, unmade, and yet—strangely—more *you* than ever before. The dream is not angry. It is not kind. It is simply *true*, and truth here is not a weapon but a wildfire, burning away the scaffolding of your illusions.  

When you wake, the residue lingers: the taste of starlight, the ache of a heart recalibrating, the echo of a voice that was never theirs, but yours all along.
