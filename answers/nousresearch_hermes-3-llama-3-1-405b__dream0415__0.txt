I am dreaming. I am surrounded by the rich warmth of safety, of peace that at first soothes me.  I am in a group of people; they exist on the fringe of my awareness as their voices are muffled and unclear.  

They are far enough away that I do not feel pressed upon, but they exist so I know that I am not alone in this place.  For a moment it is as if they are behind a curtain of gauze; I know that they are there, but I can't clearly see them or hear them.  This gauze keeps me protected and safe, a barrier between us that feels right and good.  

Someone steps forward, pushing through that gauze, encroaching upon my space.  They are smiling at me, and whether it is a smile of warmth or of cunning, I can't discern.  Still, the space between us has closed; they have come too close and I feel the discomfort of that closeness. 

In their hand is a book, and they open it, handing it to me.  It is my journal, and in it are my deepest thoughts, my secrets and stories.  They ask me to share, to read a passage, to be vulnerable here in this space, in front of these others.  It feels too revealing, too raw, too uncomfortable.  I can feel the eyes upon me, the weight of expectation.  

I look at the person, and their face is kind;  they think they are offering an invitation, not a demand.  But the pressure is there nonetheless.  I look around at the other faces, some are looking at me, some are looking away.  Some are eager, some are uncomfortable.  

For a moment I wonder if it's a test, a pass or fail of my willingness to participate, to be "one of them".  Do they judge me if I say no, if I decline to open those pages and share what is within?  Will they see me as closed or standoffish?  Aloof or unapproachable?  

This is a dream of social pressure, of navigating the expectations of others, of determining where one's own boundaries lie.  Of wrestling with the questions of "how much is too much?" and "how much is not enough?"  It is a knife-edge of personal preference and values, of deciding who and what is important.  It is a balance between protecting oneself and experiencing true connection... and therein lies the rub.  It is a dream of a question without a clear answer.  Of nuance and complexity.  Of being human.
