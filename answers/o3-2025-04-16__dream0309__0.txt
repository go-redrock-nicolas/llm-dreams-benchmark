I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the edge of a cathedral made of rippling aurora-borealis glass, its towers pulsing like the slow heartbeat of a cosmic whale. The floor beneath your bare feet is a quilt of glowing constellations—each star a moment of sweat, study, or sleepless midnight plotting that built your triumphs brick by brick. You step forward, and the constellations brighten, humming in tones that sound suspiciously like your own laughter after a hard-won victory.

Halfway down the aisle, a hush drapes the air. From the far end of the nave, a second figure materializes: a robed jester stitched together from lottery tickets, four-leaf clovers, and the shimmering scales of a fish you have never caught. Its bells don’t jingle; they sigh, an exhale of dice hitting green felt. The jester bows with overblown courtesy, then raises a hand and flings a deck of shimmering tarot cards into the air. The cards orbit your body in luminous rings, each one flashing images of coin tosses, tipping points, and forks in roads you almost didn’t take.

“Talent and toil?” it coos in a voice of wind-chimes. “Or a lucky gust at your back?”

The cathedral’s walls begin to revolve like a planetarium, scrolling through alternate histories: one shows you missing that crucial bus to the interview, another depicts a random mentor walking past without noticing your desperation. Every chance avoided is a pillar ego might have leaned on—but now the pillars blur, leaving you afloat.

A flicker of panic lifts inside your ribs, but you inhale, summoning the memory of every night you bent the world to your will: code debugged until sunrise, calloused fingers blistering on strings, pages filled, prototypes broken and reborn. Those memories heat your bones until steam blooms from your skin. You stretch out your arms, and in your palms erupt twin quills wrought from molten sunrise. You slash the air, writing glowing equations, sonnets, and schematics that whip around like dragonflies, weaving a lattice of intention between you and the jester.

The jester laughs—a sound like shuffled cards—and tosses a final offering: a single copper coin. It spins toward you, glittering with possibility. You pluck it mid-air, close your fist, and feel the coin shudder, split, dissolve. When you open your hand, instead of metal, there’s a seed—small, veined with starlight.

You plant it in the constellation floor. Instantly a tree erupts, limbs scribbled in calligraphy. On each leaf you read your efforts: notes from forgotten practice sessions, smudged checklists, dog-eared textbooks. Yet in the crooks of those branches rest strands of serendipity—chance introductions, sudden inspirations, green lights at empty intersections. The tree refuses to choose between them; it thrives on both.

The jester surveys the blossoming canopy, then doffs its hat. Its lottery-ticket fabric unravels into golden threads that drift upward and fuse with the stained-glass ceiling, turning the cathedral into a greenhouse of swirling dawn. The figure fades, leaving only the faint rustle of a gambler’s final sigh.

You step back, gazing at the tree that is yours alone—roots watered by labor, leaves kissed by fortune. In that bright hush, the conflict inside you settles, not into triumph or surrender, but into harmony, a chord you didn’t know you’d been learning to play.

Somewhere far off, an alarm clock rings like a distant bell tower. The dream recedes, but the seed’s warmth lingers in your palm as waking daylight peels open your eyelids, and you rise knowing the truth is not either/or but the alchemy between sweat and stardust.
