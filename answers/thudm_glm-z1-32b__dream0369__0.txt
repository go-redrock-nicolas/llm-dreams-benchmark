<beginofsentence># 1.3 Array Bounds and Fixed-Length Arrays

An array is a fixed-size sequence of memory compartments of the same data type. It's defined using data type, array name, and dimensions. Number of dimensions determines if it's a single, double, or multi-dimensional array. Arrays can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Array bounds: the minimum and maximum indices allowed for each dimension in the array. Lower bound=0, upper bound=size-1. For nested arrays, the index range is low=0, high=size-1. Multi-dimensional arrays are considered row-major, so the rightmost subarray index changes fastest.

Fixed-length arrays have a predetermined number of elements. Their size must be known at compile time. In Java, fixed-length arrays are created with the new keyword, and their size is fixed. Trying to assign a value beyond array bounds will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Zero-based indexing: most programming languages start array indices at 0. The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, etc. The last element is at index=size-1.

Array insertions and deletions: inserting or deleting elements at the beginning, middle, or end requires shifting elements and is therefore O(n) time complexity. Adding/removing at the end is O(1) if there is space. Deleting the last element is O(1).

Array length: the actual number of elements stored in the array. If the array has 10 slots and 7 are filled, length is 7. The size (or capacity) of the array is the maximum number of elements it can hold. A dynamically resizing array (like a List in Java) has a capacity that can grow when needed.

Java example of array declaration:

int[] arr = new int[10]; 

The array arr has 10 elements, indexed from 0 to 9. If you try to access arr[10], you get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

In C++, dynamically-sized arrays can be created using vector<int> vec; which automatically handles resizing. However, accessing vec[i] for i >= vec.size() also results in undefined behavior and can cause program crashes.

In Python, lists are dynamic. They grow as needed and can have arbitrary sizes. However, accessing valid indices still follows zero-based indexing, e.g., my_list[3] is the fourth element. Appending to a list is O(1) amortized time.

Multi-dimensional arrays: in Java, a 2D array is defined as int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];. The matrix has 3 rows and 4 columns. Access as matrix[row][col], where row is from 0 to 2, col from 0 to 3. Java's ragged arrays are arrays where each subarray can have different lengths. For example, int[][] jagged = new int[3][];. Then jagged[0] = new int[2];, jagged[1] = new int[3];.

Memory allocation for multi-dimensional arrays: in Java, each subarray occupies separate memory. The main array holds references to each subarray. This is different from C/C++ where a 2D array is stored as a contiguous block of memory.

Array performance considerations: accessing elements by index is O(1), random access. Traversing the array is O(n). Insertion, deletion can be O(n). Dynamic arrays (like ArrayList in Java) have some overhead due to needing to occasionally resize, but their amortized cost is still O(1) for appending.

Applications of arrays: used in implementing other data structures like stacks, queues, hash tables. Java's HashSet and HashMap use arrays internally, along with linked lists or trees for collision resolution. Stacks in Java's Stack class are implemented using an underlying array and following LIFO order. Queues can use arrays to provide O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations with front and rear pointers.

Another example in C: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int nums[5]; // declares a fixed-length array of 5 integers
    nums[0] = 42;
    nums[1] = 17;
    printf("The value at index 0 is %d.\n", nums[0]);
    return 0;
}

This code declares an array nums of size 5, initializes the first two elements, and prints the value at index 0.

In the context of algorithms, arrays serve as fundamental building blocks. For instance, sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort operate on arrays. Searching algorithms like binary search require the array to be sorted.

When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, the time complexity can vary. For example, searching in a 2D array could be O(n^2) in the worst case if it's unsorted. However, if it's a matrix sorted row-wise and column-wise, there can be optimizations to reduce the time complexity to O(n + m) for an n x m matrix.

In Java, when you create an array, you can initialize it with values: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 

The array numbers now has 5 elements. If you want to access the third element, you use numbers[2], which is 3.

Another important concept is array sparseness, where many elements are undefined or default values (like 0 for integers). Sparse arrays can be optimized with special data structures like a dictionary mapping indices to values.

Array operations like concatenation, slicing, and cloning are common. In Python, for example, you can slice a list with list[2:5] to get elements from index 2 to 4. Java doesn't have a built-in slice function, but you can copy ranges using System.arraycopy().

In terms of memory management, arrays in Java are objects. Each array has a length field, and the elements are stored contiguously. Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays, so each subarray is a separate object in memory.

Using arrays for efficiency: when you need random access and you know the size upfront, arrays are preferable. For example, in a game, you might use an array to store the positions of all enim es on the screen since their indices can be calculated based on their screen location.

In C++, the vector is a dynamic array that automatically manages its size. When you push_back() an element, if there's space, it's added. If not, the vector doubles its capacity. This allows for efficient growth while amortizing the cost of reallocation.

When using arrays, it's important to handle edge cases, especially with indices. For example, when iterating through an array from 0 to length - 1, you have to ensure that the loop condition doesn't cause an off-by-one error.

In Python, lists are mutable and can be modified after creation. You can change individual elements, append, insert, remove, etc. For example:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[1] = 5
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]

This modifies the second element, then adds a fourth element.

Array-based implementations of data structures:

- Stack: use an array where the last element is considered the top. Push adds to the end, pop removes from the end. Both operations are O(1).

- Queue: can be implemented using an array with two pointers, front and rear. Enqueue adds to the rear, dequeue removes from the front. To avoid moving elements, it can be a circular queue, where the rear wraps around to the beginning if the end is reached.

- Hash Table: uses an array of buckets. Each bucket can be a linked list for collision resolution. When inserting, compute the hash to find the bucket, then add to the linked list. Retrieval is O(1) on average.

Choosing between array and linked list: arrays have better cache locality because elements are stored contiguously, leading to faster access times. However, linked lists allow for O(1) insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions (if you have a reference to the node).

In Java, using an ArrayList (which is backed by an array) versus a LinkedList: ArrayList has O(1) random access but O(n) insertion/deletion in the middle. LinkedList has O(1) insertions/deletions once you have the node, but O(n) access time and uses more memory for node pointers.

Another example in C:

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("Element at index %d is %d\n", i, arr[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

This code initializes an array arr with values 10 to 50, calculates the size by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element, then loops through and prints each element.

When working with multi-dimensional arrays, care must be taken with parameters. For example, in Java, you can't pass a 2D array as a parameter without specifying the dimensions. C allows more flexibility with pointer arithmetic.

In summary, arrays are versatile and fundamental, but understanding their bounds, performance characteristics, and proper usage is crucial to avoid errors and write efficient code.
Arrays are foundational data structures that provide efficient storage and access for elements of the same type. In Java, when creating a fixed-length array like `int[] arr = new int[10];`, the size is immutable, meaning it cannot be resized once initialized. Attempting to access an index beyond its bounds (e.g., `arr[10]`) triggers an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, emphasizing the need to always validate indices against `array.length - 1`.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Zeros-Based Indexing**  
   Arrays in most languages start at **0**, not 1. The first element is at index `0`, and the last is at `length - 1`. For example, a `String[] words = {"Hello", "World"}` has `words[0] = "Hello"` and `words[1] = "World"`.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**  
   Java allows jagged arrays, where each subarray can vary in length. Declaring a 2D array like `int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];` creates a 3x4 grid. Accessing `matrix[0][3]` retrieves the fourth element of the first row. For ragged arrays:  
   ```java
   int[][] jagged = new int[3][]; // Three rows, each of dynamic length
   jagged[0] = new int[2];      // First row has 2 elements
   jagged[1] = new int[5];      // Second row has 5 elements
   ```

3. **Dynamic Resizing with Collections**  
   While fixed arrays are inflexible, Javaâ€™s `ArrayList<E>` handles resizing automatically. For example, appending elements with `list.add(42)` grows the underlying array as needed, amortizing operations to **O(1)**. This avoids the manual reallocation required with raw arrays:
   ```java
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add(10); // Size 1
   list.add(20); // Size 2
   list.ensureCapacity(100); // Preallocates space for 100 elements
   ```

4. **Memory and Performance**  
   - **Contiguous Memory**: Arrays store elements consecutively, enabling **O(1) random access** and excellent cache locality.  
   - **Insertion/Deletion Overhead**: Inserting at the start or middle requires shifting elements, leading to **O(n)** time. For example, inserting `5` at index 0 in `{10, 20, 30}` becomes `[5, 10, 20, 30]` with three shifts.  
   - **Dynamic Arrays**: `ArrayList` in Java uses a capacity threshold (e.g., doubling when full). Insertions at the end are **amortized O(1)**, while insertions elsewhere still require shifts.

5. **Use Cases and Implementations**  
   - **Stacks**: An array-based stack with `top` pointer allows O(1) push/pop operations at the end.  
     ```java
     class Stack {
         int[] arr;
         int top;
         Stack(int size) { arr = new int[size]; top = -1; }
         void push(int val) { arr[++top] = val; }
         int pop() { return arr[top--]; }
     }
     ```
   - **Queues**: A circular queue prevents wasted space by wrapping indices.  
     ```java
     class Queue {
         int[] arr;
         int front, rear;
         Queue(int size) { arr = new int[size]; front = rear = -1; }
         void enqueue(int val) {
             if (rear == arr.length - 1) rear = 0; // Wrap around
             arr[++rear] = val;
         }
         int dequeue() { return arr[++front]; }
     }
     ```
   - **Hash Tables**: Arrays serve as buckets. For example, a hash function `index = key % size` directs entries to subarrays, with collision resolution via chaining (linked lists) or open addressing.

6. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**  
   - **Negative Indices**: Many languages (e.g., Java, C#) throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for negative indices.  
   - **Out-of-Bounds**: Always validate indices:  
     ```java
     if (index < 0 || index >= arr.length) {
         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Index out of bounds");
     }
     ```

### Real-World Example:
A **matrix rotation** algorithm can leverage arrays efficiently. Rotating a 90-degree clockwise NÃ—N matrix in place rearranges elements such that `[row][col]` becomes `[col][N - 1 - row]`. For a 3x3 matrix:  
```
Original: [1, 2, 3]    ->    Transposed: [1, 4, 7]  
       [4, 5, 6]              [2, 5, 8]  
       [7, 8, 9]              [3, 6, 9]  
After Rotation:          Final: [7, 4, 1]  
                                 [8, 5, 2]  
                                 [9, 6, 3]  
```  
Code snippet:  
```java
public static void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
    int n = matrix.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Swap elements across the diagonal
            int temp = matrix[i][j];
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
            matrix[j][i] = temp;
        }
    }
}
// Reverse rows to complete the rotation
for (int[] row : matrix) {
    reverse(row);
}

private static void reverse(int[] row) {
    int start = 0, end = row.length - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        int temp = row[start];
        row[start] = row[end];
        row[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

### Summary:
Arrays form the backbone of many algorithms and data structures. While fixed-length arrays offer predictable performance for random access (O(1)), they demand careful index management. Dynamic arrays and collections like `ArrayList` or `vector` enhance flexibility but introduce slight overhead. Mastery of array manipulation, edge case handling, and understanding trade-offs between arrays and linked structures is critical for writing efficient, bug-free code.
