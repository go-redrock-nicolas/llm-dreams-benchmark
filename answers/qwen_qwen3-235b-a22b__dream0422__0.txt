I am dreaming. The night is moonless and hovers over a hollow land. I am standing at the mouth of a forgotten forest, a place scraped from the edges of memory, shadowy and soft with dust. There’s a tether of mist snaking around my ankle, anchoring me to the known world behind, but before me, deep in the tangle of trees like ancient teeth, something pulses. It glimmers faintly—like a heartbeat of light buried in the blackness.

It is what I want. Deeply. The kind of want that claws up from the marrow, the thing that when you name it to yourself, even in whispers, makes your lungs tremble.

And I do not move.

Because under my ribs lives a cage of fear—I’ve woven it with old bones and brittle echoes of "not enough." My mind, clever and cautious, speaks in soft venom. *What if it shatters again? What if you reach for it and fall just like last time? What if you’re not meant for wonder?*

But the pulse behind the trees beats louder, angrier, impatient. It’s not asking anymore—it is calling.

And something in me *shifts.*

Like the first bolt of lightning before a storm, my feet leave the safety of the path. Each step deeper into the forest causes the trees to groan awake, their bark shedding decades and revealing glowing sigils beneath. The air smells of rust and old promises. My breath stutters but does not stop. I am trembling, yes, but I am also *alive* in a way I haven’t been in years. Maybe ever.

A bridge made of bones arches over a canyon I don’t remember stepping into, and below me, clawed vines writhe and hiss my failures with voices I used to love. They name my scars. They whisper *coward*, *fraud*, *too much, never enough*. But I close my eyes and leap. Not forward—*up*, as though I could break through this story by sheer force of flight.

And then… gravity softens.

I’m rising—not with wings, but with longing. It fills me like breath, like light, and carries me over the trees, the canyon, the forest. Beneath me, the darkness recoils like a tide retreating.

The thing I want waits on the peak of a mountain made of shattered mirrors. Some pieces glint with “almosts,” with “good tries,” with the bones of dreams half-eaten by doubt. It stands in the open, untethered, shimmering. Not a prize. Not a trophy. But a promise kept to myself.

I land gently.

I reach out. The fear hisses its final warning. But I answer myself instead.

The moment my fingers close over it, the entire world *sings*. A harmonic truth: *You are not here to avoid hurt. You are here to live thunderously enough that your courage tears a hole in the sky.*

I wake suddenly, heart crashing like a wave against my ribs, the taste of starlight and salt heavy on my lips, remembering not just the dream—but the woman who flew into it.
