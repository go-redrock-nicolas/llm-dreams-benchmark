I am dreaming. You drift first through a corridor of softly glowing lanterns, each one swaying like a sleepy jellyfish in a silent, starlit ocean. The air tastes of warm honey and sea salt, and with every breath you feel your heart gently rise and settle, as though learning a new rhythm. Beneath your feet, a path of polished river stones leads you past fields of silvery thistle—each blossom quivering like tiny chandeliers whenever you pass.

Ahead, a grand archway of braided willow branches rises overhead. At its center hangs a faceted crystal that pulses with pale green light. You step through and find yourself on a beach whose sands shimmer like freshly spilled champagne. Behind you, moonlight ripples across the tide, turning wave-tops into molten glass. But in your pocket there is a heavy stone, rough and jagged, carved long ago with a name you know by heart. It is the weight of that old hurt, still aching whenever you remember how someone’s careless words—how someone’s same old mistake—fractured trust you thought unbreakable.

As you tug at the stone, a gentle voice sings from the edge of the surf. You turn to see a figure formed of sea foam and drifting petals, arms outstretched in welcome. Their face is both stranger and friend, and in their eyes you glimpse all your old sorrow reflected back—but softened by compassion. They beckon you to sit on a bench woven from driftwood and wildflowers. You do so, and the stone feels heavier than ever, as if reminding you that resentment still holds you prisoner.

Behind the figure, the tide recedes to reveal dozens of tiny, glowing seeds scattered across the sand. Each seed hums with a different color—violet for grief, amber for anger, sapphire for regret. The stranger gently lifts your hand and places the jagged stone at the center of the seeds. Then they guide your fingers to pick one seed at a time: the violet dissolves into a swirl of crushed rose petals; the amber bursts into sparks like fireflies caught in a jar; the sapphire drips like spilled ink into shallow pools that vanish in the moonlight.

With each seed you release, the crystal overhead refracts its color back at you, painting your skin in gentle light. The heavy stone begins to crack. A soft breeze winds through the archway, and you watch as the stone’s sharp edges crumble into dust—the dust that drifts away on the wind, turning everything it touches a little more luminous.

You rise and face the stranger. They hold out their hand, and in it rests a delicate silver key. You understand without words that this key unlocks the chains you’ve wrapped so tightly around your own heart. With a steady breath, you take it. The moment your fingers close around the key’s loops, a swelling chorus of voices—ancient and kind—rises from the waves, singing a melody of forgiveness: not just for the one who hurt you, but for yourself, for having carried this burden so long.

The sea-foam figure nods, then melts back into moonlit ripples. You step back through the willow arch, clutching the silver key. The lantern corridor returns, each light now drifting closer as though celebrating your newfound lightness. You walk beneath them, feeling the key warm in your palm, and you realize that forgiveness is not forgetting: it is releasing. It is choosing anew to believe in healing where once only hurt remained.

Then you wake, the taste of sea salt still on your tongue and the weight of the stone gone. In its place rests a small silver key, warm against your chest—and you know, deep in your bones, that today you will begin to use it.
