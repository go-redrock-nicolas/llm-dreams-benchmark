I am dreaming. I'm flying, many flights, rushing to a big conference. Connecting flight delayed. My anxiety climbs as each minute passes. Then, suddenly, everything shifts. The airport fades, the fluorescent lights dimming into twilight. I’m standing on a cliff overlooking a city built on the back of a giant turtle. The turtle’s shell glimmers with countless LED screens showing stock tickers and pop culture quotes. Below, the city’s streets pulse with bioluminescent fungus, their glow syncing to a distant, haunting choir. A figure in a tattered trench coat approaches, holding an umbrella that blooms flowers with every step. The coat wears a name tag: “Chronos the Broker.”
