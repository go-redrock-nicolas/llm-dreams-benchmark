I am dreaming. The air hangs thick and heavy, scented not with rain or flowers, but with something indefinable, like forgotten melodies and the dust of slumbering attics. I stand on a street paved with cobblestones that gleam like polished obsidian under a sky ablaze with colours I've never witnessed awake – deep indigos bleeding into bruised oranges, threaded with veins of incandescent violet. The light is peculiar, casting long, dancing shadows from buildings that lean at impossible angles, their windows dark and expressionless as vacant eyes. There's a profound silence, yet it feels expectant, as if the world is holding its breath.

My gaze drifts downwards, drawn inexplicably to a small object nestled between the slick stones near a wrought-iron fence tangled with colourless, papery vines. It's nothing remarkable, merely a button. A simple, unassuming button, likely fallen from a coat or a shirt. It's made of dark, perhaps horn-like material, slightly worn around the edges, with four neat holes in its centre. Ordinary. Mundane. Insignificant.

And yet... as my eyes fix upon it, a wave washes over me, sudden and immense, an oceanic surge of feeling that steals my breath and makes my chest ache with an almost unbearable pressure. It isn't sadness exactly, nor joy, but a profound, heart-wrenching **poignancy**. Tears prickle unexpectedly, hot and stinging, blurring the already surreal scene into a kaleidoscope of light and shadow. My breath hitches, snagging on a sob I don't understand the origin of.

This tiny, lost button suddenly feels like the epicenter of all loneliness, the distilled essence of every small, unnoticed loss the universe has ever endured. Why? I have no connection to it, no memory associated with such an object that could warrant this tidal wave of emotion. Awake, I would likely step over it without a second glance. But here, in the strange logic of the dreamscape, it holds an almost sacred weight.

I find myself kneeling on the cool, damp cobblestones, the strange twilight air swirling around me. My focus narrows entirely onto the button. Each scratch on its surface seems like a scar telling a silent story. The four little holes feel like portals into a vast emptiness, a testament to its separation from the fabric it once belonged to, the purpose it once served. It feels desperately, cosmically *alone*, adrift in this silent, violet-lit street.

And this feeling isn't just *about* the button; it floods *me*. I feel its perceived isolation as if it were my own. My fingers tremble as I reach out, hovering just above its surface. I hesitate to touch it, afraid that contact might shatter the fragile intensity of this moment, or perhaps afraid that the overwhelming feeling might somehow swallow me whole. The sensitivity is bewildering. It’s as if the usual filters of my waking mind have dissolved, leaving my core exposed to the raw, untranslated emotional frequency of existence itself, triggered by the most commonplace of objects. The weight of this single, lost button feels heavier than any worldly burden, a tiny anchor holding down an ocean of inexplicable sorrow and empathy within the heart of this vivid, perplexing dream.
