I am dreaming. At first, there is only darkness—a void without shape or sound, but it is neither empty nor silent. Within its depths, a slow, rhythmic pulse hums, like the heartbeat of the universe itself. Then, without transition, I am standing in a vast, shifting landscape woven from liquid gold and twilight. The ground beneath my feet ripples like molten glass, reflecting shifting constellations that whisper secrets as they drift by. I realize that each footstep changes their arrangement—my every motion sends waves through the fabric of time.

To my left, a forest stretches into infinity—its trees are towering pillars of jagged crystal, each one humming in a different pitch, resonating with the echoes of past and future. A breeze carries voices, fragmented laughter from childhood mixing with conversations I have yet to have. Time here is thick and slow, dripping like honey. Seconds stretch into minutes, minutes into eons, and I watch as the leaves of the nearest tree unfurl slowly, revealing intricate scenes from forgotten memories. 

But when I run, time contracts violently. The world blurs into streaks of light and shadow, moments collapsing into each other like folds in a dream. I sprint past faces I recognize—some from long ago, some unknown but familiar—their features melting as I outrun their time. My heartbeat accelerates, and with it, the universe accelerates too, spinning into chaos. 

A figure appears in the distance—an ancient one, their form shifting between countless possibilities. A child, a crone, a star, a shadow. They extend a hand, and suddenly, everything halts. The humming pulses in harmony with their breath. 

"Time," they murmur, their voice both inside and outside my mind, "is not a river. It is the breath of all things."

Then, I am falling. 

The stars rush past, turning into streaks of silver, and the sensation is not of descent but of expansion. I scatter into fragments of myself, scattered across eras—I am a child laughing under a summer sun, I am old and watching the last embers of a dying fire, I am unborn, waiting in a realm of hushed whispers. 

With a gasp, I snap awake—but for a lingering moment, the echoes of the dream remain. The clock ticks unnaturally slowly. A bird outside hangs suspended mid-flight. The air thrums with latent possibility.

And I wonder: was I truly asleep? Or merely shifting between breaths of time?
