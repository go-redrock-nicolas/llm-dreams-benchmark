I am dreaming.

I find myself drifting through an immense cathedral of stars, the architecture woven from both light and memory. Each footstep resounds with the music of distant planets. As I move, silvery rivers of empathy well up within me, flowing outward in glimmering streams. I encounter faces suspended in nimbus clouds—people whose choices once confounded me, whose actions I had met with anger or cold dismissal. Now, their expressions radiate complexity: a tapestry of past wounds and secret hopes, confusion, and quiet wisdom.

A woman I once scorned sits by a glowing pool, her eyes rimmed with fatigue. I kneel beside her, and without speaking, I understand—her harsh words had grown from seeds of fear, watered by loneliness. My heart swells with gentle sorrow, and as if conjured by thought, the pool reflects not only her, but fragments of her memories, mingling with my own.

A man, his shadow tangled with regret, stands before a doorway of swirling mist. In waking life, I would have locked that portal against him. Yet now, warmth rises in my chest—a vibrant, honey-colored compassion. I see how, under the peeling layers of his choices, beats a heart crippled by an ancient longing for acceptance.

With every meeting in this strange, lucid realm, I gather more understanding into my sunlit vessel. The boundaries between “us” and “them” dissolve like frost in morning light. I reach out, feeling luminous threads binding us in our shared, trembling humanity.

More than forgiveness, more than sympathy—my empathy is an endless, shimmering river. I touch their hands, and all at once, I see the painful beauty of being flawed, of trying and failing and yearning to be understood. I am both myself and everyone else, woven into a cosmic quilt: a dream where compassion pours through me into all the broken, beautiful souls I once could not comprehend.

And in the gleaming hush of this dream, I awaken to the possibility that this empathy might one day cross the threshold into waking life, changing everything.
