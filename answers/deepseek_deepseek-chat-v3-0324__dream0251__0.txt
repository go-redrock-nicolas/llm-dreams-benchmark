I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and nervous sweat, the kind that clings to the back of your throat. The walls of the conference room stretch unnaturally high, their surfaces shifting between polished mahogany and rough, splintered wood, as if the room itself can’t decide whether it’s a place of prestige or ruin.  

My notes—once crisp and meticulously organized—are now a writhing mass of ink-stained parchment, the words melting and reforming into nonsensical scribbles. The more I try to smooth them out, the faster they twist away, sentences unraveling like frightened snakes. The faces of the audience flicker in and out of focus—sometimes they’re colleagues, their expressions frozen in polite masks of judgment; other times, they’re featureless, just hollow voids drinking in my panic.  

A clock on the wall ticks, but the hands don’t move. Instead, the sound grows louder, each *tick* reverberating through my ribs like a mallet striking a gong. My heartbeat syncs with it, erratic and deafening. I open my mouth to speak, but my voice is gone—only a dry, crackling whisper escapes, dissolving before it reaches anyone’s ears.  

Then, the floor beneath me softens. The carpet turns to sand, then to water, and I’m sinking. The presentation slides projected behind me warp into grotesque, leering caricatures of my own face, mocking me in a chorus of distorted laughter. The edges of the room begin to fray, peeling away like burnt film, revealing an endless void beyond.  

Just as the darkness threatens to swallow me whole, I jolt awake—but for a single, paralyzing moment, I’m not sure if I’ve truly escaped the dream, or if this waking world is just another layer of it.
