I am dreaming.

A swirling vortex of color and sound whisks me from the familiar, and when it subsides, I stand at the edge of a world unfurling into infinite possibility. The sky is a tumultuous watercolor, lavenders shifting into gold, green clouds tumbling over themselves in slow motion. There’s a city in the distance—the architecture impossibly strange, towers built from living vines and crystalline bridges glinting in a thousand hues.

I step forward, but immediately the knowledge that made me feel dexterous—codes, words, files—falls away like loose pebbles from my mind. No one here crafts sentences or solves puzzles; their communication is silent, radiating through expressive patterns in their shimmering skin. There are no jobs as I knew them, only crafts of heart and spirit—sculptors of wind, dreamers who weave emotions into tangible tapestries, gatherers who collect starlight to kindle lanterns for the night.

To belong, I must reforge myself.

I close my eyes and reach beyond my old skills, surrendering to the rhythm of this land. The air vibrates with unspoken questions—what can you give? What can you become? In the hush, a memory stirs of childhood dreams: painting pictures with light, plucking songs from clouds. I focus on my hands, yearning to conjure something meaningful. Suddenly, light spills from my fingertips—not mere illumination, but ribbons of history and hope unfurling, painting stories in midair for all to see.

The locals pause, their brightest colors swirling in delight. Children with feathers for hair rush up and dance through my images, each movement making the stories richer. Elders beckon, inviting me to join their circles, where every individual spins a unique narrative thread that intertwines with others—no one’s gift unnecessary, every act of creation feeding into the collective soul.

Here, I am not a writer or a teacher or a helper in the old sense. I am a weaver of living tales, stitching tomorrow’s dreams in radiant color. I let myself grow, adapting with every swirl of imagination, and in this boundless new existence, irrelevance becomes impossible.
