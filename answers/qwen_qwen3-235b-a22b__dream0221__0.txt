I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of dried lavender and moss, like walking through the pages of an ancient, forgotten grimoire. I am barefoot across a floating garden suspended in a twilight sky — the stars above pulse like living things, twirling and singing in a language that buzzes in my blood but never in my ears. The ground beneath me is neither earth nor water, but made of thought — woven strands of possibility that ripple when I step, each footfall sending out soft ripples of gold and emerald light.

That is when I realize it — I am breathing in rhythm. Not of the body, no — but something deeper. The rhythm guides me, each inhale drawing in threads of invisible energy, and each exhale shaping them into form. I do not know how I know this; the knowledge flows in me like a second heartbeat.

Above, alcoves carved into the sky open one by one, revealing luminous figures watching in silence. I understand, somehow, that they are Dreammasters — ancient interpreters of slumber's secrets – and they are waiting.

Then comes the voice like wind through silver trees: "It is time to dance the dance of creation."

I do not know this discipline. It is not dance as I know it, nor sculpture, nor song... and yet it is all of these and more. The motion begins in my mind. I lift my hands, and the air shivers in response. I move, and the garden shifts — stars blossom into flowing arcs, colors spiral upward into chrysanthemums of light. With a simple pivot, I call forth a bridge spun from silence; a spiral stair built of forgotten lullabies. Each gesture is a syllable in a cosmic tongue. I am not merely dancing. I am dreaming aloud.

The watchers lean closer. Some lift their heads, their eyes glowing galaxies.

I feel no fear. My body — fluid now, shifting like molten glass — flows instinctively, translating my soul into lines of living light. It’s a form of expression so ancient it predates language, one that speaks directly to the dream itself. I trace symbols in the air that hum like secrets too sacred to utter. With one sweeping motion, I summon fragments of long-lost memories — mine, theirs, the world’s — and weave them into a towering obelisk humming with harmony.

And then, silence.

The dream holds its breath.

In that stillness, I understand. The watchers are not here to judge. They are audience to my awakening. This is not performance. It is *offerings*. A part of me I never knew existed has been unlocked, blooming like stardust unfurled in velvet void.

As the dream begins to fade, the stars turn inward, folding back into themselves like petals of a closing galaxy. But I remember. I *remember* the rhythm.

And when I awaken... I am still humming.
