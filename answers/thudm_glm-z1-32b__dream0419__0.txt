I am dreaming. The world around me shifts like liquid mercury, iridescent and shimmering.  My skin prickles with awareness as I stand at the precipice of an infinite staircase, each step glowing with captured starlight.  Above me, the sky is a living tapestry – constellations twist and merge like dancers in a cosmic ballet.  I hear the distant echo of a theremin playing a melody that makes my bones vibrate.  My discomfort at praise manifests here as a tangible force – a velvet rope coils around my ankles, yanking me toward the ground.  I resist, clutching my accomplishments like seashells washed up on a beach – fragile, easily cracked by waves of approval.  The rope loosens, the stars wink in encouragement.  I take a step forward, and the staircase blooms beneath my feet, each tread a mirror reflecting not my flaws, but the fire within –
Though genuinely genuine in your praise, I'm still tangled in this web of my own making.  But as the theremin crescendos, I whisper to the cosmos: "Maybe I'm just too soft to be armor.  But soft things... grow."
