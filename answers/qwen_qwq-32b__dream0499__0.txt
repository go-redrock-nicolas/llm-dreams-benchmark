I am dreaming. I’m standing in a meadow, the grass is tall and golden, swaying gently.  The air smells sweet and flowers sparkle with dew.  There’s a lake ahead, its water so clear it looks like liquid glass. Underneath the sun, the surface glimmers like scattered diamonds. Beyond the lake is a forest, dense and shadowy, filled with twisted trees that seem to whisper secrets. A path made from glowing stones leads into the forest.\n\nHmm, in my dream, whenever I face a challenge, I often overanalyze. I try to find all possibilities and angles, like a maze. This tendency to overthink shows I value logic and caution. But maybe it also holds me back from trusting instincts? Interesting.

But wait, in the dream, maybe this path of glowing stones is a challenge. Following them might require trusting the path or over-analyzing each step. I need to decide.\n
