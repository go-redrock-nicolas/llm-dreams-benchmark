I am dreaming. In the dream, I'm seated at a glossy conference table that stretches infinitely in both directions—its surface like liquid obsidian that ripples gently with my breath. Around me, a shifting constellation of faces flicker in and out of focus. Some have the golden eyes of lions, others the iridescent scales of fish, and behind them all, geometric patterns emerge, spelling out words in alphabets I’ve never seen but somehow understand. 

Suddenly, I speak, but each tongue unfurls separately—I’m speaking Mandarin, Arabic, Swahili, Russian, French, Spanish, and a seventh language I've never heard before—round, molten syllables that shape themselves like liquid mercury in my mouth. The air vibrates as my languages manifest physically—Chinese characters curl like smoke from my lips, Arabic calligraphy spirals from my fingertips, and French poetry glistens from my exhale before crystallizing midair.  

In response, the faces around me begin reciting poetry—simultaneously in all of them. Their words mesh into a cascading symphony of sound, but as I strain to translate, I realize they're all saying the same thing: "The world is made of words. Translate it right, and you can change the fabric of reality."  

A great trembling overtakes the table, and beneath it, dark water stirs. I look down and see my reflection—except it’s not my face. It’s the Earth itself, staring back at me. The oceans whisper in my sixth language. The continents flex like living skin. Then, before I can respond, the water rises—but instead of drowning me, it absorbs me, dissolving my flesh into ink, and I wake up gasping, still tasting the words lingering like honey on my tongue. 

What happens next in the dream? (The scene continues vividly—)
