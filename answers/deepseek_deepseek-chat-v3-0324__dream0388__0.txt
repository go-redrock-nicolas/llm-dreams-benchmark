I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds: A Public Reckoning**  

I stand beneath a colossal sky—indigo and swirling with constellations shaped like eyes. The air hums, thick with the scent of burnt sage and anticipation. Around me, a faceless crowd gathers, their forms blurred yet palpably expectant. At my feet, a mosaic of mirrors reflects fractured versions of myself, each whispering contradictions I’ve sworn by for years.  

Then, the Revelation crashes in: an enormous, pulsing orb of light descends, and inside it—crystalline and undeniable—is the truth I’ve resisted. Graphs, voices, timelines, and emotions coalesce into a single, irrefutable proof. The thing I championed, fought for, staked my reputation on… was wrong.  

A murmur ripples through the crowd. The mirrors at my feet shatter, and in their shards, I see my own face morph—defiance, shock, and then something raw. The crowd’s whispers sharpen: *"Admit it."* The ground quivers; the sky’s eyelid constellations blink in sync.  

I step forward. My voice, when it comes, isn’t the polished boom of a lecturer but the scratch of a child’s chalk on slate. **"I was mistaken."** The words glow as they leave my lips, searing through the dream like a comet. The crowd doesn’t erupt in jeers but sighs—a collective exhale. The orb of light dissolves into fireflies, alighting on shoulders, mine included. The weight of being wrong doesn’t crush me; it unravels me, thread by thread, until I’m nothing but open air.  

Then—laughing. Mine? Theirs? The dream doesn’t distinguish. The mirrors reform, now showing not my face but hands offering to pull me up.  

I wake just as my fingers brush theirs, the taste of humility like honey and ash on my tongue.
