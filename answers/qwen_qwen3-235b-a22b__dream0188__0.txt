I am dreaming. I am dreaming in technicolor fractals.

At first, I am standing in a coral canyon beneath an ocean the color of ink and stardust. The water pulses with bioluminescence like thoughts spiraling through a conscious void. In one moment, I am painting the coral with a brush made of moonlight, dripping pigments that sing in low, harmonic tones as they touch the reef. Each stroke is a chord, and every color corresponds with a note in a vast underwater symphony. My artistic mind is feverishly alive, translating the pulse of dreaming tides into flowing compositions. The coral responds to my vision, blossoming like underwater flowers between heartbeats.

Then my gaze snaps upward—away from brushstroke and pigment—and to a spiral shell rising from the seabed like an ancient watchtower. Now logic commands me. I tread water in the alien tides, observing patterns in the currents, measuring the rhythm of the ocean’s electrical pulses. The shell speaks in coded sequences. I must decode them. Each number and shape I untangle opens a door in my mind. I weave algorithms from sealant pearls resting at my feet, cast equations into constellations. The logical portion of my psyche snaps into place like a master craftsman assembling gears from the bones of cetaceans, all while suspended between Archimedean spirals and Fibonacci flows. Solutions rise like foam—transient, yet precise.

Just as the code begins to bore and my conscious ego returns, gravity flips.

I fly, not as a bird, but as a whisper. The atmosphere is warm honey, golden and thick with emotions dripping from the air like ripe fruit. My heart becomes a compass. I drift through a city sculpted from memory—buildings made of laughter, alleyways painted in the quiet aftermath of silent tears. Now emotion guides me. I listen without ears, observe without eyes. I pass a widow tending a garden of forgotten names, and I understand her grief simply by breathing it in. I meet a child juggling fireflies near an electrified willow tree, and my chest flutters from the shared joy. The emotional axis of my dreaming self breathes empathy into every exchange, bridging souls across time and temperature.

And here’s the miracle: I switch. From artist to analyst to empath, again and again—quickly as thought flickers across a dreamer’s brainstem.

In one second, I’m sculpting koi fish from the reflection of a humming galaxy. The next, I’m calculating how much mass would be needed to fold space into a bridge across centuries. Then, I'm hugging strangers on the wind, exchanging momentary understandings without the need of language.

My dreambody becomes a prism, refracting thought, feeling, and vision into the same spectrum. I feel no conflict between these modes—they are like instruments in the same orchestra, playing variations on the same heartbeat.

This is the dream: a universe inside me, ever-shifting, where logic dances with emotion and art stitches them both into meaning. I wake trembling slightly, as though I emerged from some deep and sacred sea—wet with the ink of forgotten colors and humming with a melody that almost remembered my name.
