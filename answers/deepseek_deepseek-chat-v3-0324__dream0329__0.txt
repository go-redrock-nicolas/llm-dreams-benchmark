I am dreaming. **Dream Journal: The Labyrinth of Broken Mirrors**  

I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt sugar and wet ink, thick enough to taste. Above me, the sky is a cracked mirror—shards of twilight reflecting endless versions of myself, each a slightly distorted echo: a soldier, a thief, a saint, a liar. I stand at the mouth of a labyrinth, its walls made not of stone but of towering, leather-bound books, their spines whispering secrets in languages I almost understand.  

A voice—mine, but not mine—hisses from the pages. *"They’ll call you a traitor if you act. They’ll call you a coward if you don’t."*  

Before me, two paths shimmer like mirages:  
1. **The Gilded Road**—paved with official seals and the cold, precise handwriting of rules I’ve spent years memorizing. At its end, a door stands open, revealing a council of faceless figures. Their verdict is already etched into the air: *"You followed procedure. No one can blame you."* But the weight of it strangles my lungs.  
2. **The Thorned Passage**—a snarled tunnel of black vines, wet with something dark that isn’t quite blood. Here, the walls pulse with muffled cries. A child’s voice, raw with terror, sobs, *"You’re the only one who knows. You’re the only one who can."* The rules say to wait for orders. The rules say this isn’t your duty. The child doesn’t care about rules.  

I reach for the thorns—and they bite back. The pain is exquisite, each puncture flooding my veins with memories:  
- A hospital hallway where I turned left instead of right because protocol demanded it. Someone died screaming behind the door I didn’t open.  
- A courtroom where I raised my hand and swore oaths I no longer believe. The gavel’s crack still echoes in my molars.  

The labyrinth groans, shelves collapsing into rivers of melting text. The ink bleeds upward, staining the mirrored sky until my reflections fracture into a thousand glass storms. One shard slices my palm—I gasp—and the blood writes its own verdict on the walls:  

*"To choose is to lose. To act is to betray. To hesitate is to murder."*  

A shadow peels itself from the books. It wears my face, but its eyes are hollowed out, filled with swarmfire bees. It kisses my forehead and murmurs, *"Wake up. The child is still screaming. The council is still waiting. And you—you are always in between."*  

I jolt upright.  
The dream clings like a second skin.  
The choice remains.
