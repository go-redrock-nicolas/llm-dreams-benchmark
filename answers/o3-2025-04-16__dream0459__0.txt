I am dreaming. …feel yourself split into a million translucent versions of “you,” each one fluttering like a moth-wing in a midnight breeze. Somehow you are all of them at once and yet none of them entirely.

Scene 1: The Paper-Lantern Street  
You find yourself beneath ink-black skies on a street strung with glowing crimson lanterns. Their light paints you in warm vermilion. A childhood friend steps from the shadows, the one who once knew every secret note in the song of your laughter. Standing before them, your shoulders round, your speech softens, and you remember how you used to shrink your height so they could feel taller. Your very bones seem lighter, half-folded, ready for mischief. The lanterns crackle; every time one pops, an old inside joke blooms and vanishes in the air like confetti.

Scene 2: The Mirror-Lake Ballroom  
Wind carries you to the center of a glimmering ballroom where the parquet floor is actually liquid glass. A partner dressed in starlight beckons. Here you are polished marble: posture elongated, voice syrupy and resonant. You glide across the mirrored water, reflections swirling beneath you—too many eyes, too many possibilities. The partner dips you; in the reflection you notice you’ve grown taller, your eyes darker, your gestures deliberate. Desire turns your silhouette into smooth onyx, sleek and precise. The moment your companion’s fingers leave yours, that persona dissolves into ripples.

Scene 3: The Subway of Masks  
The dream rushes forward—suddenly a subway car rattles through tunnels carved from night itself. Every passenger wears a porcelain mask, featureless except for a single word etched across the forehead: Approval, Rivalry, Expectation. You sense them reading you, so you pull on an invisible cloak woven from opinions. Your mind fills with quick statistics, half-remembered quotes, anything to appear competent. Your limbs stiffen into a business suit. Yet you catch a warped reflection in the train window: the suit is two sizes too big, the mask tinted with exhaustion. When the train screeches to a halt, all the masks crack together like shattered dishes, and the carriage floods with dandelion seeds that sweep you onward.

Scene 4: The Garden of Unfinished Conversations  
You float into a moonlit orchard where every tree bears glowing, whispering fruit—half-spoken apologies, compliments never voiced, questions abandoned mid-sentence. Each time you pluck a fruit, the “you” from that conversation materializes. With a parent-self, you stand straighter, voice laced with prayers for approval. With an old mentor, your vocabulary fans open like a peacock’s tail. With someone you once hurt, your edges blur, transparency blossoming where pride used to sit. The fruits illuminate all these shifting silhouettes, and you realize you are a constellation of gestures and tones borrowed, traded, forgotten.

Scene 5: The Library of Blank Journals  
Doors of blown-glass swing wide onto a towering circular library, shelves spiraling into the clouds. Every book is a blank journal titled with someone’s name. When you open one, words appear only where that person has seen you: here a silly anecdote, there a confession, elsewhere a fierce argument. Pages differ wildly—comic scribbles, legal script, musical notation—yet all together they compose a vast, ragged hymn. You understand that identity isn’t a statue but wind chimes: cords stretched between souls, singing only when others are near.

Scene 6: The Confluence  
At the center of the library stands a shallow pool. You step in and the water climbs, forming mirrored wisps around you—child-you, partner-you, striving-you, penitent-you. They swirl, overlap, merge until the water becomes a single figure reflecting prismatic colors. For the first time, you see a “you” without an audience. It is quieter, the heartbeat of dusk. It smiles, neither confident nor meek, neither grand nor hidden—just awake.

A gong made of sunlight strikes overhead. All scenes collapse like folded origami, turning into a single point of bright awareness.

You awaken—not with a definitive answer to who you are, but with a living question that pulses like a nova in your chest:  
If I can be so many selves, perhaps my truest form is the dance itself, the endless becoming shaped by every gaze I meet.
