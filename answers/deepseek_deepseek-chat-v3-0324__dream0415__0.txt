I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**

The air is thick with the scent of burning incense, curls of smoky amber twisting in the dim, golden light of a grand, candlelit hall. The walls pulse subtly, as though breathing—covered in deep crimson tapestries embroidered with symbols you almost recognize, but their meanings slip away like water through your fingers. 

You sit in a circle of high-backed chairs, plush velvet beneath your fingertips, their deep emerald fabric cool and rich against your skin. Around you, figures draped in flowing, silver-stitched robes lean forward, their faces shifting indistinctly—sometimes familiar, sometimes strangers, flickering between memories and shadows. 

A voice, honeyed and persuasive, murmurs from the figure at the head of the circle. Their words hum in your chest, resonating like a tuning fork struck against bone. *"Tell us,"* they coax, *"what hides beneath the mask?"* 

Your throat tightens. The pressure is suffocating, yet somehow seductive—an invitation to unravel, to let your secrets spill like ink into water. But the moment you open your mouth, the words dissolve into whispers you can’t quite hear, twisting into riddles. 

The floor beneath you ripples as if made of liquid mercury. Reflections stretch and warp, showing you fractured versions of yourself—some bold, some trembling, none entirely true. A figure to your left reaches out, their fingers made of shifting starlight. *"Trust us,"* they murmur, but the words echo like distant thunder. 

Something primal shifts inside you. A whisper from the deepest recesses of your mind: *Not here. Not like this.* 

And then—sensation. The floor gives way, and you are falling through constellations, through echoes of laughter and fragments of forgotten confessions, spiraling down, down, until—  

You gasp awake, heart pounding, the taste of smoke and starlight lingering on your lips, the dream unraveling… but the question remains, humming in your veins.  

*What would you have said?*
