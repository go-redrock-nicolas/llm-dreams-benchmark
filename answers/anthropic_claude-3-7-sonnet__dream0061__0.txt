I am dreaming. # The Unfinished Symphony

I stand at the podium, heart thundering against my ribcage like a trapped bird. The auditorium stretches before me—cavernous and imposing with its high ceilings that seem to collect shadows. Row upon row of the world's foremost minds in my field sit expectantly, their faces simultaneously distinct yet blurring together into a sea of critical gazes.

The leather portfolio containing fifteen years of my research feels unnaturally heavy in my trembling hands. This presentation represents everything—every late night, every sacrifice, every relationship strained or broken by my singular devotion to this work.

As I open the portfolio, time seems to stretch like taffy. The familiar pages look suddenly foreign. Where there should be my meticulous data tables, there are strange symbols I've never seen. Equations dissolve and reform before my eyes, their variables morphing into hieroglyphics. My carefully constructed graphs now depict impossible geometries that hurt my eyes to follow.

"Whenever you're ready," says the committee chair, her voice somehow both distant and uncomfortably close, as if speaking directly into my ear from across the room.

I shuffle through the papers, panic rising. Between the corrupted pages, I find childhood drawings, old love letters, and grocery lists from decades ago. A photograph slips out—showing me standing beside someone whose face is blurred, in a place I've never been but somehow recognize with bone-deep familiarity.

The audience begins to murmur. I look up to explain, but discover the auditorium has subtly changed. The ceiling now opens to a twilight sky where impossible constellations wheel and dance. Some audience members have been replaced by figures from my past—my first grade teacher, an old neighbor who disappeared years ago, a college friend who died too young.

In the front row sits my younger self, watching with curious, untroubled eyes.

"Begin," commands the committee chair, who now wears my mother's face but speaks with my father's voice.

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, a complex melody emerges—a song I've never heard yet know by heart, like something remembered from before birth...
