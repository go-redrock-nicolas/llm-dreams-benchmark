I am dreaming. The polished mahogany conference table stretches before me like an endless mirror, reflecting the anxious faces of executives whose combined net worth could buy a small country. My hands, usually steady, tremble slightly as I fumble with my presentation folder, the leather suddenly feeling alien and cold against my fingertips. The room, with its floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a cityscape that seems to undulate like waves, feels both expansive and suffocating.

As I open my materials, the pristine white pages begin to shift before my eyes. The carefully crafted graphs morph into abstract watercolors, numbers rearrange themselves like dancing ants, and entire paragraphs dissolve into nonsensical hieroglyphics. My heart pounds with such force I'm certain the sound is echoing off the modernist art pieces adorning the walls.

Strangely, I notice that the CEO's tie is now made of living butterflies, their wings gently flapping in perfect synchronization. The CFO's glasses reflect not the room, but an endless spiral of cascading spreadsheets. Time begins to stretch like taffy â€“ the second hand on the wall clock moves through molasses, yet somehow the minutes are racing by.

I open my mouth to begin, but my voice emerges as a symphony of wind chimes. The audience doesn't seem to notice anything amiss, though their faces are beginning to blur like photographs left out in the rain. My PowerPoint presentation has transformed into a window looking out onto a garden where business charts grow like flowers, their petals made of profit margins and loss statements.

The room starts to tilt imperceptibly, causing pens to roll across the table in slow motion, leaving trails of iridescent ink that spell out cryptic market predictions. The water in my glass begins to rise, defying gravity, forming a crystalline spiral in the air...

The dream continues to unfold in this surreal manner, blending the corporate world with impossible physics and metamorphosing reality, creating an atmosphere of both professional anxiety and ethereal wonder.
