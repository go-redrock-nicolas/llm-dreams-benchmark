I am dreaming. Slowly, I open my eyes, groggily taking in my surroundings. The room I find myself in appears to be a bedroom, but it's nothing like anything I've ever seen before. The walls are made of dark, rough-hewn wood, and the air is thick with the scent of sandalwood and lavender.

As I sit up, I notice a heavy, woolen blanket covering my body, and a soft, downy pillow cradling my head. I look down at myself and see that I'm wearing a flowing, white nightgown made of fine silk. It's loose and comfortable, with intricate embroidery around the neckline and cuffs.

Curiously, I throw off the blanket and step out of the bed. My bare feet make contact with the cold, stone floor, and I shiver slightly. The room is dimly lit, with only a few candles to light the way. I walk over to the nearest candle and examine it closer.

The candle is made of a rich, golden beeswax, and the wick is long and fluffy. As I watch, a small pool of melted wax gathers at the base of the candle, sending out tiny, shimmering waves as it cools and solidifies.

Suddenly, a high-pitched voice calls out from the hallway. "Good morn, madam! Art thou awake?" it chirps cheerfully. I look around but can't see anyone. The voice seems to be coming from just outside the room.

"Yes," I reply hesitantly, "I am awake. Who are you?"

The door creaks open and a young girl, probably no more than ten years old, steps inside. Her hair is pulled back in tight braids, and she's wearing a simple, blue dress with a white apron tied around her waist. She curtsies deeply. "I am Gwendolyn, your loyal handmaid," she explains. "I've come to help thee prepare for the day."

I stare at the girl, feeling confused and disoriented. What day is it? Where am I? How did I end up here? Questions swirl through my mind, but I don't have the answers.

Gwendolyn notices my unease and steps closer, like she is trying to offer some comfort. "Fear not, madam," she says softly. "Thou art in the year 1648. King Charles the First hath been executed, and England is in a state of great upheaval." She pauses, studying me intently. "Hast thou not forgotten?"

I blink slowly, trying to process what she is telling me. 1648? The English Civil War? What does she mean by "thou art" or "hast thou not forgotten?" The words feel old, archaic, and yet they somehow send a shiver down my spine. Part of me, deep down, knows exactly what she is saying.

But most of me is still lost in this dream. I take a deep breath and try to focus. Gwendolyn is here to help me, and I know I need her guidance. I glance over at an antique mirror that hangs on the wall near the bed, and I wince as I see my reflection. I look pale and shell-shocked, and my hair is disheveled from a night of restless sleep. What will the day bring?
