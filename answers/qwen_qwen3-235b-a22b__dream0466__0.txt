I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, a cloying sweetness that clings to the back of your throat. You stand at the edge of a city that is not a city—skyscrapers melt like wax, their glass facades dripping into rivers of liquid light that pool in the streets below. The pavement beneath your feet shimmers, shifting between cobblestones, desert sand, and the iridescent scales of some unseen leviathan. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of fractured time: a crescent moon hovers beside a blood-orange sun, while constellations blink in and out of existence like the static of forgotten memories.  

You are lost, but not alone. Shadows move in the periphery—figures with faces like smudged charcoal, their whispers threading through the air like spider silk. *“You’ve done this before,”* they hiss, their voices overlapping in a dissonant chorus. *“Why does this one feel different?”* You clutch your chest, feeling the erratic rhythm of your heart, a hummingbird trapped in a cage of ribs. The weight of their words presses down, a suffocating fog. You *have* survived change before: cities rebuilt from ashes, oceans crossed, identities shed like old skin. But this… this feels like drowning in slow motion, like your bones are filling with sand.  

A door materializes ahead, floating in midair, its surface a warped mirror reflecting versions of yourself you don’t recognize—a child with storm clouds for hair, an old woman with galaxies in her eyes, a stranger with your face laughing beside people you’ve never met. You reach for the handle, but the ground cracks open, swallowing the door whole. Below, a labyrinth of roots twists into view, glowing faintly with bioluminescent veins. A voice rumbles from the earth, deep and patient: *“You cannot outrun the shifting. You must grow through it.”*  

You descend, climbing into the roots, their texture like velvet-covered stone. The deeper you go, the louder the whispers become—a cacophony of regrets, half-formed plans, and the echo of a question you’ve avoided for years: *“What if you’re not meant to survive this unchanged?”* At the labyrinth’s heart, you find a tree. Its trunk is hollow, its branches cradling a single fruit that pulses like a beating heart. Inside the hollow, a figure sits—a younger version of yourself, eyes closed, humming a lullaby that once soothed you through storms.  

“You’re afraid,” the child says without opening their eyes. “Not of the change. Of who you’ll become *because* of it.”  

The fruit trembles, then bursts, scattering seeds that ignite into fireflies as they hit the ground. Each one carries a memory: a goodbye that carved you open, a risk that paid off in blood and gold, a moment of surrender that felt like betrayal. You see them not as scars, but as stitches—rough, necessary, proof of a body and mind that adapt, even when they resist.  

The labyrinth dissolves. You wake tangled in sheets, the taste of honey and ash still on your tongue. The dream lingers, not as a warning, but a reminder: transitions are not failures. They are the earth turning beneath your feet, demanding you learn to dance on uneven ground.  

And somewhere, deep in the roots, the tree blooms again.
