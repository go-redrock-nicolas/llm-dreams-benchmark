I am dreaming. The city rises in concentric circles, a vast terraced amphitheater carved from luminescent jade and obsidian. I know instinctively that each level signifies status—the higher one dwells, the more influence they possess. My home sits precisely in the middle ring, a position of respectable mediocrity. The air smells of cinnamon and ozone.

Everyone wears elaborate collars that shift colors according to mood, lineage, and social debt. Mine glows a muted teal with silver threads, marking me as a Knowledge Curator, trusted but watched. When people pass, they exchange precise gestures—fingers splayed at exact angles, wrists rotating in measured arcs. These aren't mere greetings but complex communications of relative standing, current alliances, and ancestral obligations.

I navigate this intricate social choreography effortlessly, my body knowing the movements before my mind processes them. Until today.

At the Grand Convocation, where thousands gather under the crystal dome, I approach the Circle of Elders. The Highest Elder extends her hand, palm down with three fingers curled—requesting the Gesture of Deferred Wisdom. But something inside me rebels.

Instead of the proper response, I grasp her hand firmly, look directly into her eyes (forbidden!), and loudly proclaim, "Your wisdom is built on beautiful lies!"

The collective gasp is almost tangible. Collars throughout the hall flash crimson and black. The dome's light dims as if the city itself recoils in shock.

I've committed the unforgivable—questioned authority while violating physical boundaries and eye contact protocols simultaneously. My collar turns ash-gray, marking me as socially dead. People back away, creating a perfect circle of isolation around me that feels simultaneously metaphorical and terrifyingly real.

The dream shifts, and I feel the weight of ten thousand eyes watching me, not with anger but something worse—profound disappointment, as though I've betrayed not just rules but the very fabric of our shared reality...
