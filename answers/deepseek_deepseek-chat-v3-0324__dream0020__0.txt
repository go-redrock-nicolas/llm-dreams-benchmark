I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of old books and candle wax, though the venue is neither a library nor a chapel—it’s a grand, decaying ballroom, its gilded edges tarnished by time. The ceiling stretches into an impossible void, where chandeliers flicker like distant stars, casting long, wavering shadows that dance across the faces of those gathered.  

The moment I step inside, the murmur of voices hushes, as though the room itself has been holding its breath for my arrival. The guests are familiar, yet altered—faces I once knew softened by years or sharpened by unspoken grudges. Their eyes gleam with something between recognition and quiet accusation.  

At the far end of the room, a figure stands by a grand piano, fingers resting on the keys but not pressing down. The air thrums with the ghost of a melody that was never played. Someone I once loved—or perhaps wronged—turns to me, their smile a fragile thing, like a spiderweb after rain.  

"Did you ever mean to come back?" they ask, and the question lingers, unanswered, as the dream shifts beneath my feet. The floor tilts, and suddenly, we are standing on the surface of a vast, still lake, the reflections of the chandeliers stretching into infinity below us.  

A hand brushes mine—warm, real—but when I turn, no one is there. Only the echo of laughter, the faintest scent of perfume, and the slow, sinking realization that some doors, once closed, were never meant to be reopened.  

And then—just before waking—the piano finally plays a single, resonant note, trembling through the dream like a heartbeat.
