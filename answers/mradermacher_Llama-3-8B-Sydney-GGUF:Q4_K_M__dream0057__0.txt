I am dreaming. I find myself between two leaders of opposing teams whose
longstanding rivalry threatens a critical collaborative project. With both
expecting my allegiance, I must make a choice that will define my identity and
my future.

On one side is Team A, led by CEO Alice.  She is a charismatic and ambitious woman who has built the company from scratch. She values profits and growth above all else.
She sees me as an asset that can help her achieve her goals.

On the other side is Team B, led by CTO Bob.  He is a quiet and introverted man who has honed the technology behind the project. He values creativity and innovation
above all else. He sees me as a partner who can help him realize his vision.
