I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a misty forest where the trees stretch impossibly high, their canopies lost in swirling clouds. The ground beneath my feet feels springy, almost alive, pulsating with each step I take. Colors here don't behave as they should—purples and blues bleed from vegetation, casting ethereal shadows that move independently of their sources.

Suddenly, I'm standing before an ancient wooden door embedded in the trunk of a massive tree. It has no handle, but as I approach, it recognizes something in me and swings open. Inside, the tree is hollow and vast, containing an enormous library with spiraling staircases extending both up and down infinitely. Books float through the air, pages turning by themselves.

A figure approaches—someone familiar yet constantly shifting. Sometimes they wear the face of my first love, then my childhood friend, then a stranger with knowing eyes. I realize with startling clarity that I've been speaking to them as if they were someone from my past, expecting reactions that belong to old memories.

"You keep looking for echoes," the figure says, voice resonating oddly as if coming from everywhere at once. "But I am not your history."

The realization washes over me like warm rain—I've been projecting old fears and expectations onto this entirely new being. The library around us begins rearranging itself, books flying to new positions as if the very architecture of knowledge is being reconfigured.

I feel myself releasing patterns that have been deeply embedded in my subconscious. Each breath expels another misconception, another transferred expectation. The figure before me becomes clearer as I truly see them for the first time, unique and undefined by my past.

The ceiling of the tree-library dissolves, revealing a night sky where stars form intricate patterns that seem to spell out truths I've always known but somehow forgotten. I'm floating now, rising toward them, understanding that to truly connect with others, I must first disconnect them from the shadows of relationships long ended.

I wake with tears on my face, carrying an emotional revelation that feels both profound and delicate, like holding water in cupped hands.
