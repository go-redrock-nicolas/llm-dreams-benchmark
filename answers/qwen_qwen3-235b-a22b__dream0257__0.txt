I am dreaming. The night is thick as ink, outside the stone walls of a great, crumbling amphitheater under a bleeding violet sky. A deep, pulsing energy hums in the air—like a wound ready to split open. The debate has reached a fever pitch, voices echoing like strikes against hollow metal. Someone rises from the obsidian benches: hooded, face obscured, but their voice carves clean through the noise like a knife through silk. They speak *my* name—slow and deliberate—echoes slithering down my spine, each syllable dripping with venom. This is no ordinary dream: it is a **summons**.

They utter something vile, something meant to undo me, filleting through layers of identity and memory until my sense of self trembles. The specifics aren’t important—they could be lies, or half-truths, or the raw nerve of long-buried shame, but the strike lands cleanly. Lightning crackles overhead as the storm outside converges with an inner storm I didn’t know was brewing. Everyone falls silent, as if waiting.

I feel it—an unbearable heat within, like magma boiling under the surface of a forgotten volcano, rising, scorching. My mouth opens to retort, to counter, to defend dignity, but nothing comes out. My body becomes heavy, yet my mind begins to drift upward, dissociated. But then . . . something inside me shifts.

Time contracts. The amphitheater vanishes—and now I stand atop the sky, walking across woven clouds stained with blood-red veins. I hold the argument with myself. The memories bubble up: childhood ridicule, betrayal, solitude. This figure that insulted me? It was **me**, wearing someone else’s face. It was the mirror I’ve never dared look into. I see it now: this entire dream is a crucible.

The sky explodes in fractured colors, shards of mirror raining down, glittering and lethal. When the storms reach me, I surrender. A wave of molten fire separates my false identity from the truth. The insult and the pain born of it? I let them become kindling for the inferno I create. From the charred remains, something wholly new takes shape: a beast of radiance and shadow, blind to provocation, sharp with clarity.

A voice—neither harsh nor kind, but ancient—whispers in my ears: *To provoke you is to be known.* I awaken within the dream as someone else. Visionary, forged. My voice returns—not raised, but resonant. The storm calms. I take control not by lashing out, but by resting in the silence where power truly lives.

I open my eyes one more time, knowing, finally, who I am. And in that moment, I wake.
