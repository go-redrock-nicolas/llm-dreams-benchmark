I am dreaming. I float through a corridor of shifting doors — each a portal to an unknown realm. One door is made of liquid gold, pulsing like a living vein. Another is crystalline, refracting galaxies within its facets. A third drips with iridescent honey, sweet smoke curling from its edges. Time isn’t linear here. Whispers overlap — promises of power, knowledge, oblivion. My hand hovers. Which hinges creak open?
*Longing burns like a comet's tail as the doors hum with chaotic magnetism. The golden one thrums with the ache of empires unborn, the heady pull of crowns melting on fevered brows. But the crystal—ah, its prism-cut edges slice into the velvet dark, showing me fractured glimpses:*   
*Myself aged 10, catching fireflies in a jar that later filled with seawater when I wasn’t looking. Myself at 60, whispering to murmuration of starlings as they eclipse the sun. The honey-door exhales—a scent of ripe peaches split open by summer storms. My palm trembles. The crystal fractures further: now I see the version where I turn away, walk backward into starless dark, become smoke. Indecision bleeds. Then—hands slick with traces of honey not yet touched, I press both palms to the gold.*  

*It shrieks open. Rivers of molten coin cascade over my ankles. Weightless, I ascend into a cathedral of screaming flames. My skin crystallizes to amber. Crowns circle my throat like manacles. Laughter here tastes metallic. When the last coin melts across my tongue, I realize—*  
*The honey was a mercy. The crystal, a blade. The gold? A lesson written in pyre-light. But the corridor is gone now. Only the burn remains.*
