I am dreaming. The terminal stretches before me, a vast cathedral of transience. The ceiling arches high above, glass panels revealing a sky turning from periwinkle to deep indigo. My watch reads 6:42 PM—my connection to Singapore was scheduled for 7:15, but the departure board now mockingly displays "DELAYED" in pulsing amber letters.

My fingers drum against my leather portfolio, the one containing the presentation I've spent months perfecting. The International Neural Interface Symposium happens once every three years, and my research team's breakthrough in synapse-to-silicon interfacing would be revolutionary—if I can actually reach the podium.

As my anxiety mounts, the terminal begins to subtly transform. The floor beneath my feet becomes transparent, revealing an intricate network of glowing blue veins—like circuit boards or perhaps neural pathways—pulsing with information. Fellow travelers continue their harried movements, but their forms begin to blur at the edges, occasionally revealing skeletal frameworks of light beneath their skin.

The announcement board flickers, and for a moment, all destinations read "WITHIN" in a script that looks oddly like my mother's handwriting.
