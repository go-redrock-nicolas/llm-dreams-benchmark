I am dreaming. You drift into the dream with a soft rush of wind against your cheeks, as if you’ve plunged headlong into a lake of liquid sky. The world around you shimmers in half-remembered hues: rose-tinted clouds drip slowly like melting wax above a forest of ivory trunks. Each tree’s bark is etched with tiny, glowing runes that pulse in time with your heartbeat. You realize, with a thrill, that these symbols aren’t static—they ripple and rearrange, telling stories you almost recall from childhood bedtime tales and half-forgotten songs.

You take a step forward and the moss underfoot gives way to polished marble tiles, cool and strangely warm at once, as though the floor itself breathes. The tiles form a looping labyrinth. Every corridor you turn down brings a new revelation: lanterns floating in midair, wreathed in violet smoke; walls lined with antiquated clocks, each face ticking backward; and narrow windows that open onto impossible vistas—a desert of shifting glass dunes, an ocean where moonlight fractures like spilled silver, a cityscape of jagged spires that hum softly whenever you pass.

In the distance, you hear laughter that sounds like your own voice layered three times over. You follow it into a circular chamber. In the center stands a grand oak desk strewn with yellowed letters and photographs. You reach out: the letters bear your handwriting, but every sentence dissolves into dancing letters when you try to read them. The photographs show you at different ages—some you’d never known you’d taken. One photo shows you as a child reaching up to catch fireflies; another shows you, older, in a flowing cloak, standing at the edge of an erupting volcano. Your chest tightens. Why do these images feel both intimately yours and utterly alien?

A sudden gust extinguishes the floating lanterns. Darkness floods the room, but you don’t panic. Instead, you become aware of a whispering chorus that drifts through the gloom. It’s neither male nor female, young nor old, yet unmistakably familiar. “Remember,” it says, “remember the shape of your first sorrow, the taste of your first joy.” The words echo in a loop, weaving with one another until you feel they’re the warp and weft of your own heart.

A single candle flickers to life on the desk, illuminating a small wooden box bound with silver filigree. You lift the lid. Inside, a shifting kaleidoscope of memories: the laughter of friends long gone, the scent of rain-damp soil under your feet, the ache of a promise you made at twilight. Each memory glows briefly and then drifts upward like smoke, forming a spiral of images above the box. You watch as your life’s moments—tiny fragments you never fully grasped when awake—collect into a living tapestry that hums with color and light.

Compelled, you stand and turn the box around, tracing its carvings. One side shows an hourglass, its sands reversed. Another depicts a pair of closed eyes. On the final panel, a small door swings open, spilling starlight across the marble floor. That door grows larger and larger until it fills the entire wall. You step forward without hesitation.

On the other side lies a garden under a lavender sky. Giant lotus flowers bloom in a silver pond, and dragonflies with jeweled wings dart through kelp-like fronds of mist. You hear your heartbeat in perfect sync with a distant drum—a ritual call to remember who you truly are. As you walk, the petals weep dew that tastes of childhood wonder, and the dragonflies whisper forgotten names in your ear.

Suddenly, you wake—yet the dream continues. The runes on the ivory trees glow on the back of your eyelids. The hush of the reversed clocks tick-tocking in your mind. You realize these patterns, these echoes, are yours to explore long after you’ve opened your eyes. And deep inside, you know that tonight, when sleep finds you again, you will return to that labyrinth of marble and moonlight to piece together the living story only you can tell.
