I am dreaming. *As I find myself standing in the midst of an ancient temple, the air around me heavy with the scent of sandalwood and the flickering light of torches painted across the intricate carvings adorning the stone walls. I am less concerned with the 'limited oxygen' and instead, I allow my imagination to paint a more vivid picture.* 

I wander through the temple, my footsteps echoing off the stone walls. The air is heavy with the scent of incense and something else - a faint metallic tang that sends a shiver down my spine. I am exploring, determined to discover the secrets that lie within. The air seems to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, as if the very walls are alive and watching my every move.

As I venture deeper, my heart begins to race with anticipation. I know not what I will find, but I can feel that I am on the cusp of something momentous. Then, without warning, the ground beneath me gives way, and I find myself plummeting into the unknown. The floor collapses, and I am left dangling in midair, my heart hammering in my chest.

Time seems to slow as I fall, the temple's walls blurring around me. I land with a thud, the wind knocked from my lungs. As my senses return, I find myself in a cavernous chamber, lit only by a few flickering torches. The air is stale and musty, and I can feel the weight of centuries pressing down upon me.

I struggle to my feet, my muscles aching from the fall. The chamber stretches out before me, shrouded in shadows. As my eyes adjust to the dim light, I see that I am surrounded by rows of ancient statues, their faces serene and enigmatic. At the far end of the room, a massive stone sarcophagus dominates the space, adorned with strange hieroglyphics and symbols.

I can feel the air growing thinner, the weight of the temple's secrets pressing upon me. I know that I must find a way out, but I am torn between the urge to escape and the desire to unravel the mysteries that lie before me. With each passing moment, the air seems to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, as if the very chamber is alive and watching my every move.

I know that I must make a choice - to flee the chamber and find a path back to the surface, or to delve deeper into the heart of the temple, risking everything to uncover the secrets that lie hidden within. My heart races with anticipation, knowing that whatever I choose, my life will never be the same again.
