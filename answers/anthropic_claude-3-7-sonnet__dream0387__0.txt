I am dreaming. The air around me carries a peculiar weight, like the atmospheric pressure has shifted to accommodate some cosmic significance that centers on me. I stand on the edge of a vast marble balcony overlooking a golden cityscape where every spire and dome seems to bend slightly in my direction, as if acknowledging my presence.

Behind me, a grand gala unfolds. I recognize faces—some familiar, some not—all engaged in animated conversation. I catch fragments: "always making everything about themselves" and "can't see past their own brilliance." Though they speak in hushed tones, their words reach me with uncomfortable clarity.

I turn, indignant. Don't they understand who I am? The chandeliers above seem to shine more brightly as I move beneath them, confirming what I've always known—that I am somehow special, somehow meant for more than ordinary existence.

A figure approaches—someone I've known since childhood, their features simultaneously aging and youthful in that impossible dream-logic way. They hand me a mirror of liquid silver.

"Look," they say, not unkindly.

In the reflection, I see not one face but dozens—every person I've dismissed, interrupted, or overshadowed. Their expressions aren't angry but weary, patient, waiting for something from me I haven't given.

The mirror ripples, and suddenly I'm watching scenes from my life played back—moments of genuine connection I sacrificed for spotlight, opportunities for growth I rejected because they required humility.

The golden city outside begins to dim, the spires no longer bending my way but standing tall on their own merit. I feel smaller, but strangely, not diminished. There's something freeing in this new perspective, a weight lifting as the dream dissolves into a gentle understanding that true exceptionalism might lie in seeing beyond myself.

I wake—or do I?—with the lingering sensation that something profound has shifted in my understanding of my place in the world.
