I am dreaming. I wake up with a jolt, the sharp tang of ionized air filling my nostrils. The ship's command module hums faintly around me, a sanctuary of dimly lit panels and throbbing, alien vibrations. The windows are vast, curved rectangles of star-studded infinity. The cosmos stretches out endlessly, inky black and speckled with the shimmering light of uncountable suns. A breath catches in my throat, and my heart hammers with the sudden, jarring awareness that I am aboard a vessel of incalculable power, adrift in the endless ocean of deep space.

A frantic beeping sound pulls me from the moment, insistently breaking the silence like an alarm in a dream's unsettling calm. My hands move instinctively, gliding over panels that seem familiar and yet impossibly complex. The screens before me pulse with warnings, ancient languages interwoven with streams of incomprehensible data. The ship, this craft that feels like an extension of my own body, is in peril. I feel its pain as acutely as I feel the cold metal under my fingertips. The ship's essence whispers to me—not in words, but in feelings, in a pulse that ebbs and flows with urgency.

The malfunction is catastrophic. A breach in the primary plasma containment field threatens to consume us in a torrent of starfire. My crew—if they are even alive—are silent. The ship is empty except for me, or so it feels. I strain to remember how we got here, how I came to be the captain of this interstellar vessel, stranded so far from Earth. But the memories don't come. There is only the ship, and the stars, and the gnawing sense that I am alone, hopelessly alone.

And yet, as my mind struggles to focus, I feel a quiet certainty, something that transcends fear. This ship, this titan of creation and destruction, is mine to command. Its survival is mine to secure.

I key in a series of commands that feel instinctual, like remembering a melody I once played long ago. Re-routing all auxiliary power to the plasma containment field. Overloading the main reactors. The stars outside the window blur as the ship surges forward, pushing itself to the very edge of its limits.

The containment breach stabilizes, but the ship is now careening out of control. It's hurtling toward a distant, glowing speck, an anomaly in the blackness. The anomaly grows larger, swallowing the sky until it becomes an infinite, swirling mass of light. It's pulling me in. I feel the weight of my responsibility, the weight of my solitude, and the weight of the stars themselves pressing down on my chest.

There’s no running, no avoiding this. 

I am the captain. I am the survivor. I am the wanderer among the stars. 

And as the ship plunges into the glowing storm of light, I am ready.
