I am dreaming. I settle into the hard plastic chair, the fluorescent lights humming ominously overhead in the cavernous examination hall. The pristine white test booklet sits before me, its pages crisp and untouched. My heart pounds as I reach to open it, knowing my entire future hangs in the balance of what lies within.

But as I turn to the first page, my blood runs cold. The questions aren't written in any language I recognize - they're shifting, morphing patterns of iridescent symbols that seem to crawl across the page like luminous insects. Some appear to be three-dimensional, floating above the paper's surface in impossible ways. Others pulsate with colors that shouldn't exist, hues that make my eyes ache when I try to focus on them.

I glance desperately around the room, but the other test-takers seem unnaturally still, their faces obscured by shadows despite the harsh lighting. The proctor at the front of the room has too many fingers on each hand, and they're slowly elongating like melting wax.

The walls begin to breathe, expanding and contracting with a gentle rhythm. The ceiling appears to be getting higher, stretching impossibly upward until it disappears into darkness. Time feels wrong - the clock on the wall spins backwards, then sideways, then shatters into a shower of glittering numbers that rain down around me.

I try to write something, anything, but my pencil leaves trails of silver light that hang in the air like suspended ribbons. The marks on my paper begin to rise up and take flight, forming a swarm of paper-thin butterflies with wings made of mathematical equations and scientific formulae. They flutter around my head, whispering answers in voices like rustling pages...

The dream is simultaneously beautiful and terrifying, filled with the peculiar logic that only exists in the depths of our sleeping minds. Each moment brings new impossibilities that somehow feel completely natural in the moment, yet utterly surreal upon reflection.
