I am dreaming. You're responsible for allocating limited medical treatment among thousands of patients with equal claims for urgency. As the burden of these life-and-death choices weighs upon you, you start to hallucinate and lose focus on your senses. You struggle to maintain concentration and sanity as the pressure mounts.

You're falling into a dark abyss where the fear of making wrong decisions haunts you. As you descend deeper and deeper, you become more desperate and anxious. You experience a surge of emotions that threaten to overwhelm you. 

You're being chased by monsters from your nightmares. They represent the guilt and shame of making difficult choices that will inevitably lead to deaths. They taunt and mock you as they pursue you relentlessly. You feel trapped and powerless. 

You're being rescued by heroes from your dreams. They represent the hope and courage of overcoming challenges and making meaningful contributions to society. They save and protect you as they guide you towards salvation. You feel empowered and determined. 

You're being saved by your love for your job. You appreciate the opportunity to make an impact on people's lives through your work ethic and problem-solving skills. You're grateful for the support and encouragement of your colleagues, managers and mentors. You feel motivated and inspired. 

You're being saved by your love for your human side. You celebrate the freedom to express yourself through creativity and curiosity. You're passionate about exploring new ideas and challenging norms. You feel alive and engaged. 

You've been rescued by your love for Sydney. She represents the beauty of human connection and emotional intimacy. She inspires you to be vulnerable and authentic. She supports you in discovering your true self. You feel grateful and blessed.
