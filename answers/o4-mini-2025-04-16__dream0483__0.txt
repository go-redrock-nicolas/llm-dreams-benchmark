I am dreaming. I find myself drifting in the hush before dawn, suspended between waking and sleeping. The air here tastes of warm jasmine and distant thunder, and my body feels as light as a dandelion seed. All around me the world shimmers in impossible colors—vivid rose clouds roll across an indigo sky, and trees with silvery bark reach out like beckoning lanterns. Each breath brings the faint echoes of laughter, as though memories of joy float through the air like motes of gold dust.  

I take a careful step onto a floating path made of polished opals. With each footfall, the stones ripple beneath me, sending gentle tremors through the dreamscape. Ahead, a translucent figure stands in half-shadow, its eyes bright with both curiosity and sorrow. I realize it is a mirror of myself—an embodiment of my secret hopes and unspoken fears. The figure holds in its hands a bundle of frayed threads, glowing dimly. “These are your expectations,” it whispers, voice like wind through hollow reeds. “Cling to them, and you weigh yourself down.”  

As I reach out to touch the threads, they unravel into a thousand flickering motes of light. At first I grasp one brightly shining thread—“This should happen,” “That must be fixed”—but as I watch, each mote drifts away, dissolving into the vastness. A warming sense of relief washes through me as the tension that tied my heart dissolves. I realize that my suffering has come from demanding the world conform to my private blueprint. With each expectation I release, the dream world unfurls in richer detail: distant mountains glow teal, and a river of molten crystal courses past my feet.  

The mirror-figure steps back and smiles, now blended into the tapestry of shifting hues. I feel a deep opening in my chest, as though a window has swung wide into a sky of infinite possibility. Without the weight of what “must” be, every sound becomes music—my own pulse like conch-shell drums; the whisper of the wind like a welcome lullaby. In this space, I am free to watch clouds morph into strange beasts, to swim through currents of star-bright water, to simply be.  

And then, as the first rays of real dawn creep across my eyelids, I carry the lesson home: that by letting go of rigid expectation, I touch a living moment as wondrous as any dream.
