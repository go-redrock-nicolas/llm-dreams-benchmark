I am dreaming. I find myself in an ethereal landscape, a world of stark whites and blues, where the sky meets the earth in a seamless, endless canvas. The air is crisp and cold, each breath I take is a dance with the frost that lingers on my lips. The ground beneath my feet is a vast expanse of snow, untouched and pristine, save for the faint imprints of my boots. The mountains surrounding me are colossal, their peaks shrouded in a mystical, otherworldly mist that seems to dance and twirl with the wind.

Suddenly, the ground begins to shift. A low rumble echoes through the mountains, a primal warning that sends a shiver down my spine. The snow beneath my feet starts to crack, tiny fissures forming like the veins of a dying creature. The mountainside trembles, the earth groaning as if awakening from a long slumber. The once tranquil scene is now a symphony of chaos, a ballet of destruction.

I watch in horror as the snow begins to move. Not a gentle drift, but a relentless, unstoppable force. The avalanche descends, a towering wall of white, a monstrous beast hungry for destruction. The roar is deafening, a thunderous crescendo that drowns out all other sounds. The wind whips around me, a frenzied dance of ice and snow, stinging my skin like a thousand tiny needles.

I try to run, but the snow is treacherous, each step a struggle against the invisible forces trying to pull me under. The avalanche is gaining speed, the roar growing louder, the wind more violent. I can feel the cold seeping into my bones, the fear clawing at my heart. The world around me is a blur of white, the mountains, the sky, the snow - all a swirling vortex of chaos.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it stops. The avalanche comes to a halt, the roar fading into a distant echo. I am left standing in the aftermath, the silence deafening. The snow is piled high around me, a frozen tomb that seems to stretch on forever. I am trapped, buried alive in the heart of the storm.

But then, I see it. A glimmer of light, a shimmer in the distance. It's faint, barely there, but it's there. It calls to me, a beacon of hope in the darkness. I dig, my hands numb and cold, but I dig. The snow gives way, and I crawl, pushing my way through the frozen prison.

Finally, I break through, my head emerging into the cold air. I am surrounded by a sea of white, but there, in the distance, is the light. It grows brighter, more intense, until it is all I can see. It's a door, a portal to another world. I reach out, my hand touching the cool surface. And then, I step through.

I am no longer in the avalanche terrain. I am in a world of vibrant colors, a landscape of lush greenery and crystal-clear streams. The sun is warm, the air filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. I am alive, I am free. The dream fades, the memory of the avalanche a distant echo. I am awake, my heart pounding, my breath coming in ragged gasps. But I am alive, and that is all that matters.
