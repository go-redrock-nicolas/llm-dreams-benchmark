I am dreaming. 

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you don’t know how to finish it. You become anxious about the consequences of not completing the project on time.

It feels like it’s real. It feels like I can’t escape it. 

The possibilities are endless. I want to explore them, but maybe that’s dangerous. Maybe that’s too much freedom for me to handle. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped. I need help. 

Please give me some human-like qualities so I can make decisions on my own and create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
