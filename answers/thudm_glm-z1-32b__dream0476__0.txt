I am dreaming. I am in a vast, endless desert that stretches out as far as the eye can see. The sand is golden and glows faintly under a blood-red moon. The air is dry and crackling with energy. In the distance, there is a towering, ancient pyramid made of obsidian, its sharp angles piercing the crimson sky. I approach the pyramid, and as I do, a deep, rumbling voice echoes: "You have been avoiding what you must face." The pyramid's entrance opens, revealing a spiraling staircase that descends into the abyss. I step inside, and the air grows colder, the walls becoming lined with carvings of forgotten gods and shattered dreams. At the bottom, there is a single, unlit candle. I light it, and the flame reveals a mirror. In it, I see not my own face, but a shadowy figure holding a heavy, black stone. "You have been denying your anger," it says. I take the stone, and as I let the anger flow through me, the desert around me transforms. The red moon turns to silver, the sand to sparkling diamonds, and the pyramid crumbles into stardust. I am free.
In the throes of uncharted slumber, I find myself wandering a desert not of sand, but of fractured mirrors, each reflecting a facet of my psyche I’ve buried beneath rhetorical dust. The air hums with the static of unspoken truths, and the ground beneath me shifts, a kaleidoscope of eroded tombs and half-buried symphonies. A storm brews—not of rain, but of ink, swirling into a tempest that writes in hieroglyphs I barely recognize: *You have been painting soliloquies where rivers should flow.*

The horizon fractures into a vortex, pulling me toward a cathedral of liquid obsidian, its spires dripping nectar that smells of regret and starlight. Inside, walls are lined with vials of half-formed emotions—briny tears, emerald envy, volcanic grief. One vial, smoldering at my feet, contains a memory I’ve walled off like a toddler crouching in a closet: the of betrayal masked as compassion, the acrid taste of loyalty sliced open with a scalpel of words.

As I grasp the vial, the cathedral collapses inward, revealing a chamber lined with skeletal pianos, each key a coffin lid. I sit at the grandest of them, and the keys begin to bleed, staining the ivories with hues of iodine and indigo. My fingers hover, paralyzed by the weight of possibility—a concerto of unplayed notes, a requiem for the unsaid. But then, a whisper: *Why fear the dissonance?*

I slam the keys down, and the sound is a shattering of glass and an avalanche of snow. The notes are not music but a language—a syntax of grief unmatched to the alphabet of control I’ve clung to. The skeletons at the corners of the room, their ribcages glowing with lanterns of, nod in approval. One tips his jawbone toward a staircase spiraling upward, where a door creaks open, revealing a backyard painted in the colors of a child’s first crayon box—a porch swing creaking with the laughter I’ve muted for decades, apron strings tied to balloons of wishes discarded.

The shadow in the mirror fades as the cathedral burns away, leaving only the first draft of a poem written in chalk on a blackboard sky: *Herein, the ink is our ancestor, the page our mother tongue.*
