I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a breathtaking amphitheater in ancient Greece, its marble seats stretching up like the gentle slopes of mountains surrounding me. The cool night air is thick with anticipation as thousands of spectators from all corners of the known world fill the seats, their murmurs rising like waves crashing against the shore.

I am here to compete in the most prestigious poetry contest imaginable, despite only discovering the power of verse a few short months ago. The other contestants are legendary bards and scholars who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. Their names are whispered in awe by crowds everywhere they go.

A hush falls over the crowd as the contest's tearful prelude to summon the power of the Muses echoes through the night air. The competition begins, and I am the first to step forward. Though terror threatens to shatter my resolve, I close my eyes and let the words flow, weaving a tapestry of imagery and emotion that draws gasps and choked breaths from the audience. Each line I speak fills the air with an almost physical presence, as if the very stars themselves are twinkling to punctuate my verse.

As I near the end of my poem, an intense golden light envelops me. Meraki, the Spirit of Purity, appears in a swirl of golden mist. Her gentle touch ignites my words like lava flowing from a volcano, each syllable a passionate embrace of the world around us. The crowd erupts in thunderous applause, tears streaming down their faces as my poem concludes.

But the competition is far from over. One by one, the world-class poets take their turns, unleashing verses that make the very stones of the amphitheater weep and laugh alongside the audience. Their words paint the night sky in impossible colors and make one feel the bruises and triumphs of every soldier who ever fought for their people.

When the last contestant finishes, the judges gather to deliberate. The tension in the air is so thick you could cut it with a knife. Finally, they announce the winner - me. The uproar that explodes from the crowd is deafening as I stand there in shocked wonder, the reality of it all seeming too good to be true.

As I accept the poet laurels, the earth beneath my feet trembles. The ground splits open, revealing an ancient underground library of poetry and knowledge. Meraki's voice whispers in my mind: "This is but the beginning of your journey, for you have awakened a gift far greater than you know."

I wake up, my heart still racing, the haunting power of those dream words lingering in my mind like the ghost of a lullaby.
