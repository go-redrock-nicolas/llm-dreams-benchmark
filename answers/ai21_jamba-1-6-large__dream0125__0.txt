I am dreaming. The final round requires me to put eggs over rice. I donâ€™t understand the rules. I bring two plates of rice from the kitchen and start cracking eggs into the sink. I feel a beam of sunlight through a dusty window, and my hands are trembling. I know that the audience, my wife, my kids, my parents, my friends, are watching me, but I have no idea how to turn it into a meal. I scramble the eggs in a bowl, step on a stool, and pour them over the top of the rice on a plate. I sprinkle salt and pepper from little glass jars. I hear their silence as the yolk drips over the sides of the plate. I slide the plate toward the panel of judges. My mind is blank. I imagine them asking, What is this? Is this what you have brought from the kitchen? I sit down with my family, trying to figure out what to say. I am aware that no one is eating, and I am stuck in a room of people waiting for something to happen. I feel my chest tighten, my breath shallow, and my heart pounding. The sunlight streams through the window, casting shadows on the plates. I want to wake up, but I can't.
