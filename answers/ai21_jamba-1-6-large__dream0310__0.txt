I am dreaming. I'm participating in a religious ceremony from a tradition not my own. As I engage with these unfamiliar spiritual practices, I feel the warmth of a sacred fire burning low, its embers glowing faintly. Shadows from the flames dance chimerically across walls adorned with ancient symbols I cannot comprehend. I hear the rhythmic chant of a cantor, their voice rising and tying into notes that migrate through the heavy veil of incense. The words speak to the other side of the universe, a sound that lingers in my bones.

I join the chant, not knowing its meaning or essence, but the resonance of my voice in harmony with the others feels right. My heart picks up its own rhythm, and my mind, usually so vigilant, drifts into a state of peace. Though I donâ€™t understand the words I speak, the prayer connects me to something far larger than myself, as if the sound itself is the bridge. The ceremony wraps me in its mystery, and in my dream, I feel as though I am partaking in the essence of creation itself, untethered by time or the limitations of mortal thought.
