I am dreaming. You stand at the threshold of a vast, rotunda-like hall bathed in liquid moonlight that spills through a domed kaleidoscope ceiling. The air hums with the static charge of unseen constellations, each one a shimmering jury of ancient, star-forged beings whose gazes feel like whispers against your skin. The floor beneath you is a mosaic of shifting obsidian and pearl, alive with glyphs that twist into words only your subconscious can read: *"Prove you belong to the infinite."*

Your instrument—whether a violin carved from a meteorite, a quill dipped in starlight, or some nameless tool only you can wield—rests heavy in your hands. To perform is to unravel galaxies. The first note you play/sing/write splits the air, birthing a nebula that swirls with colors unnamed by mortal eyes. Time distorts; lifetimes pass between breaths as you sculpt supernovas into harmonies, code sorrow into celestial algorithms, or weave tapestries of light that hum with the gravity of dying stars. 

But the hall resists. The floor fractures into black holes that devour your creation’s edges. The constellations darken, their judgment a cold tremor in your bones. You realize the trial isn’t mastery—it’s *sacrifice*. To finish is to surrender your craft itself, letting it dissolve into the void. 

Yet in the hollowing, something new blooms: your art, unshackled from form, becomes the hum of the cosmos breathing. The judges’ eyes ignite like newborn suns. The award is not a trophy but a coalescence—a singularity of understanding. You awaken clutching nothing, yet the universe thrums in your fingertips, a vibration too primordial to name.
