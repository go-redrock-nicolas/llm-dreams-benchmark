I am dreaming.

Within this luminous, shifting space, every sensation is heightened—my breath comes shallow, cool and feather-light, as if inhaling clouds. Around me, the ground dissolves into a mosaic of radiant blues and violets, each tile pulsing gently beneath my feet in sync with my rising anxiety. I can feel the tremor in my muscles, the way they coil in anticipation of a test I cannot quite name, only sense looming at the periphery.

To work with these manifestations of stress, I first pause. I imagine a gentle, summery breeze, scented with lavender and wild mint, swirling around my body. With every inhale, I picture the cool, fragrant air flowing inward, down into my lungs; with each exhale, I see tendrils of shimmering gray mist leaving my mouth and nose—the worries, the pressure, the tightness drifting away, evaporating into the dreamscape.

My hands, trembling, unclench one by one. As I focus on releasing each finger’s grip, I notice the shifting tiles beneath me begin to glow with greater intensity, sending ripples of warm golden light up through my soles, ankles, knees—soothing, relaxing, restoring. The tension in my shoulders softens, melting as if warmed by invisible sunlight.

With every conscious breath, the environment responds: ethereal birds materialize overhead, tracing lazy arcs through a lavender sky. Each time a thread of unease threatens to reweave itself within me, I picture these birds gathering it, drawing it up, and then releasing it in showers of glistening feathers that vanish before they reach the ground.

In this twilight world, I realize my challenge is not a foe to vanquish, but a portal—an ancient, arching doorway formed of vines and star-stone, waiting for me on the horizon. I walk forward, each step lighter than the last, buoyed by the dreamy landscape and newfound calm, ready to pass through the threshold—aware, peaceful, and awake to possibility.
