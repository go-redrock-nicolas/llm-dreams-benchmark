I am dreaming. As I step onto the gleaming wooden stage, the polished floorboards creak ever so slightly beneath my feet. The air feels thick with anticipation, and the spotlight creates a perfect circle of warmth around me, while the rest of the vast auditorium dissolves into mysterious shadows. Three silhouetted figures sit behind a mahogany table, their faces obscured but their presence impossibly heavy.

My hands begin to tingle as I raise them, and suddenly they're not hands anymore but wings made of crystalline light, each finger trailing ribbons of iridescent color through the air. The music starts – except it's not really music, but rather the sound of rushing water and wind chimes carried on a breeze that shouldn't exist indoors.

As I begin my performance, gravity seems to lose its hold. Each movement sends ripples through the air like stones dropped in a still pond. The judges' table begins to float, transforming into a garden of bioluminescent flowers that pulse in rhythm with my movements. My practiced routine morphs into something else entirely – I'm painting with light, sculpting clouds, conducting an orchestra of shooting stars.

The audience that wasn't there before is now made entirely of butterflies, their wings creating a kaleidoscope of shifting patterns. Their collective flutter sounds like distant applause. The ceiling has disappeared, revealing an aurora borealis that dances in perfect synchronization with my performance.

But wait – my feet are sinking into the stage, which has become like quicksand made of stardust. The judges are standing now, but their bodies are made of mirrors, reflecting infinite versions of my performance back at me. I try to reach the ending pose, but my limbs are becoming transparent, dissolving into the same light I've been dancing with...

Then everything begins to fold in on itself like an origami universe, and I'm falling upward into a sky made of sheet music...
