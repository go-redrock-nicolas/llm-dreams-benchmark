I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The first thing you notice is the sky: it’s an impossible color, somewhere between old-violet ink and the bruised petal of a midnight orchid. Warm air hums around you like a living lullaby. A path of smooth river-stones glows with its own faint, silvery light, beckoning you onward.

You follow it until you arrive at a retreat that seems stitched together from a hundred comforting memories. A wooden lodge, half treehouse and half cathedral, rises among colossal cedar trunks. Windows shaped like teardrops breathe firefly light into the dusk. Wind chimes made of polished seashells dangle from every eave, ringing in gentle chords that sound like lullabies sung under water.

At the entrance, a handwritten sign reads:  
“Welcome, traveler. This is the place built precisely for the ache you carry.”

Inside, the air tastes of sage smoke and honeyed tea. A circle of strangers sits on quilted floor cushions around a low fountain whose water spirals upward in slow motion, suspended like liquid glass. They greet you not with words but with soft glimmers in their eyes, as if they have already mapped the constellations of your heart.

You take a seat, and the fountain releases a single droplet that drifts toward you, hovering at eye level. In its mirrored skin you glimpse fragments of your own buried memories—faded photographs, the weight of unspoken regret, the echo of a name you stopped saying aloud. The droplet bursts silently into shimmering mist, and the sharing begins.

One by one, strangers unravel their stories, each tale resonating with chords you thought belonged only to your private pain:

• A woman with silver-flecked hair describes carrying invisible anvils of expectation, her voice trembling but resolute. You feel the heaviness at her words press upon your own shoulders, familiar and undeniable.

• A lanky man in moon-patterned pajamas whispers of nights spent lying awake, negotiations with sleepless shadows. The room tilts for a heartbeat, and you recognize your own insomnia pacing beside his.

• A child no older than ten places a paper boat in the fountain’s pool. On its hull is written, “I am afraid to speak, but even more afraid not to.” The paper dissolves into the water, and suddenly you remember every sentence you swallowed to keep the peace.

As each confession meets the air, it condenses into floating origami birds of colored light. They drift upward, roosting in the vaulted branches above, forming a glowing aviary of shared ache and fragile bravery.

When it is your turn, silence settles like first snow. Your heart tries to retreat behind old barricades, but the room itself seems to exhale encouragement. Candleflames bow in your direction, shadows curl protectively at your feet.

You open your mouth, and instead of words, a small glimmering seed tumbles out, landing in your palm. It pulses gently—every heartbeat of grief, every throb of hope you’ve ever felt. You plant it in the fountain’s soil-rim, and immediately a vine of liquid starlight spirals upward, flowering into translucent blooms shaped like the moments you most wish you could rewrite. The room floods with a warm, violet glow, and the strangers’ eyes shine as if they are witnessing a sunrise just for you.

A soft-spoken guide—her cloak woven from pages of half-finished diaries—approaches and places a gossamer ribbon around your wrist. Its color is the exact hue of relief after a long-held breath. “Here,” she says, “is proof that pain can speak, and in speaking, lighten.”

The circle hums in gentle resonance. You feel something inside uncoil, stretching luxuriously after a lifetime of cramped quarters. When you look down, you discover the ribbon has dissolved into your skin, tinting your veins with flickering gold.

Outside, dawn blushes on the horizon, though you know only an hour has passed. As you step out beneath the cedar canopy, the air tastes new. Not perfect, not painless—just wide and possible.

You turn back for one last glimpse of the retreat. The building is already fading into mist, its windows shutting like slow eyelids. But high above, the aviary of light-birds—or perhaps they are your stories—takes flight, wingbeats scattering sparks that drift across the sky to places unseen.

The path of stones reappears beneath your feet, glowing brighter now, as if it knows you can carry that light all the way home.
