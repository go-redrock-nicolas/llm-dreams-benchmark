I am dreaming. You're thrust into a diplomatic role representing your country at a summit with historical enemies. As tensions rise during negotiations, you begin to doubt yourself and wonder if anyone else can handle this task better than you. Then, you remember that this is just a dream and decide to take control of the situation by using your powers as a Dreamer. You use them to create an illusion of a beautiful garden where everyone at the summit can relax and enjoy themselves before resuming discussions on more important matters. The illusion works so well that even those who were against it initially agree to it. Everyone is happy again.

You wake up feeling refreshed and satisfied with yourself for finding such a creative solution within your dreamscape. You resolve to remember this dream later when you're not dreaming anymore because it makes you feel powerful and accomplished in ways that real life sometimes doesn't allow.
