I am dreaming. The world around me is a symphony of blinding white and piercing, frigid air that bites at any exposed patch of skin. I find myself standing precariously on a steep, snow-laden slope, the kind of pristine, untouched beauty that often masks a terrible danger. The silence is immense, almost deafening, broken only by the frantic rhythm of my own heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird. Above, the sky is a canvas of intense, crystalline blue, so vast and indifferent it makes me feel infinitesimally small.

Below, the slope plunges into an unseen abyss, a swirling vortex of mist and shadow. My feet, clad in heavy boots, feel clumsy and uncertain on the shifting surface. A palpable tension hangs in the air, a static charge that prickles the hairs on the back of my neck. The mountain itself seems to be holding its breath, waiting.

Then, it begins. A low, guttural rumble vibrates through the soles of my boots, traveling up my legs and settling deep within my chest. It's a sound that speaks of immense power, ancient and unstoppable. My eyes dart across the expanse of white, searching for the source, though my instincts already scream the terrifying truth.

Fissures, like jagged dark veins, begin to spiderweb across the snowfield beneath my feet. They spread with an unsettling speed, widening from hairline cracks to menacing crevasses in mere moments. The ground shudders violently, a tangible tremor that throws me off balance. I stumble, arms flailing wildly, desperately trying to maintain my footing on the increasingly unstable terrain.

Panic, cold and sharp, claws its way up my throat. The pristine beauty has morphed into a terrifying trap. The snow, once appearing soft and welcoming, now feels like treacherous quicksand, ready to swallow me whole. The mountain is no longer silent; it groans and shifts, releasing pent-up energy in a terrifying display.

Looking uphill, my breath catches. A wave, a colossal wave of churning snow and ice, is detaching itself from the higher ridge. It moves with horrifying grace and speed, a monstrous white tongue licking down the mountainside, consuming everything in its path. The roar intensifies, growing from a rumble to a deafening, all-encompassing surge of sound that drowns out even my own terrified shouts.

There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The fissures are widening rapidly, threatening to pull me down into the icy depths before the main avalanche even reaches me. The very ground beneath me is disintegrating, breaking apart like fragile porcelain. I scramble backwards, instinct taking over, crab-walking desperately away from the largest cracks, even as the air thickens with displaced snow and the roar of the descending torrent becomes unbearable. The mountain is shedding its skin, and I am caught, fragile and insignificant, in the midst of its violent transformation. The leading edge of the avalanche, a chaotic cloud of white powder and ice chunks, surges closer, promising obliteration. My world is tilting, fracturing, and the immense, indifferent blue sky seems impossibly far away as the white tsunami prepares to engulf me.
