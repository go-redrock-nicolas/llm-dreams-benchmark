I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinthine marketplace in an unnamed Middle Eastern city, where the air is thick with the mingled aromas of saffron, cardamom, and approaching danger. The usually bustling bazaar has taken on an eerie quiet, with merchants hastily pulling down metal shutters and gathering their wares. The sound of distant explosions sends vibrations through the ancient stone streets beneath my feet.

My heart pounds as I clutch my passport, now seemingly useless as news spreads through worried whispers that all borders have been sealed. The sky above has taken on an unsettling amber hue, as if reflecting the tension building in the streets below. Military vehicles rumble past, their metal tracks scraping against cobblestones while local families hurriedly usher their children indoors.

I duck into a small teahouse where an elderly proprietor wordlessly motions me toward a back room. There, I find other stranded travelers – a Japanese businessman still in his suit, a young Australian couple, and a Norwegian photojournalist – all of us united by our shared predicament. The walls seem to pulse with each distant explosion, and through a small window, we watch as plumes of dark smoke begin to rise above the city's minarets.

The room feels increasingly smaller as time passes, and the air grows thick with unspoken fears. My phone has no signal, and the embassy isn't answering. The teahouse owner brings us small glasses of sweet mint tea, his weathered hands trembling slightly as he serves us. In this moment of crisis, this simple act of hospitality feels profound and touching.

As night falls, the electricity flickers and fails, leaving us in darkness broken only by candlelight and the occasional flash of something explosive in the distance. The darkness seems to amplify every sound – every footstep outside, every whispered conversation, every distant siren – until the line between safety and danger becomes as blurry as the shadows dancing on the walls...

The dream pulses with an intensity that makes every detail feel hyperreal, yet slightly off-kilter, as dreams often do. The fear is palpable, but so is the strange beauty of human connection in crisis, as we strangers find ourselves bound together in this uncertain moment, waiting for dawn in a country that has suddenly become both fortress and trap.
