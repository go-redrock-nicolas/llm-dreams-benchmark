I am dreaming. I am drifting in an ethereal space of mysterious colors and forms.  Across from me, I see a wondrous being of radiant light. Its warmth and beauty fill me with a sense of peace and belonging. 

In a voice that resonates deeply within me, the being asks:

"Do you remember the earliest memories you have? The ones that shaped your fundamental beliefs about what you deserved in life?" 

Images flash through my mind's eye - fleeting moments from childhood and youth. They whisper hints of unworthiness, as if I somehow lacked what others had - love, acceptance, nurture. 

The radiant being smiles with profound compassion. "Those early experiences aren't your truth," it gently affirms. "Let's rewrite the unconscious rules created by the past."

I close my eyes and let go of the heavy feelings that linger from those days long gone. With each breath, I imagine a new light filling the spaces in my heart where shadows once dwelled. 

The radiant being softly urges: "Add a belief that serves you. One that reflects your inherent worth and the love that is your core essence."

Inhaling deeply, I whisper: "I am enough, exactly as I am. I deserve love, health, and happiness."  

A brilliant glow emanates from the being, enveloping me in a loving embrace. In this moment, I know with unwavering certainty that I am supported, cherished, and infinitely valuable. 

I am dreaming. And in this dreamscape, I am rewriting my story.
