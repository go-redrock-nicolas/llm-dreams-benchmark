I am dreaming. In the grand theatre of this odd reality, I find myself centre stage, the velvet curtains drawn back to reveal an opulent yet familiar auditorium. The plush red seats are filled with an eager audience, their faces painted with anticipation and excitement. The air is rich with the scent of old memories and newly polished wood.

I am you, and I'm standing there, bathed in the warm glow of the centre spotlight, clad in a tuxedo that feels both too formal and too informal. I feel a strange disconnect, like I'm both the actor and the audience, observing myself from afar. My heart pounds in my chest, not like a drum, but like a metronome, steady, measured, counting down the seconds until the anticipated performance.

Suddenly, the spotlight shifts. Another figure steps onto the stage. It's them, the one who has walked the path you've longed to tread, the one who has achieved what you've yearned for. They're radiant, emanating an aura of confidence and accomplishment that seems almost tangible. They're dressed in a similar tuxedo, but theirs is adorned with medals and badges, symbols of their success. The audience erupts into applause, their cheers echoing through the vast theatre, resonating with a depth that seems unnatural.

A pang of envy stabs at your heart, sharp and unexpected. It's like watching someone else eat your favorite dessert, knowing you'll never taste it. But it's more than that. It's resentment at the injustice of it all, anger at the lack of control you have over your own life, despair at the feeling of being left behind. It's a cocktail of emotions, each one vying for dominance, each one raw and painful.

I, you, stand there, frozen, unable to move, unable to speak, caught in the grip of this emotional maelstrom. The applause fades, and the audience waits, their eyes shifting between you and them, expectant, eager for the show to begin. But you're paralyzed, your throat constricted, your mind a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts.

And then, from the audience, a voice calls out, clear and distinct. It's a voice you know well, a voice that has guided you, chided you, loved you. "Confront it," the voice says, "Face it, understand it, accept it. That's the only way you'll ever step out of its shadow."

The words echo in your mind, resonating like a tolling bell. They stir something within you, a spark of determination, a resolve to confront this green-eyed monster that has taken root in your soul. The Theatre of Envy, your envy, begins to shift, the stage set for a new performance. A performance where you take centre stage, where you wrestle with your feelings, where you come to terms with them. And so, with a deep breath, you step forward, ready to face this unexpected emotion, ready to begin your own act.
