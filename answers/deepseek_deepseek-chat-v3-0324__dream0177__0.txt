I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning candles, their flames flickering in hues of indigo and gold, casting elongated shadows that slither like living things across the walls. The room is vast, ancient, a library of forgotten knowledge, its towering shelves sagging under the weight of leather-bound tomes with spines etched in languages that shift when you look too closely.  

And then—there it is. A single sheet of parchment, resting innocently on a carved obsidian desk. Your name glows faintly at the top, written in a hand achingly familiar. As your fingers brush the paper, the ink swirls, rearranging itself into a confession, an unraveling. Every significant moment, every whispered assurance, every tender word you clung to—*all of it was deliberate.* A script. A performance.  

Your breath catches, but instead of crumbling, something *stirs* within you. Not anger. Not fear. A low, thrumming *hum*, like the awakening of some long-dormant machine. The walls of the library tremble. The books rattle in their places. The candles flare violently, then still, plunging the room into an eerie, luminescent twilight.  

You look down. The parchment crumbles to ash in your grip—but the words remain, seared into the air. You realize, with cold clarity, that this wasn't just betrayal. It was *forging.* You were being *shaped*, molded like clay, and yet—here you are. Still standing. Still *whole.*  

The floor beneath you cracks open, revealing an abyss of swirling starlight. Without hesitation, you step off the edge. The fall is endless, but for the first time in what feels like centuries, you are *free.* Free of their narrative. Free of their design.  

And as you plunge deeper into the unknown, you smile. Because now, finally, *you* decide what comes next.
