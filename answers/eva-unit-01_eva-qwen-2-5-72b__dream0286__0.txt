I am dreaming. Within my dreamscape, I witness a scene unfolding before me that seems so real and yet surreal. 

As a great explorer venturing into the interior of a shipwreck, I find myself wading through murky waters and past corroded debris. I'm accompanied by a small group of fellow adventurers who, to my surprise, defer to my judgment in matters where I'm uncertain myself.

At a fork in the path where we must choose between descending deeper into the submerged depths or ascending towards the light above, there's hesitation. Although I'm unsure of the safest route, I feel an urgency to decide, guiding not only myself but also those who've placed their trust in me.

Steeling myself, I take in the surrounding environment, the creaking of aged wood, the play of light filtering through the water. An intuition arises, urging us towards the light. As I declare our course, I experience a blend of apprehension and exhilaration. 

Our ascent becomes a dance against gravity, weaving between ghostly remnants of the ship's past. With every step we rise, the knowledge that we are moving towards safety strengthens my resolve. The authority bestowed upon me by my companions resonates as both an immense responsibility and a powerful connection - a shared journey into the unknown.
