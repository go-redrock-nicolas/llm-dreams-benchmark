I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and charred wood, a heavy, suffocating perfume that clings to my skin. The sky above is a bruised purple, streaked with the last fading embers of sunset, as if the heavens themselves are mourning. Around me, the skeletal remains of my home jut from the ground like broken teeth—splintered beams, shattered glass, and the twisted metal of what was once my front gate. The wind carries whispers of the past, fragments of laughter, the echo of a door slamming shut, now swallowed by the silence of ruin.  

My feet sink slightly into the ashen soil as I take a step forward, the ground still warm beneath me, as though the earth remembers the fire that raged here. A single photograph, half-buried in the debris, catches my eye—the edges curled and blackened, the faces of loved ones fading into the smoke-stained paper. I reach for it, but the moment my fingers brush the surface, it crumbles into dust, carried away on a sudden gust.  

In the distance, the sound of water trickling draws my attention. A fractured pipe, still weeping, has formed a tiny, glistening stream that winds through the wreckage. I follow it, my reflection warping in the ripples—my face unfamiliar, hollow-eyed, a stranger in my own life. The stream leads me to the husk of an old oak tree, its trunk split down the middle, its branches bare and clawing at the sky. At its base, something glints—a small, silver key, untouched by the destruction.  

I pick it up, cold against my palm, and as I do, the wind shifts. The whispers grow louder, not just memories now, but voices—fragments of conversations I can almost grasp. A child’s laughter. My mother’s voice calling my name. The creak of the porch swing on a summer evening The key grows warm in my hand, pulsing like a heartbeat, and for a moment, the ruins around me flicker—ghostly images of what once was superimposing over the devastation.  

Then, just as suddenly, the vision fades. The key is just a key again. The wind dies. The world is still.  

I close my fingers around it and look up. The first star of the evening winks into existence above me. And I know, somehow, that this is not the end. It’s a beginning.
