I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and wildflowers.  My feet hover above a cobblestone street that dissolves into a mosaic of starlight.  A streetlamp flickers, not with electricity but with the pulse of a beating heart, casting shadows that twist into ephemeral creatures—wisp-tailed foxes, winged otters—that dart between the birch trees whose bark glows with neon-green lichen.  I hear a symphony: a thousand cicadas trilling in syncopated harmony, accompanied by the thrum of a heartbeat syncing with my own.  A map unfolds in my hand, etched in silver ink that glows when I breathe on it.  The compass rose points not north, but toward a constellation that forms an ancient spiral.  As I follow it, the street signs transform into constellations, guiding me to a door made of liquid mercury.  Inside, a library floats in a sea of liquid starlight, books drifting like kelp in gentle currents.  When I touch a book, the pages become a film—vivid, intoxicating—of a future where I’ve mastered the art of alchemy, turning my doubts into gold leaf, weaving them into tapestries that tell the story of my journey.  The librarian, a being of stardust and constellations, smiles.  “Your hunches,” she says, her voice a melody of wind chimes and distant thunder, “are the alchemical fire that forges truth.”  I nod, feeling the truth of it seep into my bones, and the library begins to spin, the books becoming comets, hurtling toward a new dawn that blooms from the center of my own chest.  The dream fades, leaving me with the certainty that intuition is not a soft skill, but the language of the universe speaking directly to my soul.
