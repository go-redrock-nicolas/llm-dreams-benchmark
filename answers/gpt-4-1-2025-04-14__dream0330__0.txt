I am dreaming. find yourself standing at the threshold of a house that seems both ancient and eternal, its doors sculpted with mysterious runes that shimmer as if breathing. The air is redolent with scents unlike any you’ve known—rich, spicy, layered with something floral and elusive. Your partner, glowing with excitement, squeezes your hand and ushers you inside.

The family greets you in a swirling chorus of greetings—some verbal, some sung, and some expressed only with a graceful movement of the hands. Each gesture is intricate: fingers unfurl like petals, hands cross over the heart, a gentle bow is exchanged. You wonder: do you bow, or wave, or smile? Your partner whispers in your ear, “Follow my lead.” So you do—a living shadow, mirroring movements foreign yet strangely beautiful.

In the candle-lit living room, everyone sits not on chairs but on a great tapestry embroidered with vibrant threads that tell a story—knights, rivers, blooming trees—spilling color across the floor. Instead of serving one dish, the family passes around tiny glass bowls of powdery spices, each meant to be sprinkled over your tongue before the meal. As you try this ritual, flavors bloom in your mouth—hot, then sweet, then a deep, lovelike warmth that fills your chest.

The conversation flows, punctuated by bursts of laughter and long, thoughtful silences. At first you hesitate—when to speak, when to listen?—but soon you surrender to the rhythm, letting your words rise when they will and drift away when silence falls. Their questions, gentle and curious, seem to see straight into your soul.

Later, the family gathers around an old, ornate instrument—a stringed thing that hums like a river when plucked. Everyone sings—a melody so haunting and unfamiliar that it sends a shiver through your bones. Even though you fumble with the tune, the family welcomes your voice, and together your song becomes part of their harmony.

As the dream night deepens, you feel the gap between your worlds shrinking, stitched closed by curiosity, kindness, and the strange, delicious taste of new beginnings. In this dream, the unfamiliar is no longer something to fear—it becomes a wonder to be cherished, a promise that you and your partner are building something beautiful on the bridge between your two worlds.

When you wake, the memory lingers: a tapestry beneath your feet, a taste blossoming on your tongue, the lingering warmth of a song sung with strangers who, for a moment, felt like family.
