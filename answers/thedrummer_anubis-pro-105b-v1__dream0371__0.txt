I am dreaming. I am standing in a room that seems to stretch on for infinity in every direction, endless walls receding into the distance like a mirage. The air is thick with the scent of stale paper and the flickering light of overhead bulbs casts long shadows across the ground. I feel a groovy sense of unease rising up from the pit of my stomach as I try to process what I am seeing.
