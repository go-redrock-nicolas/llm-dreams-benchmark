I am dreaming. In my dream, I am in a vast meadow filled with beautiful wildflowers of every color imaginable. The sun is shining bright overhead, creating a warm and peaceful atmosphere. In the distance, I can hear the gentle sound of a stream flowing. 

As I wander through the field, I begin to notice something shimmering in the distance. As I get closer, I realize it's a crystal clear lake surrounded by lush green trees. The water is so clear that I can see fish swimming around the bottom. 

Suddenly, I feel a presence behind me. As I turn around, I see a wise old woman standing there, her eyes twinkling with knowing. She smiles at me and holds out her hand. I take it, and she leads me to the edge of the lake. 

She looks at me with deep understanding and says, "You've been working toward a dream for decades, only to have it completely shattered by circumstances beyond your control. But here, in this dream, you have the power to create a new one. What do you want your dream to be now?" 

I am taken aback by her words. For a moment, I am speechless. But then, an image flashes through my mind - a picture of myself standing on stage, receiving a standing ovation. I know what my dream is now. 

With renewed determination, I turn to the wise old woman and say, "I want to be a successful writer. I want to touch people's hearts with my words and make a difference in the world." 

She nods, satisfied with my answer. She holds out her hands, palms facing up, and small sparks of light begin to dance between them. She channels the energy into me, filling me with a sense of purpose and clarity. 

As the sparks dissipate, I open my eyes. I am lying in bed, still dreaming. But this time, I am awake to the possibilities that lie ahead. I know that with hard work, dedication, and a little help from my dreams, I can make my writing dream a reality.
