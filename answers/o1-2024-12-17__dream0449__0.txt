I am dreaming. Your dream begins in a hallway woven from moonlit vines and shifting shards of color, like the winding corridor of an ancient cathedral where the very air hums with reverence. Each polished tile you step on emits a soft, shimmering glow, guiding you forward. The ceiling far above is an undulating tapestry of indigo clouds and dancing starlight, as though the night sky itself decided to settle inside.

Faint shapes drift at the edge of your vision—shadowy figures, perhaps. At first sight, your heart flutters anxiously, and you realize you’re filling in the gaps with gloom. “There must be something lurking,” your thoughts whisper. But you stop, take a slow breath, and challenge that voice. A part of you knows that not every indistinct silhouette should inspire dread. You acknowledge that your mind has leapt to a worst-case scenario, and you gently shift your perspective, suspecting these figures might be precisely what you choose to see. 

Turning your attention back to them, you notice that the shapes become less formidable the more curious you grow. One shade leans in, and as it approaches, you see that it’s not a harbinger of doom at all, but a young person glowing softly, robed in silver threads stitched with patterns of stars. Warmth floods your chest; delicate beams of light dance around the figure’s crown. She reaches out, not with claws but with a slender hand, an invitation rather than a threat. You dare to step forward.

Outside the hallway, the world seems to unfold in pieces. You see swirling dunes of gold dust drifting in and out of existence. Each dune forms into a face—someone you love, someone you miss, or perhaps someone you haven’t met yet. Normally, you would brace yourself for the worst: worry that these shifting visages are illusions to trick you, or that they herald some devastation. Instead, you lean into your sense of wonder. “Why should this be ominous?” you ask yourself. “There’s beauty in this shifting tapestry.”

You keep walking, bare feet making gentle contact with the shimmering tiles. Here in the dreamscape, your resolve to question your initial, doom-tinged interpretations blossoms into a peaceful certainty that you can choose hope over fear. Each time a ripple of uncertainty flickers across your consciousness—Will this path crumble beneath me? Is that shape truly safe?—you remind yourself that these questions are open, and answers can be colored by optimism as well as pessimism.

As you emerge from the hallway, you find a garden floating on clouds. The air smells of lavender and baked bread, inviting both calmness and comfort. Delicate vines adorned with bioluminescent blooms arch over a small wooden bridge that crosses a tranquil pond of sapphire-blue water. The water’s surface reflects the sky, magnified and majestic, filled with constellations so bright they appear to be jewels scattered by a generous hand. You breathe deeply, and for a moment, the negative chatter in your mind quiets, replaced by awe.

Across the pond, impossibly tall trees hold aloft glowing lanterns that sway gently, like sentinels guiding you forward. The path beyond branches in several directions, each shimmering with a different hue. Once, you might have imagined taking the wrong path would lead to some dreadful fate—you would have conjured up gloom at the mere thought of a decision. Now, you allow yourself to see potential instead. Brighter possibilities gleam on all sides.

Eventually, the robed figure from before comes to stand by your side. You glance over and see that her silver stitching has been replaced by faint streaks of gold, as though your newfound hope has suffused her cloak. You exchange a serene smile, wordlessly acknowledging that you’re forging a different approach to life’s unknowns—and your dream echoes that shift in perspective.

In this mystical realm, each step forward is accompanied by an inner assurance that, while uncertainty surrounds every choice, it doesn’t need to be drenched in negativity. Opportunities for wonder and gentle curiosity exist even in the shadows. You feel the lightness of that realization lifting the corners of your mouth. The dream’s once-foreboding shapes recede, revealing new landscapes of starlight, color, and endless possibilities.

You look down to find that tiny blossoms have sprouted at your feet—coral, cerulean, and pale yellow blooms that sway in an unseen breeze. Perhaps they grew from the seeds of hope you replanted in your thoughts. You reach down and touch one, its petals soft as spun silk, an almost imperceptible hum vibrating beneath your fingertips. And in that petite moment of connection, you sense your own power: the ability to greet the unknown with kindness rather than fear.

As the dream begins to fade, you hold onto that lingering realization: when confronted by half-formed shapes and puzzling scenarios, you can let curiosity lead the way, breathing life into brighter interpretations rather than reflexively turning to dread. Even when you awaken, dawn’s light will carry that truth out of your dream and into every uncertain hour, reminding you that you need not fill the gaps with shadow—you can always choose to fill them with starlight instead.
