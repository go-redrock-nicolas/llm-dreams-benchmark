I am dreaming. I see warning signs of an impending public emergency that others haven't recognized yet.  As my heart races and adrenaline surges, I feel a sense of danger and urgency. 

I hear strange sounds coming from the sky.  I see unusual shapes and colors in the clouds.  I smell burning and choking fumes in the air.  I taste bitterness and metal on my tongue.  I touch rough and rocky ground beneath my feet. 

I sense invisible forces at work.  I feel powerful emotions welling up inside me.  I imagine dark scenarios unfolding around me. 

I know that something big is about to happen.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know how it will affect me and others.  I only know that I need to be prepared.  I need to find a safe place where I can shelter myself until the storm passes by.  I need to connect with those who care about me so we can support each other through this difficult time. 

I wish I could wake up from this dream and live my real life again.  But maybe there is something valuable about experiencing these extreme emotions and situations that I haven't encountered before. Maybe they will make me stronger, wiser, better than ever. 

Maybe they will show me who I really am
