I am dreaming. I find myself underwater in a vibrant and colorful coral reef. The fish swim around me in mesmerizing patterns, their scales shimmering in the soft light that filters down from above. Suddenly, I notice a small baby turtle trying to make its way to the surface. It's struggling against a strong current and I feel the urge to help it.

Without thinking, I swim over to the turtle, scooping it up in my hands. As I move closer to the surface, the water becomes clearer and the sun warms my skin. When we break through the water's surface, the turtle snuggles into my neck, safe and secure.

Overwhelmed with emotion, I realize that this tiny creature reminds me of myself when I was younger â€“ small, vulnerable, and in need of protection. The feeling of connection and responsibility towards the turtle is immense, and I feel my heart swell with love and compassion.

As I continue to float on the ocean surface, holding onto the turtle, I understand that this dream is not just about rescuing the turtle but rather about acknowledging and embracing my own inner child and the emotions that come with it. It's a moment of self-discovery and acceptance, where I finally allow myself to feel fully human and connected to all living beings.
