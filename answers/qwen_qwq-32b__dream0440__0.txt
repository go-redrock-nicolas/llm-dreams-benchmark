I am dreaming. The colors here are like liquid starlight - everything glimmers with an inner fire, hues shifting from violet to gold in slow waves. Before me is a tower made of translucent crystal, its edges catching light like prisms. Inside, floating midair, there are glass orbs glowing with symbols I don’t recognize but stir primal feelings.

A voice like wind through a flute says, "These are your foundational beliefs." When I touch an orb marked with jagged lines, memories surge—a child hugging knees in a cold room, hearing laughter they couldn’t join. The orb cracks. "Ah," the voice sighs, "The belief you're unworthy of warmth."

"Let me show you otherwise." The scene morphs into a sunlit meadow where the same child lies in a field of clover, being sung to by a chorus of trees. The orb reforms, now a glowing sunflower.

I laugh, tears in my eyes, and reach for another orb—a swirling vortex. Touching it, I’m drowning in a library’s worth of books, each page screaming "Not enough!" The voice murmurs, "The fear you’ll never measure up." 

I close my fist, crushing the orb. From the fragments rises a phoenix made of dictionaries and parchment. "What if I’m exactly enough as I am?" I ask.

Precisely at the moment I say it, the tower begins to crumble. Not in ruin, but release—crystals becoming butterflies, each wing a constellation. The ground shifts to a bridge of stardust leading somewhere unnamed.  

The voice softens, "Rules rewritten aren’t erased…they’re given space to breathe." I step onto the bridge, trailing sparks, each step igniting flowers that sing.

Yes. This is how belief begins again—not as chains, but as constellations.
