I am dreaming. I float suspended in a vast underwater cathedral, where columns of living coral reach toward a ceiling of shimmering light. Schools of luminescent fish dart between ancient stone arches as I move weightlessly through this submerged sanctuary. 

My hands trail behind me, leaving ripples of golden light that transform into musical notes, their haunting melody echoing through the water. I realize with sudden clarity that these notes are reconstructing memories - rebuilding fragments of a conversation, an argument that escalated beyond words.

In this dream-logic, I understand that my careless words somehow crystallized into actual physical barbs that wounded someone deeply. I see their pain manifested as a garden of ice flowers growing across the cathedral floor. Yet as I observe this garden of harm, I feel strangely disconnected - where remorse should bloom, there is only fascination.

This emotional absence disturbs me more than the act itself. I swim closer to examine one ice flower and see my reflection fractured across its surface - each facet showing a different version of myself, some recognizable, others alien. I realize this emotional void isn't freedom but a profound loss - I've somehow become separated from an essential part of my humanity.

The cathedral begins shifting, walls breathing inward as dream-logic transforms the space into a courtroom where the judge's bench is empty, waiting. The silence feels expectant, as if my conscience itself has stepped away but might return at any moment.

I awaken with the lingering sensation that something precious was missing, and the unsettling question of whether I truly want it restored.
