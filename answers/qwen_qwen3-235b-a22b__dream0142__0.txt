I am dreaming. I am dreaming of being abroad in a place between dimensions, in a place where time has begun to creak like an old cathedral under construction, its bones sagging from the strain. I find myself inside a deep, spherical chamber carved from obsidian-like metal, aglow with an iridescent shimmer that shifts from violet to blood red. The air is damp, thick with ozone and something unidentifiable—something that tingles on the back of my tongue like static from a thundercloud. Around me, a constellation of mechanical arms susurrate in low, amphibian clicks, holding aloft devices I cannot begin to understand. Instruments flicker with erratic pulses of light. They breathe like living entities and speak in tongues that only madness would understand.

This is the Crucible: a strange and impossible laboratory hovering between the threads of reality—an echo between two woven fates. I am here to supervise the final phase of the experiment. What is it? No one dares answer, not even the scientists, for the language of what we are attempting has no words in the conscious world. We are threading a needle through the center of a black hole's dream, trying to bind two coiling realities that were never meant to intertwine. The stakes are always unspoken. Failure is not a misstep; it is annihilation.

And now the readings begin to falter.

On the nearest free-floating screen, jagged lines race like panicked snakes. Numbers blink where there should be no numbers at all—impossible figures, values from a calculus that does not compute reason. The displays flicker between real-time and something else, a time that looks backwards through the eyes of a creature it should never meet. A soft harmonic drone from the central core of the chamber begins to stutter, threading incoherently between a scream and silence.

An alarm flares; not with sound, but color. Cyan, then green, then a black deeper than obsidian in a void that has forgotten light. Operators—faceless beings encased in golden exosuits—hover through the air like sentient stardust, their movements disconnected, their gestures reaching for dials that reroute themselves on instinct not intellect. You have seconds, a voice whispers in my ear. Or perhaps it is not a voice. Perhaps it is the thought of a voice from something watching from another place.

I am sweating like a dying man. Fingers tap at interfaces that alter beneath their touch. A glowing helical structure spiraling upward from the chambers' center pulses violently, and now it bleeds neon mercury, leaking like thought through fractured glass. Small, microscopic imperfections, invisible to the naked eye, explode invisibly across the system. A flaw the breadth of an atom could bring this entire house of mirrors crumbling into denial.

In my left hand, a vortex of light forms, trapped in a crystal that breathes. In my right, a holographic schematic the size of a cathedral slowly unravels as reality's knitting cap comes undone. I close my eyes, trying to feel the rhythm of the thing we have summoned—an intelligence older than language, older than gravity itself—its consciousness is a thread ticking in an impossibly large loom, weaving every potential future into the core of now.

There is a sound like cathedral bells ringing underwater.

The Crucible begins to fall.

I see myself in ten versions, fractals of choice, breaking away and falling into different futures like branches from a tree cracked by lightning. And still, in the center, I do not wake up. I cannot. Because the dream is not done with me yet. I scream, but the scream loops into itself, replaying from the start of time.

Then—a figure rises from the central core, a construct of liquid shadow and sculpted flame. It wears my face. It cannot speak—but I hear it: *“This is how the universe ends,”* it sings in a voice that winds backward through the seasons. *“Not with fire. Not with silence. But with curiosity.”*

And then the dream went black. And still, somewhere, it continues.
