I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, thick and golden, as if the sky itself has melted into a syrupy mist. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all but towering spirals of glass, their translucent trunks filled with swirling galaxies. Each step you take crunches on a ground that shifts between velvet moss, shards of mirror, and liquid shadow. You do not question it. You *lean in*.  

A creature trots past—a fox with the face of a forgotten god, its eyes twin prisms refracting light into colors you’ve never named. It pauses, tilting its head, and you feel the weight of its gaze not on your skin but *inside* your ribs, rearranging your thoughts like scattered puzzle pieces. You do not flinch. You *wonder*.  

The horizon ripples. Mountains rise and fall in the span of a breath, their peaks dissolving into flocks of ink-black birds that scatter letters of an unknown alphabet across the sky. You catch one—a feathered glyph that burns cold in your palm—and it whispers a riddle in a language of sighs and static. You do not demand answers. You *listen*.  

A river materializes beneath your feet, not of water but of liquid memory. You wade in, and the past floods your mouth: a childhood room you never had, a lover’s face you’ve never seen, a grief that isn’t yours yet feels intimately familiar. You do not drown. You *taste* the ache, let it color your veins like indigo ink.  

Above, the moon splits open like an egg, revealing a pulsing core of raw, white silence. From it descends a staircase woven from spider silk and starlight, leading to a door that breathes. The door is your own heartbeat, your own childhood, your own unspoken fear of being too much and not enough. You do not turn away. You *ascend*.  

Inside the door, there is no room—only a garden of clocks, each ticking backward, roots burrowing into hourglasses filled with ash and fireflies. A figure tends to them, their hands melting like wax, reshaping into doves, into keys, into questions. They offer you a seed that thrums with the memory of a song you’ve never heard but already know by soul. You do not plant it. You *hold it*, letting its possibilities tremble against your pulse.  

The dream begins to fray at the edges, not with fear or violence but with the soft unraveling of a thread pulled from a tapestry. You do not clutch at the visions. You let them go, let them dissolve like sugar on the tongue of dawn.  

When you wake, the seed is gone. But your hands smell of loam and lightning, and somewhere in your chest, a door you never knew existed is now ajar, creaking gently in the wind of your breath.  

You do not close it. You *step closer*.
