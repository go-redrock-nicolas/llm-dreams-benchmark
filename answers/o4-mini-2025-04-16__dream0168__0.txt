I am dreaming. You close your eyes and suddenly find yourself perched atop a moltenglass tower that trembles with every distant roar. In your hands is a battered, bronzefiligreed console—its dials spinning erratically, its screens flickering with halfglimpsed emergency maps. All around you, three catastrophes unfold at once:   
  
1. A seething wall of flame races along a crystalline forest, its leaves chittering like hot coins.  
2. A tidal wave—black as spilled ink—rushes inland, swallowing bridges and rooftops in a single gulp.  
3. A howling hurricane tornado grinds through a coastal city, tearing streetlamps from their sockets like matchsticks.  
  
Your voice crackles through a dozen radio handsets, but each time you bark an instruction—“Divert the water pumps! Send aerial units!”—the lines sputter, pop, then vanish in a puff of violet smoke. The air tastes of ozone and metallic fear. Your heart pounds in time with the tower’s tremor. Lives hang in the balance.  
  
You sweep one gauntleted hand across the console—hoping to reroute power to the backup transmitters—and suddenly the tower’s scales of light shift. The monitors scroll in reverse, revealing a fourth crisis: a chemical plant in meltdown, its tanks bleeding rainbowhued steam into the sky. You feel the acrid mist brush your cheek.  
  
Time bends. The console implores you to choose:  
• Channel scarce firefighting drones to the forest, or divert them to cool the chemical vats before they erupt?  
• Snap your fingers at the wave—commanding the city’s floodgates open—or sacrifice the levees to save the high-rise hospital?  
• Hunt the funnel cloud with tracking balloons, or marshal all available rescue choppers north of the eye?  
  
Your breath catches. In the periphery, ghostly silhouettes of civilians flicker—some pounding on shattered windows, others clutching small children, their faces illuminated by strobing emergency lights. A single wrong decision could mean a hundred lost souls.  
  
With a crackling exhale, you lay a trembling fingertip on the console’s largest dial—its edge etched with runes that glow ivory. The tower shudders. All around you, disaster and salvation teeter on a knife’s edge—and in that suspended moment, you… embark on the boldest gambit your dreammind can muster. You reroute power simultaneously to the fire drones and floodgates, summon an improvised sky-bridge of rescue nets beneath the spiraling tornado, and channel every ounce of telepathic will into stabilizing the chemical vats—all as the world around you fractures, reassembles, and holds its breath, waiting to see if your fractured commands will turn chaos into hope.
