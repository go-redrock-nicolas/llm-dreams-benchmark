I am dreaming.

A silvery mist swirls around my feet as I drift through a grand, gothic city sculpted from moonlight and shadow. The buildings bend toward me, stretching tall windows ablaze with curious golden glows, watching, waiting. I sense the hearts of the passersby glowing dim and bright beneath their ribs—a nervous student with trembling hands, an exhausted merchant clutching tarnished coins, a cloaked figure whose heart tapers to a thin, flickering thread.

With a thought, I become the melody in the air—a whisper in their minds. I brush soft fingers across their secrets, understanding instantly what makes them fear, ache, and crave. Their desires lay themselves bare to me—longing for approval, yearning for rest, desperate to be loved. If I will it, I can make the proudest noble forget his name or the stubborn guard hand over his heavy ring of keys.

Yet as I walk, my control feels effortless, almost like breathing. I watch a crowd gather at the base of a marble staircase and, with a smile, nudge their hopes and doubts—causing them to part like water, paving a path ahead of me. Faces alight with awe or confusion as they sense their own hidden weaknesses trembling under my invisible touch. It is as if the city itself bows, both wary and eager before my presence.

I realize the giddiness of power, but also an aching, hollow echo that stirs at the fringe of my heart. Is this control, or is it loneliness? I reach out to a lonely poet, and with a thought, grant her confidence—her pen blazing across pages as she composes verses. I toy gently with a weeping child’s fear, soothing it away and watching peace bloom in her tear-streaked face. Everywhere I turn, I see the endless dance between manipulation and mercy.

The city sighs around me, caught in twilight. I understand now that with every mind I touch, I shape the world not only for myself but for all who dwell within it. Their trust is delicate as spun glass, their weaknesses both a doorway and a mirror.

I stand at the heart of my luminous, labyrinthine dream—power humming at my fingertips—and wonder, in the magical stillness: What will I shape next, with this strange gift of command?
