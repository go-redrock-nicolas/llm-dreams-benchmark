I am dreaming. In my dream I find myself standing on a grand stage, before an expansive auditorium filled to capacity with some of the most influential and powerful people in my industry. The air is electric with anticipation as all eyes focus on me, awaiting the groundbreaking presentation that could make or break my career. My heart pounds in my chest, a mixture of excitement and palpable fear.

With trembling hands, I reach for the stack of meticulously prepared notes and slides upon the podium before me. But as I flip through page after page, a cold sweat breaks out across my brow. The words swim before my eyes, blurring and shimmering like a mirage in the desert heat. And then it hits me - the dreadful realization that my.rendered perfectly flaunt fundamental errors and glaring contradictions throughout. My stomach lurches as I grasp the magnitude of what I am about to unveil to this sea of important faces.

Panic rising like bile in my throat, I try desperately to flip back to the beginning to start again, but it's too late. The clock is ticking and the holographic timer projected behind me counts down the final seconds. Before I canÂ ake a sound, the wizened head of the panel speaks, his voice booming through the hall: "We're waiting, my dear. Proceed when you're ready."

Trapped and paralyzed by indecision, I open my mouth but no words come out. Just as I'm about to concede defeat, a figure materializes on the stage beside me. It's an ethereal, shimmering apparition - a manifestation of my deepest insecurities and doubts given form. The crowd gasps and murmurs, unsure if this is part of the act or a genuine phantom.

My nightmare Visitor leans in close, its breath cool against my skin as it whispers in a hollow, echoing tone: "You've failed, Carolyn. Your career is over. All your hard work... for nothing. They'll remember you as the fraud you are."

Hot tears prick at my eyes as I avert my gaze, unable to meet a single stare in the audience. I am lost, adrift on an ocean of self-doubt. But then... I feel a gentle pressure on my shoulder and hear a soft voice: "You've got this, Carol. I believe in you."

Spinning around, I am shocked to find my childhood self standing there, not quite three years old and so full of innocent optimism and hope. My spirit guides me, placing a small, chubby hand in mine and squeezing reassuringly. And just like that, I am five years old again, my entire life ahead of me filled with boundless potential. The fears and worries of adulthood peel away like layers of armour and I stand tall and unafraid, ready to share my vision with the world.

My first words, unsoiled by the doubts of womanhood, ring out clear and true: "Ladies and gentlemen - I am here today to change the world. Are you with me?"

The crowd leaps to their feet, a deafening cheer erupting from their unified throats. Together, we are united, ready to achieve greatness. Because everything I have, I have within my soul. And nothing can stand in my way.

With that, I wake with a start, my own festival of triumphant applause middle of my chest leaving me panting and sweating. I gaze around my dark bedroom, my heart settling as I realize where I truly am. A dream. It was only a dream. But as I lay my head down, I can't help but believe that somewhere deep down, I am her. The girl she became... and the woman I was born to be.
