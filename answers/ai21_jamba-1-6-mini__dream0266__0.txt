I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the experience defies explanation. A prism of celestial light fills the sky, radiating every color known and unknown. The air is alive with whispers, not of voices, but of thought. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, infinite desert. The sand beneath my feet glitters like gold, and each grain pulses with its own faint rhythm.

Suddenly, a figure appears before me, shrouded in a shimmery cloak that seems to change color as it moves. The figure beckons me to follow, and without hesitation, I do. We walk for what feels like an eternity, the horizon never nearing, the figure never slowing. The air grows colder, and the colors of the prism begin to fade, replaced by a pure, blinding white light.

We reach a clearing. At its center, a colossal tree stands, its roots reaching into the earth, its branches bowing to the heavens. The figure stops, pointing to the tree. Words form in my mind, but without sound, "This is the Tree of Life. Each branch holds a story, a memory, a hope. Choose a path."

I look up, mesmerized, seeing the countless branches, each with a glowing, shimmering fruit. Each fruit feels like a memory, a choice, an outcome. I reach out for one, a golden apple. As I touch it, a shockwave travels through the ground, and I fall into darkness.

I awaken, clutching my room's bed sheets, the image of the Tree of Life etched vividly in my mind. Did I change the world, or was it just a dream?
