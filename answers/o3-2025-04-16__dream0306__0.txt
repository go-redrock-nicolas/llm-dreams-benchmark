I am dreaming. …find yourself standing atop an impossible bridge in the night sky, a silver span arcing between two floating continents of crystal. Below, dark space yawns like an ocean of velvet ink, dotted with tiny suns that pulse in rhythm to your heartbeat.

The continent behind you glows with the warm colors of a memory: cottages made of cedar and candle-stubs, laughter drifting up from windows, the smell of bread and fresh earth—everything you call home, everything that shaped your core beliefs. The continent ahead blazes cold and neon, its towers forged from mirrored glass that flashes with potential: uncountable fortunes, invitations from powerful strangers, comforts so sweet they nearly taste of sugar in the air.

As you step forward, the bridge begins to thin. Each plank underfoot is inscribed in silver filigree with one of your guiding values—honesty, compassion, courage, loyalty, humility. With every stride, a wind of glittering coins whistles past, trying to distract you. “Let go of a plank,” the wind murmurs. “Drop just one of these cumbersome words, and you’ll travel faster, arrive richer.”

Your pulse quickens. You look over the edge. Far below, you see the shimmering image of yourself years ahead, living in a high palace of convenience, surrounded by luxuries that have no scent or warmth. In that reflection you are smiling, but your eyes are mirrors, reflecting nothing. A pang grips you—an ache both of envy and of dread.

From the other side, a figure approaches: tall, cloaked in woven starlight. When it draws near, you realize it wears your face, but older—weather-lined yet bright-eyed. It extends a hand and shows you a scar that traces the length of its palm. “I paid dearly for every plank I kept,” the elder-you whispers. “But each scar is a seed that grew into a forest of meaning.”

The bridge quivers. One plank—Humility—splinters behind you, torn away by the greedy wind. You feel a brief surge of ease: the span feels shorter now, the path quicker. Yet inside, a subtle hollowness blooms.

You close your eyes and reach into the pocket of your dreamcoat. Your fingers brush something small: a single acorn carved from moon-stone, given to you long ago by someone who believed in the best version of you. The acorn’s tiny weight reminds you of campfires, promises, and star-dusted childhood oaths. You set it gently on the next plank—Compassion—and the wood grows thicker, glowing from within, anchoring itself more firmly to the bridge. Immediately the greedy wind recoils, shrieking.

You realize: every time you reinforce a value instead of surrendering it, the bridge becomes stronger, though the journey slows and the storms grow fiercer. You straighten your back, inhaling the cold, electric air. Ahead, the neon spires tilt, flickering. Behind, the cottage lights flare brighter, as if cheering you on.

The elder-you smiles, steps aside, and vanishes into soft sparks. The bridge steadies. Around and above, the stars rearrange themselves into a quiet constellation that resembles an open hand—five fingers, five planks. You place your foot forward, choosing to bear the cost. In this dream between continents, you understand: progress purchased by the erosion of your values may reach its destination, but it will never truly arrive.

You walk on, slowly, purposefully—each plank lighting beneath your stride, refusing to be bought, refusing to be broken.
