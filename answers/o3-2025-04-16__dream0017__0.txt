I am dreaming. …let it fill every forgotten corridor of your lungs.  
The bad news is still there, a black envelope pulsing in your palm, but the moment that breath settles, the envelope peels open of its own accord. Instead of words, a single silver feather drifts out, twirling downward like a slow-motion meteor.

You follow it.

The ground beneath you, once a carpet of cracked linoleum, undulates into a shoreline—opal sand that glitters as though each grain remembers starlight. The tide hums a lullaby in an impossible key. With every exhale, the waves retreat; with every inhale, they return, bright with bioluminescent swirls that sketch soft runes at your feet.

You glance up.

A sky of midnight indigo, stitched with undulating ribbons of emerald and rose, answers back. Though no sun hangs there, the night glows warm, as if the horizon itself is secretly aflame. Far away, mountains carved from amethyst rise and fall like crystalline heartbeats.

The feather lands on the sand and becomes a doorway—no, a KEYHOLE—etched into thin air. You feel the pocket of your dream-coat and discover a matching key: carved from translucent amber, still warm with the memory of tree-sap. Inserting it, you hear a click, like two halves of a broken sentence finally meeting.

The keyhole blossoms into a circular portal. On its threshold grows a field of dandelions taller than cathedral spires, their golden heads softly roaring with whispers: “Choose wonder.” Their stalks sway aside, inviting you.

You step through.

Suddenly you are weightless, suspended inside a colossal library bored into the trunk of an endless redwood. Every shelf crawls with glowing books. Some flutter like butterflies, their wings paper-thin; others snore lightly, dreaming their own unfinished chapters. A friendly hush cushions the space, the sound of imagination breathing.

A librarian—part lynx, part grandmother—regards you over half-moon spectacles. She gestures, and the bad news you received earlier materializes as a single, tarnished volume in her paw. She strokes its spine, and the darkness flakes away like ash, revealing an inner cover painted with sunrise clouds.

She presses the book into your hands. “Stories can scar,” she purrs, “but you may rewrite the punctuation.” Her whiskers twitch. “Would you like a quill forged from moonbeams?”

You nod. The quill appears—cool as ice, bright as wonder. You open the book. Inside, your fear is written in frantic ink: jagged, breathless, desperate. Yet when the moon-quill touches the page, the letters soften, curve, transform. Sentences blossom into paths; commas bend into stepping-stones; periods become lanterns.

Line by line, you turn tragedy into testimony, sorrow into soil for wilder joy. As you write, vines of luminous ivy creep from the margins, knitting the torn paper back together. The pages now smell of rain on a summer orchard.

You close the book. Its cover is no longer black but woven sunrise: saffron, blush, and lavender. When you return it to a shelf, the spines around it shine a little brighter, as though grateful to witness resilience.

The librarian bows. “Remember,” she says, voice like velvet snowfall, “news is a seed; it grows what you water.”

You float backward through the portal, the grand dandelions showering you with their feather-seeds. Each seed ignites into a firefly, swirling around you, illuminating your path back to that opal shoreline. The silver feather still waits, but now it’s pure light—and when you touch it, it dissolves, a final sigh of relief.

You inhale again.

The beach folds into origami and tucks itself into your chest pocket. You exhale, and the whole dream becomes a single bright pulse in your heartbeat—a compass made of calm.

Then you wake, sheets cool, dawn making stained-glass of your curtains, and realize that somewhere in the vaults of sleep, you learned the secret art of breathing storms into gardens.
