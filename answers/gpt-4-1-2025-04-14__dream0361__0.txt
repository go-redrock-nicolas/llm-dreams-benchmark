I am dreaming.

The world shimmers with an otherworldly haze—a place suspended somewhere between memory and invention. I find myself at the threshold of an immense, tangled forest that glows with subtle, impossible colors: sapphire moss, lantern-fruits burning with golden light, and the soft indigo of the sky pulsing gently above. In the air, notes of wild jasmine and petrichor weave together, beckoning me deeper.

All around, I sense the lingering voices of caution—echoes of friends and family whose familiar words urge me to turn back. Why chase something intangible? What good is wandering when the path is so uncertain? But the call within me is irresistible. It is not made of logic or practicality; it resonates through bone and blood, intangible but undeniable, like the hush before a storm or the hush of hope rising.

Barefoot, I step into the forest, feeling the earth cool and soft beneath my feet. My guide is a gleaming silver moth, wings patterned like the night sky, flitting just beyond reach. As I pursue it, doubts crowd around, whispering of failure, disappointment, the weight of wasted time. But with every step, the forest becomes more itself—trees arching into cathedral vaults, their trunks shimmering with constellations. The path glows faintly, winding in impossible spirals.

The deeper I venture, the more the external voices fall away, replaced by the steady beat of my own heart. I am chasing something unseen, a pulse in the darkness. I come upon a clearing where the grass glimmers with midnight dew. At its center stands a mirror, tall and rippling with living reflection. In it, I do not see just myself, but all the versions I might have been—hesitant, regretful, contained. Yet here I am: wild-eyed, uncertain, but alive with longing.

I step forward. The silver moth alights on my shoulder. My reflection shifts, and as I reach out to touch the trembling surface, the glass ripples and breaks open—not into shards, but into a portal, warm and beckoning. A realm of possibility seethes beyond: cities of floating bookshelves, rivers singing with music, mountains made of laughter, all born from following the quiet song inside.

And so I leap, heart pounding—not because the leap is safe or wise, but because it is my own. The forest applauds with a thousand rustling leaves, and the world opens around me, vast and inviting, a testament to the wild courage of dreaming true.
