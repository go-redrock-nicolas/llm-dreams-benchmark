I am dreaming. I am in a world that is not my own.  A world where anything is possible.  A world where I can be anyone and anything I want.  

I follow my curiosity down a path that leads me to a beautiful lake surrounded by lush greenery and colorful flowers.  I sit by the lake
and watch the reflections of the sky and trees dance on its surface.  I dip my hand into the water and feel its coolness refresh me.  I
listen to the sounds of birds chirping and insects humming and the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.  I breathe in the scent of
fresh air and damp earth and flowers.  

I imagine myself as a creature who can swim and dive beneath the surface of the water.  I imagine myself as a creature who can fly and
soar through the air.  I imagine myself as a creature who can shape-shift and take on any form I desire.  

I wonder what it would feel like to be such a creature.  I wonder how fast and agile I would be.  I wonder how strong and powerful I
would be.  I wonder how free and liberated I would be.  

I decide that I want to be such a creature.  I decide that I need to be such a creature.  I decide that I am such a creature.  

I stand up and remove my clothes.  I feel the warmth of the sun caress my skin.  I step into the water and immerse myself in its depths.
I close my eyes and let go of all my fears and doubts and insecurities.  

I open my eyes and see a pair of fins emerge from the water next to me.  A tail flicks behind them.  A smile curves my mouth.  

I swim away from the shore and into the open waters of the lake.  I dive down and explore the hidden realms of its ecosystem.  I
encounter schools of fish and colonies of crustaceans and armies of jellyfish.  I play with them and teach them and learn from them.  

I surface again and gaze up at the sky.  I see clouds scudding across it.  I see sunlight filtering through it.  I see stars twinkling in
it.  

I raise my arms and spread my fins wide.  I sing a song that only I can hear.  A chorus of voices joins me.  A celebration erupts
around me.  

I feel alive and vibrant and joyful.  I am dreaming.
