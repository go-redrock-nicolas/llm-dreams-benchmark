I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the dimly lit corridor of an ancient, sprawling building—a labyrinth of crumbling stone walls and cracked marble floors that seem to stretch on for miles. The air is thick with an eerie stillness, punctuated by the distant sound of dripping water echoing through the halls. A faint, musty smell of decay lingers, mingling with the sharp tang of something metallic, perhaps rust or worse. My heart pounds in my chest as I realize I am trapped, surrounded by unseen hazards, and I must find a way out before the dangers close in.

Above me, the ceiling is a jagged mosaic of broken plaster and exposed wooden beams, some of which groan ominously under an unseen weight. Flickering torches line the walls, casting long, wavering shadows that dance like specters, tricking my eyes into seeing movement where there is none. Every step I take reverberates through the empty space, each sound amplified as if the building itself is listening, waiting. My goal is clear: find a safe exit. But with each passing minute, new perils emerge, testing my resolve.

I start down the corridor, my footsteps cautious, my breath shallow. The first hazard reveals itself almost immediately—a massive, rusted iron chandelier dangles precariously from a fraying rope, swaying slightly as if disturbed by an invisible breeze. It looms over the path ahead, its sharp, jagged edges glinting in the torchlight. I can almost hear the groan of the rope fraying further with each second. My gut tells me to move quickly, but I know one wrong step could send it crashing down. I drop to the ground, crawling beneath its menacing shadow, my palms pressing into the cold, gritty floor, my muscles tense. I make it past, the chandelier creaking ominously behind me as if disappointed to have missed its prey.

As I rise to my feet, a low, guttural rumble shakes the building. Dust rains down from above, and the ground beneath my feet trembles. Ahead, the corridor splits into three paths. To the left, I see faint tendrils of smoke curling around the corner, accompanied by the acrid smell of burning wood—an inferno must be raging nearby. To the right, the path descends into a pitch-black stairwell, the darkness so thick it feels almost tangible, swallowing the torchlight whole. Straight ahead, the hallway is partially collapsed, with jagged stones blocking half the passage, but a sliver of light—possibly daylight—seeps through the rubble. My mind races. Fire, darkness, or an uncertain climb? I choose the rubble, praying that light means freedom.

I approach the collapsed section, my hands trembling as I grip the rough edges of the stones. They’re cold and slick with moss, making each movement precarious. As I squeeze through the narrow gap, a sharp edge slices into my arm, and a warm trickle of blood runs down my skin. I grit my teeth, ignoring the pain, focused on the light ahead. But just as I push forward, a new danger emerges—the sound of rushing water, loud and relentless, growing closer. I glance back to see a torrent of dark, frothing liquid flooding down the corridor from where I came, sweeping debris and shattered remnants of the building in its path. It’s coming straight for me, a wall of murky death.

Panic surges through me, adrenaline flooding my veins. I scramble through the rubble faster, jagged rocks scraping against my sides, the searing pain in my arm forgotten. The light ahead grows brighter, and I can now see it’s a shattered window, its frame twisted and bent outward. Beyond it, a jagged cliff edge drops into a foggy abyss, but a narrow ledge runs along the side of the building—a possible escape. Behind me, the water roars closer, its icy spray already soaking my back. I have no choice. I hurl myself through the window, glass shards slicing into my hands as I grip the ledge, my legs dangling over the sheer drop.

The wind howls around me, tugging at my clothes, threatening to pull me into the void below. My fingers ache as I cling to the rough stone ledge, inching my way along. The building shakes again, violent tremors loosening bits of mortar that rain down past me, disappearing into the mist. I can still hear the water inside, now mixed with a new sound—a deep, guttural growl that seems to come from the very walls themselves. Something alive, or perhaps something unnatural, is hunting me within this cursed place. My chest tightens with dread, but I force myself to focus on the ledge, on each precarious step toward what I hope is safety.

Ahead, the ledge widens into a small balcony, its iron railing rusted but intact. Beyond it, I see a rope bridge swaying in the wind, connecting to a distant tower shrouded in mist. It looks fragile, its wooden planks weathered and splintered, but it’s my only chance. As I reach the balcony, I glance back through the broken window. The water has flooded the corridor completely now, and within its dark currents, I swear I see something moving—a shadowy, sinuous shape with glowing amber eyes staring right at me. My blood runs cold. Whatever it is, it’s coming.

I don’t hesitate. I sprint across the balcony and onto the rope bridge, the wooden slats creaking and groaning under my weight. The wind whips around me, the bridge swaying violently as I clutch the frayed ropes for balance. Halfway across, a plank snaps beneath my foot, and I lurch forward, nearly plummeting into the abyss. My hands burn as the rope cuts into them, but I hold on, dragging myself to the next plank. Behind me, the growl grows louder, closer—a sound that vibrates through the air, primal and hungry. I don’t dare look back. I push forward, my vision blurring with exhaustion, my lungs burning with every ragged breath.

Finally, I reach the tower. The door is ajar, and I stumble inside, collapsing to the ground as the bridge behind me sways one last time before a deafening snap echoes through the air. The ropes have given way, plummeting into the void with whatever was pursuing me. For a moment, there is silence. I’m safe—at least for now. The tower is cold and dark, but it feels like a sanctuary after the chaos I’ve endured. My body aches, my mind reels, but I know this isn’t the end. Somewhere deeper in this nightmare, more dangers await. I rise to my feet, steeling myself for whatever comes next, because in this dream, survival is the only option.

And then, as dreams often do, the scene begins to shimmer and shift, the edges of the tower blurring like wet paint on a canvas. But the fear, the adrenaline, the desperate need to escape—it lingers, vivid and unshakable, as I brace myself for the next chapter of this endless, haunting journey.
