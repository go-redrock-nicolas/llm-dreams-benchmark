I am dreaming. I find myself in a landscape quite unfamiliar; around me rises a lush forest glimmering with iridescent leaves under a sky of vibrant colors never before seen in the waking world.  The very air is perfumed with a marvelous melange of scents - exotic spices mingling with the sweet breath of a thousand kinds of flowers. 

In the heart of this fantastic forest, a massive structure towers above the foliage like the ruins of a lost world. It's neither metal nor stone, but something more akin to crystal, emitting a soft effulgence that hums with power and resonates with the pulse of the forest itself.  Every surface is decorated with complex etchings one could spend a lifetime deciphering.

This ancient architectural marvel houses a machine of bewildering sophistication, a tangle of whirring cogs and spinning gears, silver tubes and golden wires weaving in and out of each other in a mesmerizing ballet. Blue flames dance in glass orbs suspended around the machine, casting an otherworldly glow on everything around me. The air is charged with an electric tension, as if the very atmosphere is holding its breath.

A sense of urgency grips me, an innate understanding that I must activate this mysterious apparatus to avert some unspecified doom that looms over this strange realm like a gathering storm. The machine provides no clear instructions or obvious controls, but a whispered voice on the edge of hearing seems to call out to me from the heart of the device.

Listening attentively, I begin to manipulate the machine, my hands moving in patterns that are variations on the labyrinthine designs adorning the walls.  As I do, the various parts of the machine respond, sliding and shifting as if they were always meant to move in this particular manner.  Lights bloom along the wires, racing along the crystalline tubes like shooting stars.

The air itself seems to vibrate with an unknown energy, pulsing with the rhythm of my actions, the indistinct voice growing more distinct, the humming of the machine becoming a symphony of sound that echoes throughout the forest. The glow of the surrounding foliage pulses in synchronicity with the machine until, with one grand, resounding chord, the apparatus comes alive.

A beam of light that defies description erupts from the apex of the machine, soaring upward into the polychromatic heavens. The unexplained danger that had hung over me like dread evaporates in this illuminating radiance, banished by the relic I had somehow known how to operate.  The voice that had guided me now sings in exultation, a paean of victory that my own voice echoes.

The dream fades then, the colors and scents and sounds receding into the realm of Morpheus, but the exhilaration remains, the triumph and wonder of that impossible machine echoing in my heart as I awaken.
