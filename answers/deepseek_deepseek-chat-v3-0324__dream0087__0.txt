I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You find yourself standing in a vast, opulent hall that seems to hover between reality and memory—walls draped in deep crimson tapestries, their threads woven with intricate, shifting patterns that tell a thousand silent stories. The air hums with tension, thick as the scent of aged parchment and smoldering incense.  

Around a long, blackwood table sit the warring members of the Valtierre family, their faces half-lit by flickering candlelight. Each wears expressions carved from generations of grudges: the stern matriarch with eyes like flint, the fiery-eyed son whose fingers twitch near the hilt of an ornamental dagger, the aunt who speaks in poisoned honey, and the exiled uncle who has returned after decades, cloaked in shadow and unspoken regret.  

The argument erupts like an uncorked tempest. Voices overlap—accusations, curses, pleas—each word a spark in dry tinder.  

Suddenly, the table between them cracks down the center with a sound like splintering bone.  

From the fissure rises an iridescent mist, swirling into a spectral figure—*her*, the forgotten ancestor whose betrayal started this feud centuries ago. Her ghostly hands stretch toward her descendants, and for a moment, silence grips the room.  

Then the world shifts.  

The hall melts like wax. The floor becomes water beneath your feet, and you sink—not into darkness, but into a submerged cathedral of memories. Around you, scenes from the past unfold in fractured reflections: lovers whispering promises that would become curses, a dagger plunged in moonlight, a child hidden away, a name erased from history.  

A voice, neither male nor female, but vast as the sea, whispers through your mind:  
*"You must choose—cut the thread or let it strangle them all."*  

Before you, floating in the abyss, are two objects:  
- A silver knife, its blade etched with the family crest.  
- A gossamer thread, pulsing like a vein, connecting every beating heart in the room.  

The dream holds its breath.  

What do you do?
