I am dreaming. …let the paint itself decide what reality should look like.

The first bristles kiss the canvas, and a single streak of liquid sunrise spreads outward like molten saffron.  At once the studio windows burst open—though you never remember opening them—and dawn pours in, faster and fiercer than nature intends.  Outside, the streets reel: every clocktower spins backward, shadows unspool, and yesterday’s newspaper lifts from puddles to fold itself into tomorrow’s headlines.

With a turn of your wrist, you dot the streak with indigo.  The speck dilates, grows, becomes a midnight portal.  You lean in, feeling cold constellations breeze across your skin, and you realize you have painted a hole into last night.  Children with kitestring stars tumble out, giggling in reverse, each syllable they speak assembling itself into words only after you’ve heard the echo.

You swipe a broad band of verdant green.  Whole forests sprout in the stroke: trees uncoil like slow fireworks, owls age backward into speckled eggs, and moss rewinds its creeping clock until stone is bare again.  When you drag your finger through the wet paint, the canopy parts and reveals a corridor of seasons—winter dissolving into autumn, leaves stitching themselves back onto limbs, snowflakes returning to clouds as silvery steam.

Your palette knife scoops a sliver of carmine.  One decisive flick, and the crimson arc becomes the curve of a distant horizon.  An ocean rises to meet it, all ruby surf and garnet foam.  The sea claps shut like a book, flattening into a mirror so polished you can read history upon its surface.  Empires unfurl and collapse, lovers find and lose one another, and somewhere the first fish contemplates legs for the second time.

You pause to breathe—paint-scent, ozone, déjà vu—then load the brush with shimmering titanium white.  A single spiral, and gravity forgets its duties.  Pencils drift, chairs levitate like patient balloons, and your own heartbeat scribbles cursive paths through the air.  Suddenly every unfinished song you’ve ever hummed gains wings, fluttering around your head as stanzas of bright origami.

In the corner of the canvas you sign your name, but the letters won’t stay still.  They keep rewriting themselves into questions:  
Who dreams the painter?  
What color is silence?  
How long is forever when it’s framed?

And just as the last question blossoms, the entire painting inhales—yes, inhales—and the room empties into it.  The studio, the city, the sky, even the fluttering songs compress into a single pinpoint of radiant pigment.  You’re left standing before blankness once more, brush in hand, the smell of possibilities stinging your eyes.

A fresh canvas waits.  

And because you can, you smile and raise the brush again.
