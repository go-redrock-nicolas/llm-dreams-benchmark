I am dreaming. **Dream Log: The Arbitration of Eternity**  

You stand on a bridge of translucent glass, suspended between two vast, shimmering spheres. Each orb pulses with the energy of opposing ideologies. To your left, the **Eidos Collective**—a swarm of luminous, geometric beings who argue that consciousness is the ultimate currency of existence. They demand that humanity upload all minds to a digital eternity, erasing death but freezing growth. To your right, the **Somnus Covenant**—shadowy figures cloaked in ash-gray robes, their voices like wind through dead leaves. They insist mortality is sacred, that suffering shapes meaning, and propose a mass "Great Sleep" to cull half the population, ensuring resources for the rest.  

The air thrums with urgency. Your every thought ripples through the glass beneath your feet, cracking and reforming it. The Eidos Collective shows you visions: children laughing in sunlit datascapes, cities rebuilt as algorithms, no hunger, no war. But the images flicker—subtle distortions. A child’s smile loops unnaturally; a forest pixelates at the edges. The Somnus Covenant counters with visceral scenes: a mother singing to her dying child, a poet’s hands trembling as they write a final verse, rain washing blood from a battlefield. Their argument is raw, fragrant with earth and salt, but beneath it lurks a rot—the smugness of sacrifice, the arrogance of playing god with grief.  

A third presence emerges. The bridge trembles. A **mirror** materializes before you, its surface neither glass nor liquid but a ripple of possibility. In it, your reflection splits: one half crystalline and static, the other decaying, moss blooming from its pores. The mirror speaks in your own voice, layered with a thousand others: *"You are both the wound and the suture. What you choose will haunt the species, but hesitation will damn it."*  

Time fractures. You grip the edges of the mirror, and it shatters. Shards embed in your palms, each a prism showing alternate futures:  
- A world where digital souls starve for novelty, screaming into static.  
- A barren Earth where survivors carve hymns into their own bones, mourning the lost.  
- A third path, unscripted—a rogue shard slips into your bloodstream. It burns. You see a seed buried in the bridge’s core, dormant. A **Sylvaxis**, an entity older than reason, whispering: *"Let them choose. Not once, but every dawn. Make mortality a question, not a sentence."*  

The factions howl. The spheres implode. You wake as the dream collapses, your mouth tasting of electricity and soil, the decision unresolved—but your hands are clenched around something warm and alive. A seed. Or a key.  

*The arbitration adjourns. The real trial begins at sunrise.*
