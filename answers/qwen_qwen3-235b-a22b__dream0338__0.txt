I am dreaming. Darkness has peeled away into a place that lies beyond place, a crossroads suspended upon the thinnest veil between what is real and what only longs to be.

I stand on a cobbled square, but the stones are not made of earth or stone—they shimmer like frozen moonlight, forming a mosaic of celestial bodies swirling underfoot. Above, an impossible sky stretches endlessly. No single color governs it—sometimes violet, sometimes steely green, then the shade of ocean depths or the dull gold of aged parchment. My breath clouds, then vanishes like steam from forgotten teacups. The air smells of forgotten lullabies and burning orchids.

Before me are the two paths.

The first unfurls to my right in golden sheets. Each step gleams with polished light, the reflection of a sun I cannot see but only feel. It radiates warmth and memory, like a childhood home long since lost, where the scent of honeyed figs lingers eternally in the air. There is safety here, familiarity and unspoken invitation. Roses bloom without thorns, trees sway without wind. The future promised upon this road is one of comfort: of gardens you never tire of tending, of a favorite chair by a hearth that refuses to sleep. A soft voice sings in harmony with my footsteps, familiar as lullabies yet alien in its cadence, a song that seems half-remembered from a life not your own. It urges me forward gently, with honeyed persistence: *This road will not ask more than you are able to give.*

But to my left, the darkness sings louder.

The other path is stitched from midnight and old storm clouds. It does not gleam with promise, nor offers safety in return. It simply *is*—stretching into an abyss that ripples like ink dropped into milk. There is no comfort here, no songs beneath my feet, only the soundless hum of ancient secrets stirring closer in the dark. Trees rise like frozen monoliths, bark spiraled like snail shells and whispering in tongues lost since before speech was born. The sky narrows above it, folding into a window too narrow for stars but too wide to forget. A river flows beside it, black and singing only of diverging fates.

Each step down this path promises unraveling, shedding the skin of what I know and fear to part with. But also: stars yet unnamed, creatures that only walk the edges of waking, landscapes carved from the dying dreams of forgotten gods. It is a promise of becoming something greater and wilder than I am. It is blistering cold and searing loss. It holds both magic and madness, and perhaps they are the same thing here.

The wind shifts between the two roads—a gust neither warm nor cold, but both at once—and I feel time stretching thin around me, each second quivering like a spiderweb in a slow-motion storm.

The moment clings to me—it is not passing. My heart thrums with possibilities like a thousand hummingbird wings held trembling in my ribs.

*Choose,* Something beyond choice itself urges, with a voice like mirrors shattering and children laughing.

And I step—not forward, but upward—as if gravity remembers mercy, and bridge the two paths with a stair made entirely of falling stars and unspoken dreams.
