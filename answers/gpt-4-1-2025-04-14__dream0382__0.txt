I am dreaming.

In this dream, I find myself perched on the edge of an ancient, weathered pier stretching out over a violet-tinted sea. The world around me is both familiar and startlingly strange—stars wheel overhead in a slow, deliberate ballet, painting the indigo sky in streaks of silver and gold. The air is thick with the scent of salt and something sweeter still, like memories half-remembered.

I sit with my knees hugged to my chest, my gaze drifting over the restless waters. Waves lap gently at the wooden posts, their swells echoing my own shifting emotions. I feel excitement fluttering in my chest, like butterflies rising through the diaphragm, buoyed by the tantalizing pull of possibility. Yet, alongside this effervescence, there is a deep ache—a tender sorrow for what I am about to leave behind.

With each inhalation, the wind brings whispers: fragments of laughter, the tinkling of glasses at an old kitchen table, the soft murmur of a trusted friend. These memories swirl around me, blending seamlessly into the present. I cannot separate the joy from the grief; they interlace like strands of silver and midnight in a woven tapestry.

A distant lighthouse casts a sweeping beam across the sea, illuminating paths both new and unknown. Each flash reveals flickers of childhood—bare feet in soft grass, the first time I watched rain dance against my bedroom window, that bittersweet pang of realizing nothing remains unchanged forever.

I close my eyes, feeling the storm of ambivalence churning inside me. The anticipation for this new chapter quickens my pulse, yet nostalgia for the comfort of the past is an undertow I cannot fully resist. The sensation is not unpleasant; it is tender—melancholic and radiant all at once.

A heron alights beside me, its feathers shimmering in the chromatic moonlight. It gifts me a knowing nod, as if to say, “This, too, is a necessary migration.” I reach out, feeling the coolness of its presence, then stand—unsteady but resolute. The pier beneath my feet wavers gently, accommodating the weight of my decision.

In the dream's sweet suspension, I do not choose to cast off sorrow or seize joy; instead, I gather both in cupped hands, letting them flow over me like the tide, accepting their duality as a sign that I am truly alive and ready to greet the shifting horizon.
