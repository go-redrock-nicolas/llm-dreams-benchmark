I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of cardamom and rain-soaked earth. You open your eyes to a sky stitched with indigo threads and stars that hum in a language older than time. Before you stands a house carved from moonlight and teakwood, its roof arched like the spine of a sleeping dragon. This is your new home, though it feels like a secret stolen from someone else’s memory.  

The family gathers at dawn. They wear robes dyed the color of monsoons—emerald, sapphire, the bruise-purple of twilight—and their voices ripple in a tongue that coils around your ears like smoke. You catch fragments: *“The roots must remember before the branches can grow,”* whispers the grandmother, her hair a braid of silver rivers. *“She carries the wrong stars in her bones,”* murmurs the brother, his eyes sharp as flint. You don’t know how to tell them you’re a mosaic of borrowed maps, a child raised on asphalt and neon, now asked to bloom in soil that smells of myrrh and ancestral ash.  

The rituals begin. At noon, you’re handed a bowl of milk infused with saffron and grief. You drink, though it tastes of questions without answers. At dusk, they paint your palms with henna in patterns that resemble constellations, and you realize these are not decorations but *instructions*—how to kneel, how to apologize to the earth, how to listen to the wind’s slow confession. You fumble. Your hands tremble. The sister, her face a mask of quiet storms, takes your wrist and presses it to the ground. *“Feel the heartbeat,”* she says. You do. It thrums like a buried drum, like a memory your body insists it knows.  

Nights are the hardest. The house breathes when the moon rises, walls shifting like origami, corridors twisting into labyrinths. You wander, chasing shadows that whisper in your native tongue—*“You don’t belong here, you don’t belong here”*—until you stumble into a courtyard where a tree grows upside-down, roots clawing the air, leaves glowing faintly as if lit from within. Beneath it sits the grandfather, carving a flute from bone. He doesn’t look at you when he speaks. *“Every family is a kind of exile,”* he says. *“Even ours.”*  

You learn. Slowly. To braid your hair with marigolds before prayers. To eat with your hands, letting the dal and rice become a language of warmth on your skin. To dance the fire-circle, where each step is a vow: *I will not forget where I came from. I will not fear where I’m going.* The first time you don’t trip, the family claps, not with sound but with the rhythm of their feet stamping the ground—a heartbeat, again, that somehow fits yours.  

But the dream shifts. One morning, you wake to find your skin etched with tattoos you don’t recognize: vines curling around your ribs, a sparrow mid-flight on your shoulder. The grandmother smiles. *“The body remembers,”* she says. You don’t know if she means your new one or the old one, the child who once rode subways and ate cereal for breakfast. You miss the clang of trains. You miss your own silence.  

The final test comes at the equinox. You’re led blindfolded to a river that flows backward, its current glittering with fragments of forgotten names. They ask you to wade in, to let the water decide if you’re theirs. You hesitate. Then you think of the upside-down tree, the flute’s first note, the henna that never quite fades. You step forward. The river is cold, then warm, then nothing at all. When the cloth is torn from your eyes, you see your reflection: a stranger with your eyes, wearing a crown of water lilies and ash.  

They cheer. You don’t know why.  

You wake up gasping, your cheeks wet, the scent of cardamom lingering in your nostrils. For a heartbeat, you swear your palms are stained with henna. You reach for your phone, but the screen flickers with a single word in a script you’ve never seen—  

*Welcome home.*
