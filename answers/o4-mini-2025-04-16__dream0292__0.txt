I am dreaming. Beneath a sky spun from molten sapphires and whispering auroras, I stand at the rim of a crystalline canyon. Each facet of the walls glitters with every memory of my past defeat—fractured hopes frozen in time. Yet somehow, I sense they’ve lost their power over me. Reflecting on my unexpected resilience, I feel a gentle warmth swell in my chest, spreading like sunrise across my ribs.

As I take a step forward, the ground beneath me blooms with living light—pale lilies unfurling in phosphorescent blues and greens, their petals softly humming in celebration. With each footfall, the canyon’s shards rearrange themselves into stepping-stones, guiding me upward. A breeze, scented with honeysuckle and rain, carries a melody of laughter—my own voice, echoing back stronger, more certain.

Above, a bridge woven from golden thread arcs overhead. I climb, each step dissolving a shard of panic or doubt until the wounds I’d thought permanent dissolve into motes of glittering dust that drift away on the wind. At the bridge’s midpoint, I pause. The air vibrates with possibility: unfinished symphonies waiting for my touch, blank canvases thirsting for my brush. There, I realize the setback that once swallowed me whole has become the very fuel for my rebirth.

On the far side, an orchard of living lanterns sways gently under that sapphire sky. I reach out and touch one—warm, pulsing with soft light—and it bursts into petals of firefly-bright hope. As they swirl around me, I laugh, astonished by the speed of this metamorphosis. Each lantern I ignite strengthens my wings, delicate at first but gaining substance with every beat. 

Then I soar. Below, the canyon shrinks into a mosaic of rainbows; above, the auroras part to form a tunnel of gleaming stars. In this moment, I am weightless, propelled by the force of my own persistence. I understand now that what once threatened to bury me has instead become the bedrock of my transformation. And as I glide through this living dream, I carry with me the unshakeable knowledge that no setback—no matter how vast—can hold me down when I choose to rise.
