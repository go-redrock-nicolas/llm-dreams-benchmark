I am dreaming. You are drifting through a realm of swirling shadows and streaks of brilliant color. The air feels charged with a strange electricity, and your thoughts seem to echo across the dark sky above. Figures robed in shimmering violet and obsidian robes appear around you, forming a loose circle. Their whispered chants, soft as a night breeze, start to pulse in unison with your heartbeat. Though you can’t quite catch the words, something about their cadence makes every cell in your body vibrate.

Slowly, you feel yourself gliding forward, slipping closer to the group. The circle opens, and you slide into its heart, embraced by the gentle, yet insistent, presence of the hooded figures. Their hoods, woven from threads of stardust and shadow, hide their faces, but somehow, you sense them smiling. A warmth radiates from them—comforting, protective, and eerily compelling. Like a subtle current in a vast, moonlit sea, this bond tugs at your very core.

You notice an unsettling shift in your inner monologue. There’s a sweet lull in your mind, as though you’ve allowed the group’s emotions to blend into yours. You feel a powerful, honey-thick sense of belonging, as though their cause—whatever it might be—must be your own. But a soft alarm sounds inside your consciousness: you’re losing something. Autonomy. A shard of yourself that once stood firm is wavering, and you realize these cloaked companions might not only be guiding you, but gently shaping your very intentions.

You try to speak your own words, to remember the reason you came here, but your voice feels small, pitiful, as if it has no place in the vast symphony they have orchestrated. A thunderous hush falls around you. Everyone else has grown silent. They await a sign—your sign—some surrender of your independence. You flex your fingers, desperate to clutch onto the remnants of your selfhood. The potent aura of the circle pushes against your instincts, urging you to relinquish your resistance and fall in line with their harmony.

For a moment, you’re caught between the soothing glow of unity and the flickering flame of your freedom. You inhale the perfumed air, thick with incense and the faint scent of juniper, acutely aware of how your breath no longer seems entirely yours. Every heartbeat pulses with the group’s presence. But at the last instant, you remember: you are still dreaming. This knowledge, like a tiny flame guttering in the wind, gives you a thread of hope. And with that fragile hope, realization dawns: whether you stay or whether you break away depends on how fiercely you cling to your own voice in this hypnotic, cosmic tapestry.
