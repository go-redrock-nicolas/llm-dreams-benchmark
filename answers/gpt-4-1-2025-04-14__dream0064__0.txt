I am dreaming. step hesitantly through a set of heavy velvet curtains, their deep blue folds swallowing the outside world behind me. The room I enter glows with honeyed lamplight, walls lined with tapestries that pulse with shifting shades—violets, indigos, emerald greens—like the inside of some vast amethyst geode. 

Around a low, circular table, a few others already sit. They’re silhouettes at first, but as I approach, faces emerge: eyes bright, vulnerable; hands curled around warm clay mugs, breathing out clouds of steam that shape themselves into fleeting images—birds, keys, tiny locked doors that dissipate into the air.

Chairs creak as I take my place. The facilitator, a gentle presence with hair the color of dusk, smiles with genuine warmth. “Welcome,” they say, voice resonant but soft, as if spoken into the hollow of a seashell. “Everyone here knows how it feels—to search in the dark, to build bridges from loneliness.”

One by one, the others introduce themselves, their stories weaving together like spun gold. A man with the trembling hands of a sculptor shares how he’s molded hope out of silence. A woman with silver-threaded braids describes the invisible monsters that haunt her mornings, and a teenager sketches anxious patterns on the tabletop, then looks up and says, “I thought I was the only one who felt this strange.”

When my turn comes, I speak softly at first, words tumbling out like pebbles dropped in a well. I name my burdens—the ones I have borne in secret—and watch the group absorb them, not with judgment but with a familiar nod, a steadying breath. I realize that though the room is quiet, it hums with mutual understanding, a comforting undercurrent that embraces each pain and shapes it into something lighter, workable. 

As the session winds down, there’s a sense of gentle magic in the air; the tapestries shimmer brighter, and the lamplight seems to pour into our chests, illuminating corners of our hearts long kept in shadow. I leave with new friends whose names and faces are impossibly vivid, carrying with me the echo of their laughter and the promise of this secret place—a reminder that support is real, and sometimes, connection finds us in the wildest, most unexpected corners of our dreams.
