I am dreaming. You are standing at the center of an impossibly vast, circular courtyard. The ground is covered in smooth, silver tiles that feel cool beneath your feet, and they reflect the sky above with eerie clarity—almost like standing upon a moonlit lake. Twisting columns of translucent marble curve upward in irregular patterns, supporting no roof that you can discern, yet you’re surrounded by shape-shifting shadows that flicker and dance around you. 

At first, everything feels soundless and still. Then, a hush sweeps across the courtyard like a chill gust of wind, making you shiver. You begin to notice faint silhouettes emerging from behind the leaning pillars and from out of the silvered reflection beneath your feet. One by one, people of all shapes, sizes, and ages appear—each one brimming with a distinct emotional aura. It’s as though their feelings glow in colors around their bodies.

Then you become aware of your new ability: you can feel what they feel. The moment you realize it, an ecstatic flush spreads through your mind, and you sense not only your own curiosity but also the swirl of emotions from this gathering multitude. Fear. Hope. Love. Longing. Anger. Guilt. Relief. Satisfaction. Every feeling coats your awareness in bright, pulsing waves.

Someone steps close—an older woman with sad, gentle eyes that shine in the half-light. Instantly you feel a pang of grief so profound it grips your chest. Yet mingled with her sorrow is a trembling undercurrent of gratitude and resilience, as if she has glimpsed some kind of distant but certain sunrise. Your heart aches with her sadness and warms with her quiet determination. The colors surrounding her hover in a delicate shade of indigo shot through with moonlit silver.

Another figure appears—a young man quivering with electrifying excitement. He’s hardly able to stand still, his restless feet tapping out a frantic rhythm. A blazing tide of enthusiasm surges through you, so thrilling that your whole body vibrates in sync with his mania. It feels like adrenaline lighting up your veins. Crimson sparks flare in the air around him, crackling energy that jolts your senses.

And then, the crowd thickens. You discern a thousand different hues, each signifying distinct worries, hopes, heartbreaks, and joys. A swirling vortex of emotion lashes out in every direction, an ocean of feeling roaring around the courtyard. You are the anchor, the one who can stand at the center of it all. It isn’t just noise—it’s a symphony, every person’s emotional melody weaving into the next.

At moments, it’s overwhelming. Your pulse races. You sense your own mind threatening to fracture under the weight of so many swirling thoughts and passions, like a mirror cracking under too much pressure. Yet something deep inside you—a calm, glowing sphere of soft light—keeps you grounded. With each breath you take, you focus on the core tranquility within, and you find that you can breathe through the chaos. You can gather each wave of feeling and let it ripple through you without destroying you. Instead, it refracts through your own heart and comes out refined, cooled, and clarified, like hot metal tempered in a smithy’s forge.

You see how your awareness radiates a gentle, stabilizing glow back to those around you. People begin to gravitate toward that serenity, though they themselves often don’t understand why. The old woman’s tears seem to fall a bit softer, laced with greater peace. The young enthusiast’s frenetic energy tempers into a more harmonious excitement that continues to light up his eyes. Each face in the crowd still bears its own burden, yet a subtle calm courses among them.

Then, like a hypnotic toll of a distant bell, you hear a single note reverberate in the courtyard. A hush falls across everyone. You perceive each person’s heartbeats settling into a unison rhythm. For a long moment, no one speaks; you only witness the dancing color auras folding together in an exquisite tapestry. You realize that you can help them share these burdens and joys, so nobody has to bear them alone.

Gradually, you become aware of a gentle mist rising from the silver floor. It drifts upward, swirling around your legs, eventually obscuring everything except the empathic glow that illuminates your dream. You savor the miraculous sensation of connectedness flooding your being—a feeling at once delicate and profoundly powerful. 

And in that white haze of emotion and luminescence, you awaken from the dream, heart still pounding with the echoes of others’ hopes and fears, your soul brimming with a new understanding of boundless compassion.
