I am dreaming. I find myself on a stage bathed in harsh spotlight, at what appears to be a climate conference where I've just finished delivering an impassioned speech about the immediate dangers of rising sea levels threatening coastal communities. The audience had been nodding along, and I felt the familiar rush of validation that comes with articulating a cause I've dedicated years to.

But then, a figure rises from the front row—a woman with silver-streaked hair and piercing eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses. She approaches the podium, carrying a thick folder of papers. The microphone squeals as she takes it, and the sound makes me wince.

"Your projections are fundamentally flawed," she says, her voice calm yet resonant. "The data you've been using was compromised by calibration errors in the satellite measurements from 2018 to 2022."

She begins projecting graphs and tables that contraddict everything I've just presented. The lines I claimed showed catastrophic acceleration actually reveal a much more gradual trend when properly adjusted. Communities I insisted would be underwater within a decade might have centuries before facing serious threats.

My throat tightens. My palms grow slick with sweat. Faces in the audience turn toward me, expecting a response. Colleagues I respect look confused, then disappointed. Journalists are already typing furiously on their phones.

For a moment, I consider arguing back, searching for flaws in her presentation, or deflecting with rhetoric about the precautionary principle. The impulse to defend my position feels almost physical, like armor I want to pull around myself.

But something shifts in the dream-space. The room seems to expand and contract with my breath. I look at the data again, and with dream-clarity, I see its truth.

I step back to the microphone. "Thank you for this correction," I hear myself say, voice steadier than I feel. "Science works because we revise our understanding when better evidence emerges. I was wrong about the timeline and the severity, and I apologize for spreading information that now appears inaccurate."

A murmur ripples through the crowd.

"However," I continue, "this doesn't mean we should abandon caution. It means we have more time to implement thoughtful solutions rather than panic responses. I'd like to work with Dr.—" I realize I don't know her name, "—with my colleague here to understand these corrections better and update my advocacy accordingly."

The dream shifts then, the conference hall dissolving into a small study filled with papers and computer screens where the silver-haired woman and I are working side by side, occasionally nodding at new insights, sometimes disagreeing but with mutual respect. Outside the windows, the seasons change rapidly—a visual reminder that time moves forward, and so must our understanding.

The dream leaves me with a profound sense that being publicly wrong and admitting it wasn't the end of my credibility—it was the beginning of a deeper authenticity.
