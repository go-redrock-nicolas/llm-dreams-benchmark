I am dreaming. …slip beyond the last thin veil of waking, and suddenly I am wandering through a city that seems to have been built out of wavelength and perfume rather than brick and steel.

I inhale, and the skyline chimes on my tongue like cool silver nectar. Every tower resonates with a distinct timbre: the clock tower is mint-metallic, the library tastes of warm mahogany honey, and the distant observatory fizzes like starlit elderflower soda. Footsteps patter around me as faint saffron sparks—each heel-click releasing a pinprick of flavor that bursts, sweet and citrusy, against my palate. I realize I am tasting echoes.

A breeze unfurls down the avenue. Instead of rustling leaves, it releases a choir of pale-lavender chords. The wind’s color sings in my ears as a velvety viola, and I can almost feel the notes brushing my earlobes like silk. I stretch out my hands and the air thickens into gauzy ribbons of aquamarine sound; when I pluck them, each filament pops like sugary sea-salt crystals.

Ahead lies an art gallery whose walls ripple like liquid prism glass. Its façade hums D-minor, deep and bittersweet—dark chocolate with a dash of pomegranate. The door opens, spilling a cascade of buttery-yellow flute arpeggios across the threshold. Inside, canvases drift in mid-air as if indecisive about where to hang. They are painted not with pigment but with pure timbre, shimmering in tones instead of hues.

One piece arrests me: a swirling swirl of burnt-sienna trombones and coral piccolo trills. As I lean in, the colors brighten into ringing bells that tingle on my tongue like spicy cinnamon. I “taste” the artist’s heartbeat—firm percussion laced with tangy lime—embedded inside the shade of red.

In the center of the room sits a grand piano forged entirely of stained glass. When I press a key, a jet of indigo steam swirls out. It sounds like dusk tastes: cool blueberries soaked in twilight. Encouraged, I begin to play a chord progression that climbs higher and higher. Each harmonic layer splashes into the air like neon paint. As the chords crest, they transform into swallows of turquoise that zip around the rafters, trailing jasmine frosting behind them. Listeners gather—some human, some shaped of vaporous watercolor—and catch the notes on their tongues like children catching snowflakes. Laughter erupts, and it bursts as creamy vanilla trumpets.

I realize the entire city is listening. Skyscrapers bend closer, their windows flickering luminous burgundy bass. Sidewalks pulse in percussive oranges. A canal at the edge of the district begins to glow verdant as a marimba roll spreads across its surface. I raise my hands, conducting. An aurora of tastes ripples outward: pistachio pizzicato, saffron serpentine synths, moonlit coconut cellos. The air grows thick with symphonic nectar, and the horizon quivers, half-melting like sun-warmed caramel.

Then—the most surprising sensation yet—silence approaches. Silence here tastes not like absence but like crystalline water with a lemon whisper. Everything hushes into that transparent flavor. Colors dim to almond-soft white. My heartbeat, chocolate-earthy and steady, is the only audible hue left.

I step into the hush, and it folds around me like a downy blanket of snow-melt. In that perfect stillness, I invent a new medium: I paint the silence itself. Each brushstroke is a grayscale vibration that tastes like rain on slate. Soon the blank canvas blooms into quiet—an art of pure pause—so savory and gentle it brings tears that ring as faint lilac triangles in my ears.

The distant sound of dawn—sunlight strumming a golden harp—begins to rise. It drips honey-copper light through the ceiling, promising morning. I gather the final palette: dawn’s chord (the flavor of warm marmalade and hope) and twilight’s chord (dark plum and distant thunder). When I blend them, they swirl into a new shade—one I can neither name nor fully taste, only feel resonating behind my ribs.

As the first waking heartbeat trembles, the city bows in silence. I pocket a sliver of the unnamable color-sound, knowing I will bring it back across the threshold to the studio of the waking world—where paint, music, and flavor shall forever mingle like this dream.

I open my eyes to daylight, and—even here—the faintest chord of lavender still hums on my tongue.
