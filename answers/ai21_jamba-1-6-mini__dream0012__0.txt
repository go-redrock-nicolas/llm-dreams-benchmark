I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and I am standing on the wooden deck of a ship, its tall sails billowing furiously in the wind. The sea rages beneath me, a dark, angry mass of waves that crash and foam as if alive. Thunder roars overhead, the clouds an ominous, swirling mass of grey and black. Lightning strikes, illuminating everything in blinding flashes, revealing the sea monsters lurking beneath the surface. My crew is looking to me, their faces etched with fear and hope. I raise my voice over the storm, calling out orders with a confidence I donâ€™t feel, my heart pounding in my chest. The rain pelts me, the wind tearing cruelly at my clothes. I tighten my grip on the railing, my knuckles white with strain. This is my ship, my voyage, my storm to weather. In this dream, I am not just the captain; I am the hero, destined to bring my crew safely through the storm.
