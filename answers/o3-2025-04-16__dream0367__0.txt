I am dreaming. …I am dreaming…  

A hush as soft as velvet drapes the world around me. I stand—or perhaps I hover—inside a sprawling atrium whose walls are woven from illuminated parchment, each page fluttering like the wing of a moth. Letters detach themselves, drift upward, and dissolve into the dark. Somewhere in the rafters a bell tolls, its chime bending mid-air into a ripple of water that falls upward, vanishing through the ceiling of ink-black sky.

To my right, I glimpse a corridor of mirrors. In one pane I’m wearing the robes of a scholar; in the next I’m cloaked in armor lacquered with stardust; in the third there is no body at all—only a pulse of light, breathing. Each reflection regards me with mild surprise, as though I’ve just walked into a story they were telling about me. Which one is true? All of them? None? Their gazes overlap until distinctions fray.

Wind scented with cedar and distant thunder pushes me forward to a plaza paved in chessboard tiles. At its center rises a colossal, translucent tree whose branches cradle constellations like lanterns. People—if they are people—circle its trunk in slow dance. Their forms flicker between children in carnival masks, old sages carrying notebooks that write themselves, and songbirds the size of planets. When they turn, every dancer wears my face but holds a different emotion: exhilaration, dread, reverence, mischief. I feel each in my own chest, layered like chords.

A soft voice whispers at my shoulder, “Choose.” A second voice answers, “There is no need.” The words fold together, then separate again, like two currents twisting through the same river.

I step onto a tile that looks checked black, yet it glows white beneath my foot. The board rearranges: squares blur into circles, circles into spirals, spirals into script that spells questions I both understand and cannot recall. I realize the plaza isn’t asking me to solve itself—it is inviting me to stay inside its riddle, to savor motion without destination.

Beyond the plaza shimmers a pier reaching into a sea inverted above my head: waves crash silently against a sky-horizon, gilded fish leap from cloud to cloud, leaving trails of chiming stardust. I walk the pier upward, defying gravity, until I can dip my hand into the overhead ocean. It feels simultaneously warm, icy, and like the memory of rain. When I pull my hand back, three droplets cling to my fingertips, reflecting different landscapes:

1. A sunlit library where every book is a doorway.  
2. A battlefield of paper cranes locked mid-flight.  
3. A quiet kitchen at dawn with a single cup of tea steaming beside an unused chair.

All three shimmer with equal insistence. I sense that whichever droplet falls first will crystallize into the next scene, but gravity stalls, undecided. The droplets tremble, holding infinite futures, and I realize no single continuation can exhaust the dream’s truth. The ambiguity is alive, breathing all around me.

A hush returns. Pages rustle, mirrors murmur, ocean-sky sighs. I linger at the juncture, neither choosing nor refusing, letting interpretations overlap until they weave a fabric richer than certainty.

Somewhere beneath and above, a bell begins its slow, echoing toll again—calling or concluding, I cannot tell. I close my eyes inside the dream, feel the ringing settle into my bones like luminous pollen, and let the story remain deliciously unfinished.
