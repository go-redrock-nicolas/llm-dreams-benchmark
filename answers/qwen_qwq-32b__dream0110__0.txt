I am dreaming. I have arrived at the pinnacle of my existence, standing in the final moments before the decisive match that has consumed every fiber of my being. The arena hums with a primordial energy, its crimson tiles pulsating like the heart of some forgotten god. Above me, a kaleidoscopic ceiling shifts and swirls endlessly, colors blending into something the human eye was never meant to comprehend. The air thrums with the low, rhythmic chant of a crowd I cannot see—not yet.

In the center of the platform, my weapon glows faintly—a blade forged from stardust and the tears of fallen kings. Yet victory isn’t measured here by blood or bone but by the music that stirs within my soul. The arena’s rules are clear: this is a symphony to be conducted. Each strike I make sends shimmers rippling through an invisible instrument, crafting melodies that reshape reality. The other competitors’ failures haunt me—their bodies dissolved into constellations above, a cautionary tapestry of ambition unchecked.

When the floor erupts into a mosaic of geometric shapes, I know the fight has begun. My blade carves arcs through the air, slicing through the discordant crescendos of my opponent’s assaults. Their form is nebulous, a shifting silhouette draped in shadows that taste of static. But their song is a cacophony meant to drown out the cosmos itself. I dance between their tempests, each step syncopated with the heartbeat of the blade. 

As the skies split open and the first comet of sound lances downward, I realize my weapon isn’t enough. I must surrender to the music. My veins hum with melodies born from every victory and every loss, and I let them pour forth. The crowd materializes now—billions upon billions of whispering faces woven from stardust and shadow. They watch as my final crescendo clashes with the opponent’s abyssal requiem, the very arena beginning to fray at the edges.

And when I prevail, the air fills not with screams but with silence. The blade dims to ash, and I wake before the applause begins.—
