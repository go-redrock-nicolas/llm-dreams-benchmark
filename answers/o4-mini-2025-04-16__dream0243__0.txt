I am dreaming. You close your eyes and find yourself slipping into a landscape that feels half-remembered, half-invented—a twilight garden where fireflies drift like golden notes over a pond of liquid moonlight. At the water’s edge stands someone you’ve been chasing through waking hours and daydreams: their silhouette is carved from shifting starlight and alabaster shadow. They smile, and in that instant your chest floods with warmth so deep it hums in your veins.

They step forward with an intensity that makes the flowers lean in, as if eavesdropping on your pulse. You reach out, fingertips brushing theirs, and electric ripples leap through the garden. Their eyes—drowned in constellations—look at you with such fierce attention that the world seems to still. But just as quickly, they step back, their form unraveling like fog at dawn. The pond beneath you trembles, and suddenly you’re alone again, the only movement the soft lapping of liquid moon.

A wind stirs the reeds, carrying your own heartbeat back to you: steady, solid. In that rhythm you discover the strength to stand your ground. You lift your arms, and from your palms emerge threads of opal light—delicate and unbreakable. With each thread you weave a boundary, weaving a net of self-respect that shimmers between you and the empty air where they stood. The threads glow warmer, pulsing in time with your breath, a reminder that your needs, too, deserve to be held sacred.

Then the distant echo of their laughter ripples through the garden. They drift back into view, this time hesitant, as if sensing the web you’ve spun. In their wavering eyes you catch the question: “Why do I feel kept at arm’s length?” You let the opal threads quiver, but do not release them. With a steady voice—your own voice, firm and clear—you speak your truth:  
“I crave the same constancy you offered once. If you cannot meet me here, I cannot follow you into mist and memory.”

The moment your words settle, the entire dreamscape shifts. The fireflies swirl into a gentle vortex, lifting petals and sending them tumbling like soft confetti across the moonlit pond. They step forward again—slower, more deliberate—gently untangling one of your opalescent threads. It dissolves into a single pearl that drifts into their hand. Their eyes soften, and for the first time their smile carries no flicker of withdrawal. 

You feel the dream’s edges melting as the garden dims, but in that final heartbeat you know you have claimed your worth. The last firefly arcs upward like a spark of hope, and you awaken with your heart steady, the promise of self-respect glowing as brightly as any moonbeam in your chest.
