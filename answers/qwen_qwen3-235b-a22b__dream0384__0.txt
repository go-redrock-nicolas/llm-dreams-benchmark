I am dreaming. Before me is not a landscape I recognize. It is not earth, and yet there are towering trees—trees that stretch like obsidian fingers into a sky stitched with pulsing auroras. Their leaves are mirrors. Each one reflects versions of *me* that I’ve never met: older, wiser, shadow-eyed and grinning with secrets; younger, curled like saplings in corners of memory; and others—strange distortions, twisted by fear or bloated with pride. The ground beneath my bare feet is soft, almost gelatinous, like walking through the collective dream of the world itself.

I know, without knowing, that all of this lies at the periphery of my awareness—a place I rarely visit in sleep. In waking life, I turn away from this stretch of self. Too real. Too raw. Too revealing.

There is a path. It bleeds forward in spirals, like the pattern of a fingerprint carved into the earth. Instinct says to follow it, though it makes my stomach twist.  

Then I see *them.* The challenges.  Not people, exactly—but manifestations. They rise ahead, not enemies, but *tests*. The first is a pool of smoke. If I walk through, I must let go of a long-held illusion. The second is a bird with wings like iron chains—if I let it land on my shoulder, I must endure the burden of truth when others would prefer lies. The third… the hardest of all… is a mirror-gate that burns like love and heartbreak combined. To step through is to confront the parts of myself I pretend don’t exist.

I stop. My heartbeat echoes louder than thunder in this place.

I *want* to avoid the path. I find reasons suddenly bursting to life like weeds in my mind—excuses dressed as logic, warnings passing themselves off as wisdom. “Wait,” I think. “This is too much. It’s not the right time.” The comfort of a placeless void begins to form. It offers none of the beauty, none of the terror. Just silence.

But a voice, gentle and sure, rises from the pit of my chest.

*"Discomfort is the friction that bends growth into shape.”*

So I close my eyes. The air shifts around me. The mirror-gate hums in anticipation.

One long breath. Then another. The kind that makes time itself pause.

And I move forward.

The moment I cross the threshold, the dream fractures—not into pieces, but into *possibilities*. The version I've been avoiding all my life rises like a dawn from the center of everything. Not perfect. Not fearless. But *real*. Terribly, beautifully, defiantly real.

And as the dream deepens, I don’t awaken.  

For the first time, I stay.  
And I *grow.*
