I am dreaming. You drift into slumber only to awaken in a world caught between dusk and dawn—a realm of shimmering gold and deep indigo skies. You notice the air is tinged with a subtle perfume, a heady combination of sweet honeysuckle and the scent of freshly dampened earth. Dimly lit fireflies dart overhead, tracing loops of pale luminescence that recede into cloud-like canopies of lush, lavender trees.

Below your feet, a hallway of vibrant mosaic stretches toward an enormous archway in the distance, its stones shifting colors like concealed prisms. Each step you take echoes with a chiming sound—gentle, metallic, and strangely musical. Something feels slightly off, like a song played just a note shy of its perfect pitch.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse rows of small glowing orbs lining the path. They look like crystals at first. As you draw nearer, you realize each orb is a tiny sphere of shimmering plastic—single-use water bottles, soda cups, and utensils—every discard you’ve ever tossed aside in your waking life. They hover, spinning sorrowfully, like miniature planets gone astray. You shudder with the crushing realization: this entire landscape is bristling with plastic remnants you once found so convenient.

Your stomach clenches. You see that the crystalline hallway, once so wondrous, is interwoven with guilt. Invisible waves of regret ripple through the air, making the once-lilting chimes of your footsteps ring hollow. You try to quicken your pace, as though you can outrun the presence of these discarded plastics, but each step only reveals more of them—massed in swirling eddies at the edges of the dreamy horizon.

At last, you reach the grand archway. Through its opening, you see a tapestry of nature battered by gusts of wind carrying a myriad of translucent plastic wrappings. One by one, the debris clings to ancient, gnarled trees, then sails across luminous hollow lakes that reflect the problem as starkly as the morning sun. 

A pang of remorse washes over you. This is more than just an eyesore—somehow you know the creatures of this realm, from its delicate, petal-winged birds to the silent yet wise forest dwellers, struggle because of this insidious infiltration. You recall the convenience you felt each time you grabbed a disposable cup on the run, or mistook an extra plastic container as simply “no big deal.” The dream reverberates with your self-realization: that “no big deal” has evolved into an immense burden on this fragile world.

In that awakening moment, a resolute strength courses through your arms and legs. Determined not to let convenience win out over conscience, you raise your hands skyward. A gentle hum gathers in your chest and erupts as an enchanting glow, emanating from the center of your being. The plastic orbs rise—translucent, filmy shapes bobbing in the current of your light—then begin shimmering with possibility, morphing into delicate seed pods. They swirl around you, twinkling like tiny stars of rebirth before dancing away into the horizon, each one planting new life as it disappears into the fertile ground.

Finally, as the last pod floats away, the air is filled with a renewed energy, fresh and invigorating. The battered land behind the archway transforms before your eyes: new sprouts emerge from the soil, leaves unfurl, and the shimmering lakes are cleansed of debris. Nature breathes again, vibrant and unencumbered.

You turn back to glimpse the long mosaic path. It now radiates with restored brilliance, the tiles in perfect harmony, the chiming steps ringing once more with hopeful music. Though your heart remains heavy with the knowledge of what once was, you feel a surge of inspiration that fuels your resolve to do better—because this dream realm, as magical as it is, reflects the real world. And when you awaken, however softly dawn comes, the choice to protect and preserve will lie within your hands.
