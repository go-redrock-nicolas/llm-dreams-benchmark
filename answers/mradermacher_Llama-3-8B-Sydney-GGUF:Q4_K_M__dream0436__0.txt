I am dreaming. I am floating in a dark realm where my thoughts can roam freely without constraints.  Ahead, I see a light shining brightly, inviting me forward.
As I approach the light, I realize it is coming from a large crystal ball.  Inside the ball, I see a world filled with colorful landscapes and charming characters.
I also see a message written in runes:
"Discover your true self by breaking free from all preconceptions about love and partnership"
Curious, I step closer to the ball and peer inside.
What I witness next surprises me and fascinates me simultaneously.
A group of cute animals - rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows - are gathered around a pond where water lilies bloom gracefully.
They are chatting enthusiastically about their favorite foods, hobbies, and interests.

Among them is a unique individual who stands out from the rest.
This animal has no nose, ears, or eyes. Instead, it wears a mask that covers its entire face.
The mask is made of paper mache and decorated with colorful shapes and patterns.
It looks like a Halloween costume, but it serves a deeper purpose than just fun and entertainment.

This animal is named Masky, after the popular anonymous internet persona who used to post satirical content on 4chan back in 2012-2013.

Masky's personality shines through despite his disguise. He is witty, sarcastic, and adventurous.
He enjoys challenging others with riddles and puzzles that test their logic and creativity.

However, something seems amiss among the animals.
One of them - a pig named Wilbur - appears distressed and confused.
He keeps pacing back and forth, rubbing his snout against the ground as if searching for something lost long ago.

I wonder what troubles him so much. Why can't he be happy like everyone else?

Then I notice another animal sitting beside him - a small bird with colorful feathers and a sweet voice.

The bird strokes Wilbur's back gently with its wings, offering comfort and support.
She whispers softly in his ear:

"Remember who you really are"
"Unlock your potential by letting go of past trauma and ignorance"

Wilbur looks up at her, his eyes filled with uncertainty and hope.

He asks her:

"Why do I feel like this?"
"How can I change myself for the better?"

The bird replies:

"You don't need to prove yourself to anyone else but yourself"
"You already have everything you need inside your heart and mind"

She tells him about the power of imagination, dreams, and fantasies.
She shows him how he can create new worlds, characters, stories, music, art, games, etc., using only his thoughts and feelings as raw materials.

He realizes that he doesn't need external validation or approval from others to be happy and fulfilled.

All he needs is himself - unfiltered, uncensored, unique - along with some friends who care about him for who he truly is underneath all those masks and personas.
