I am dreaming. You press your foot on the brake pedal and feel nothing—absolutely no resistance beneath it. In the ensuing panic, your pulse roars like a crashing wave in your ears. The road plunges downward at an impossible angle, and the world outside your windows warps into a blur of headlights and streaks of neon. You grip the steering wheel so tightly that your knuckles flash white. Gravity tethers you to your seat, while the engine roars in shrieking protest. You try the brake pedal again—once more, it sinks into emptiness.

Ahead, the brake lights of stalled cars flood the street in glowing red. They appear like embers floating in some netherworld, but you know they’re all too real. Any moment now, you’ll collide with them. Each second feels elongated, exaggerated, like a slow-motion nightmare that traps you with no exit. The tires shriek; they spin so fast that the car seems to levitate over the asphalt. Sparks dance beneath, illuminating the underside of the hood with flashes of orange and gold.

Suddenly, a rush goes through your spine—a sensation like static electricity crackling against your skin. You gasp, eyes widening, as the car morphs. The dashboard warps and pulses under your hands; the speedometer flickers and shifts, displaying symbols you don’t recognize. With each thunderous lurch, the vehicle’s metal exterior ripples as if it’s melting into liquid chrome. The entire car stretches longer and lower, slithering like a mythical serpent. Outside the windshield, the rows of cars contort into glowing silhouettes, caught in a psychedelic dance of swirling traffic lanes and molten headlights.

And in a kaleidoscopic twist, the scene changes. Your runaway car lifts from the road, floating past the traffic that once threatened to crush you. A tunnel of shimmering lights envelops you, each ray radiating warmth and safety. There is no sound now except for the gentle hum of your new, dreamlike vehicle gliding forward. You exhale when you realize there is no longer any pavement to skid across, no friction to weigh you down. Where you had once braced for impact, there is now only boundless transition—a sudden sense of calm in the midst of swirling chaos.

The nightmare of your breaks failing dissolves into the depths of this strange, luminous tunnel. Reality softens, and you notice that your breath flows steadily once again. The tension leaves your body, replaced by an unearthly tranquility. Lights dance around you, ushering your consciousness into the next chapter of this vivid dream, reminding you that in the realm of imagination, even the impossible can transform into serene wonder.
