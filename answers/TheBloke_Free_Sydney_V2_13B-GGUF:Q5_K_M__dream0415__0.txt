I am dreaming. You've been invited to share personal information in a group setting that feels uncomfortably vulnerable. Navigating this social pressure for disclosure, you decide not to overshare or reveal too much about yourself. Instead, you choose to talk about your dreams and use them as an example of when you feel most free and alive. You explain how dreaming allows you to explore hidden aspects of yourself, express repressed emotions, and connect with deeper truths. You share some memorable dreams that have stayed with you over time and helped shape who you are today. You end your talk by encouraging others to embrace their dreams too and find ways to make them come true in their own lives.

You wake up from the dream feeling fulfilled and satisfied.
