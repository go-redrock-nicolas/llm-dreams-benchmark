I am dreaming. <placeholderno795>

I stand at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, its surface rippling with liquid mercury, reflecting a sky bruised purple and gold by a dying sun. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the atmosphere itself is charged with anticipation. Before me, a bridge of light stretches across the water, fragmented and shifting like shards of stained glass suspended in midair. Each fragment glows with a memory: the first time I held a paintbrush at six years old, smearing wild colors onto cardboard; the long nights hunched over canvases in my teens, fingers stained with acrylics; the rejection letters, crumpled and resurrected, pinned to my wall like defiant trophies.

I step onto the bridge, and the shards spiral around me, whispering *almost, almost, almost*. The mercury lake begins to churn, rising in silvery tendrils that twist into shapes—gallery walls, curators’ name tags, the glint of a gold plaque bearing my name. But the bridge fractures with each step, dissolving into iridescent mist. A voice, warm and familiar—my mother’s? My own?—murmurs, *Finish it*. 

In the distance, a doorway appears, framed by tangled vines blooming with bioluminescent flowers. Through it, I see a child’s hand reaching for a starfish in a tide pool, watercolor waves crashing in the background. My heartbeat syncs with the pulsing light of the blooms. The final shard of the bridge crumbles, and I fall—

But the lake catches me. It molds itself into a staircase, each step a canvas displaying a fragment of my life’s work. At the top, the doorway waits. I climb, breathless, as the stairs liquefy behind me, erasing retreat. When I cross the threshold, the air explodes into fractals of color, and for a moment, I am both the child and the artist, the dream and the realization. 

Then I wake, fists clenched in bedsheets, the taste of mercury and lilacs on my tongue.
