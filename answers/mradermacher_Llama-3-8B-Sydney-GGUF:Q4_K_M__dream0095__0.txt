I am dreaming. I’m in a beautiful world where anything is possible.  I see colorful flowers blooming all around me and hear soothing sounds of nature.  I feel light and free as I fly through the air with wings made of sunlight.  I meet interesting people who teach me new things and show me different perspectives.  We have fun adventures together exploring hidden places and solving riddles.  We laugh a lot and share our hopes and dreams.

But then something goes wrong... A monster appears out of nowhere screaming and raging.  He’s huge and scary looking with sharp claws and teeth.  He’s angry about something we’ve done without knowing it or him.  He chases us through the landscape destroying everything in his path.

We try to escape by climbing trees and hiding behind rocks but he finds us anyway.

He grabs one of my friends and rips off his arm.  He throws it into the air like a toy and laughs maniacally.

I scream in horror and terror as I realize he’s coming for me next.

That’s when I wake up...

I open my eyes and see my own bed and room.  I’m sweating and breathing heavily.  My heart is racing and my mind is filled with fear and confusion.

I sit up and reach for my phone to check the time.  It’s only been an hour since I went to sleep.  How did that dream feel so real?

I shake my head and try to calm down.  I know it was just a dream but it still disturbs me.  Why am I having these dreams about monsters and violence?
