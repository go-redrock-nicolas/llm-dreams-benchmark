I am dreaming. …open your eyes in a place that does not exist.

You are standing on an endless marble wharf the color of moon-milk, one foot planted in waking life, the other in dream.  A single invitation flutters in your hand.  Its parchment is warm the way a pocket-kept stone is warm, and when you tilt it toward the water the ink rearranges itself into whispering sentences:

“Your presence is requested at a gathering of every heartbeat you have ever skipped.”

Instantly a chill scurries across your shoulders.  You recognize the phrase—social event, people, unpredictable laughter—and the familiar tremor of anticipatory dread shivers up your spine.  Normally you know these evenings end well, yet the pre-party hours feel like balancing on the rim of a teacup seven stories above the ground.  

So, in the merciful logic of dreams, you decide to investigate the anxiety itself.

1. Descent into the Archival Theater  
You step from the wharf onto a staircase spiraling downward, carved from stacked ticket stubs and receipt paper.  Each tread releases the scent of old perfume, after-rain concrete, and tapping keyboard keys.  These are the smells of past gatherings, memories pressed flat between pages of time.  The farther down you travel, the louder you hear a low murmur: overlapping voices rehearsing greetings, jokes, clever retorts that were never spoken.

At the bottom you find a grand theater built entirely from tilted photo frames.  Row upon row of empty velvet seats face a stage wrapped in red lânoan velvet (a fabric that exists only when no one doubts it).  The lights dim.  The curtain rises.  

2. The Pageant of Possible Mishaps  
Onto the stage march cardboard cutouts of “What Could Go Wrong.”  They wear masks painted with exaggerated sneers and raised eyebrows.  They trip, spill drinks, pronounce names incorrectly.  A spotlight highlights every stumble, every blush.  The orchestra—a pit of clocks—ticks a rhythm so fast your pulse tries to keep up.

But you notice something curious: the cutouts have jointed limbs held together with flimsy brads.  One stiff breeze would knock the whole pageant flat.  Their menace is only theater, but your body has forgotten.  It remains tense, rehearsing escape routes.

3. Opening the Balcony Door  
A door appears beside the stage, labeled with your childhood nickname.  You climb to it and push it open.  Behind it is a small attic lit by fairy lights.  Sitting on an oversized luggage trunk is a much younger version of you—perhaps seven, perhaps nine—wearing an ill-fitting party hat and hugging knees close to chest.

You: “Why are we hiding up here?”  
Child-You: “Because downstairs they might laugh at the way we say hello.”  
You, crouching: “But they usually end up laughing with us.”  
Child-You, mulling this over, produces a crumpled index card: “List of Potential Embarrassments.”  Forty-six bullet points.  Many are endearingly improbable: “Trip on invisible fish,” “Suddenly forget vowels,” “Accidentally reveal we are a Martian spy.”

You gently smooth the card, fold it into a paper crane, and blow on it.  It flutters out the attic window into a night sky that looks like spilled sequins.

4. The Corridor of Rehearsed Futures  
Rejoined by your younger self—whose hand fits perfectly into yours—you walk a corridor lined with mirrored doors.  Each door flashes a different future:  

• Door of Awkward Silence: Everyone crowds into tiny conversational cliques, leaving you adrift.  
• Door of Inescapable Spotlight: A toast is thrust upon you before your tongue feels ready.  
• Door of Effortless Delight: Music swells, conversation bounces, you glow.

You pass these doors, neither choosing nor rejecting them, merely noticing.  The anxiety pulses in your palm like a small bird’s heart, but it doesn’t strangle your throat anymore; it simply exists, acknowledged.

5. Breaching the Ballroom  
Finally you reach a set of cathedral doors woven from vines of silver ivy.  They part not with a creak but a sigh: the sound of exhaled tension.  Inside is the gathering—only, it isn’t people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in stale air.  It’s an orchard beneath a velvet-indigo sky, each tree hung with glowing lantern fruit.  Guests drift between trunks like constellations that learned to waltz.  When they speak, their words form fireflies that hover for a beat, then vanish.

A host—neither man nor woman but something warmly human—greets you with a nod that says, “You are neither too early nor too late.”  They hand you a flute of starlight-sparkling water.  The first sip is cool reassurance.

Your younger self gives your hand a final squeeze, then dissolves into a swirl of fragrant petals, scattering among the guests like confetti of courage.  You feel the absence, but also the gift:  an unknotted ribbon in your chest where the tightness used to be.

6. The Dance of Actual Moments  
Music begins, composed entirely of present tense: the hush of wind through leaves, the low laugh two rows over, the crisp bite of apple a stranger has just taken.  It’s imperfect, glorious, alive.  You step onto the grass-soft dance floor.  Are your palms sweaty?  Yes.  Does someone bump your elbow?  Absolutely.  But each “flaw” is a note in the symphony of real experience, and you find it oddly melodious.

A fellow guest asks, “Care to dance?”  
You answer—not with a rehearsed line, but with the simplest truth: “I’d like that.”  Your feet remember how enjoyment sneaks up on you once you stop orchestrating every outcome.  Anxiety lingers at the orchard’s edge, but it looks smaller now, and vaguely theatrical, like discarded scenery.

7. Waking with a Souvenir  
The dream begins to thin, dawn filtering through like watercolor.  Before it fades, the host presses something into your palm: a glowworm of soft jade light.  

“It is the knowledge that anticipation is only one future disguised as certainty,” they say.  “Carry it lightly.  It will shrink in daylight, but it never fully dies.”

You wake, still hearing distant orchard music—half memory, half heartbeat.  Your hand is empty, yet you sense a calming weight near your wrist, an after-echo of jade light: reassurance that tonight, or any night, the party may start awkwardly, may bloom gloriously, but will always be just another room you are capable of entering.

And so you inhale, exhale, and rise—invitation accepted.
