I am dreaming. —yet, just as I begin to feel the fleeting comfort of the strategies I've so carefully gathered—a quiet room, a soothing mantra, the steady draw and release of my own breath—a sudden, invisible pressure materializes. It’s like a crack of thunder in a clear sky, as if the air thickens with electricity and my surroundings shift. The boundaries between my thoughts and the world around me blur.

The room grows larger and smaller at once; walls breathe, changing color with my every heartbeat, pulsing in shades of stormcloud gray and fever-bright blue. My hands, once steady, start to shimmer, as though made of soft light that leaks between my fingers. The crisis arrives with a tangible presence: a torrent of water crashing through the locked door, carrying with it every anxious memory and regret I have ever known.

I feel my chest tighten, the familiar techniques buckling against the weight of this compounded burden. Yet, somewhere deeper, further down than fear or tension, I find a strange spark of curiosity. I stand, water swirling around my ankles—the chill of it sharp and awakening. The walls, instead of caving in, reshape into enormous paper cranes, their wings flapping and scattering droplets like gemstones in the moonlight.

My breath, ragged but rhythmic, sends ripples across the floor. I remember that I am not just a victim of the flood, but its observer and its dreamer. I start to move, not running from the water, but wading into its depths, letting its icy presence remind me that I am alive, that I am dreaming. My strategies morph into something else—they become colors I paint on the walls, bridges I build from memories of laughter, shields I forge from quiet determination.

Each additional wave threatens to knock me down, but I grow roots—luminous and green—anchoring myself to the floor, drawing strength from the deepest soil of my imagination. I stretch my arms wide and welcome the chaos, bearing the downpour with the wisdom of trees weathering countless storms.

After what feels like an eternity, the water subsides, leaving the room transformed—lush with wildflowers that bloom in the wake of every crisis faced. I catch my reflection in a sudden, clear puddle: I am both older and younger, scarred and shining. The crisis lingers, but it no longer owns me; I stand, dream-bound and radiant, knowing I have survived, forged something beautiful from the wild flood of it all.
