I am dreaming. In a vast marble auditorium filled with rippling shadows and shimmering light, I watch from the back row as someone else walks confidently across a stage draped in deep burgundy velvet. The spotlights follow their every move, creating a golden halo around their form while I remain hidden in darkness. The air feels thick with unspoken words, like fog rolling in from the sea.

They're receiving an ornate crystal award, its facets catching and scattering light like a thousand tiny stars. The award is for a project I know intimately - every late night, every breakthrough, every moment of inspiration lives in my bones. I can trace my fingerprints across its foundations, yet here I sit, invisible among the applauding crowd.

My chest tightens with a complex cocktail of emotions: pride for the project's success mingles with a sharp sting of betrayal. Bitterness rises like bile in my throat, but it's tempered by waves of guilt for feeling this way at all. Should I not be bigger than this? More gracious? The rational part of my mind wrestles with the wounded ego, creating a dizzying internal dialogue.

As they deliver their acceptance speech, their words echo strangely in the dream-space, distorting and transforming. Sometimes they seem to be speaking underwater, other times their voice booms like thunder. Not once do they mention my name, yet occasionally they turn to look directly at me, their eyes simultaneously apologetic and challenging.

The crowd begins to morph around me - their faces become mirrors, each reflecting back my own expression of contained turmoil. The ceiling seems to rise higher and higher, stretching into infinite darkness while the stage grows more distant, though the sound of applause grows deafening. I feel myself becoming lighter, less substantial, as if my contribution to the project is somehow tied to my very existence.

The dream pulses with questions about validation, recognition, and the nature of collaboration. What does it mean to share credit? Where does one person's work end and another's begin? The answers swirl just out of reach, like autumn leaves caught in a whirlwind.

The scene begins to dissolve at the edges, bleeding into watercolor swirls of emotion and memory, leaving me suspended between pride in the work itself and the human desire to be acknowledged for it.
