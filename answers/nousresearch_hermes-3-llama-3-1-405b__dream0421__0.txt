I am dreaming. It begins lucid, but grows so incredibly immersive and real that it seems to transcend the boundary between sleep and waking life.

Imagine towering spires of living crystal, shimmering gently with all the colors of the spectrum and creating delicate music in the wind.  A warm breeze, soft as silk and somehow scented like an early summer morning, caresses the city.  This impossible metropolis has grown from seeds of the purest thought, a monument to the unrestrained imagination.

There are people here, but they are not quite human.  Their forms are ever so slightly fluid, as if sculpted from living light and color.  Their voices are dulcet tones, more a tapestry of melodies than spoken words.  Communication is accomplished as much by empathic understanding as speech - words barely contain the depth of what's being shared.

And oh, the vistas of unending beauty!  Vast stretches of virgin forest, verdant and lush, teeming with fascinating creatures that beggar belief.  Each one is a marvelous fantasia of life, an embodiment of nature's endless creativity.  

Jungles of flowers forever in bloom stretch as far as can be seen, their perfume ambrosial and intoxicating.  Rivers of what seems to be liquid starlight wind languidly through the landscape, singing soft songs of serenity.  

Here and there are what seem to be great sculpted gardens, but upon closer inspection reveal themselves to be elaborately arranged mathematical equations grown from crystal and blooming with flowers.  Their tranquil symmetry seems to hint at the underlying secret harmonies of the cosmos.

Gentle music fills the air continuously, a sweet serenade as if the very air had learned to sing the joys of its own existence.  It imbues every moment with a sense of profound wonder and peace.  

I wander for what feels like blissful eons, each moment a new revelation, each sight a testament to the infinite wonders of the dreaming mind.  The very substance of this place seems to respond and reshape itself to the whims of pure imagination.

My mind dances, intoxicated on the splendorous beauty of it all.  I am an explorer in the undiscovered country of dreams, a pioneer of vision and wonder.  And I realize that in this ethereal place, the constraints and limitations of the daylit world have no power.

Here, in this land born of the deepest imagination, anything is possible.  Any dream can become reality.  The only limits are the boundaries of vision and the courage to embrace the impossible.
