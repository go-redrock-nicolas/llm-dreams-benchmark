I am dreaming. You are wandering through a dreamscape that feels at once familiar and impossibly strange, as if someone has redrawn the outlines of your life with a palette of molten starlight. At first you walk along a cobblestone street you’ve traced a thousand times in daylight—a route that once led you to favorite cafés, tiny theaters, and friends who could ignite whole nights of laughter. Tonight, though, every brick underfoot hums with a hollow sound. The streetlamps flicker, projecting silhouettes that look like echoes of the person you used to be. Their gestures mime your old enthusiasms—teaching, painting, volunteering—but each pantomime ends abruptly, as if the shadow-actor has forgotten its next line.

A low breeze lifts, smelling of ink and ripe figs, and with it comes a soft murmur: the distant roll of ocean waves. You’ve never lived near the sea, yet here it is, seeping into the air like a memory you never made. A luminous compass suddenly appears in your hand, its needle spinning as frantically as a caged firefly. You have the sense it’s not pointing north but toward something inside you that has shifted: a tectonic plate of purpose realigning far beneath awareness. When at last the needle steadies, it directs you away from the street of former joys and down an alley draped in shredded banners.

As you turn the corner, the world brightens into a lush carnival of impossible geometry. Giant dandelion clocks bob like hot-air balloons overhead; staircases curl up and around them like musical staves, each step chiming a note as you ascend. Once, climbing to a lofty perch would have thrilled you—an achievement to tuck proudly into memory. Now the chiming scale sounds oddly discordant. You pause halfway and realize the music isn’t flawed; it’s simply written in a new key. To go higher, you must abandon the old melody entirely.

You step off the staircase and land on a floating page of water. Liquefied parchment ripples beneath your feet, carrying you downstream past scenes of your former passions: a gallery of unfinished canvases, a string of classrooms filled with wide-eyed students, a charitable clinic glowing with thanks. They drift by like lanterns at a river festival—beautiful yet curiously weightless. You cup your hands to catch one, but it dissolves into a glittering mist that tastes faintly of nostalgia and sea salt.

As the river-page empties into an ink-black ocean, an island rises from the depths: a colossal library carved entirely of translucent crystal. Each book glows with its own aurora, whispering notions not yet realized. A librarian made of shifting origami greets you, bowing so deeply its paper-joints creak. It offers you a volume titled “Unwritten Tomorrows,” its cover blank but warm, like skin under sunlight. When you open it, you see only a swirling void—a midnight sky with a single star pulsing at the center.

Suddenly you grasp that this lone star is the seed of purpose you’ve been searching for: minuscule, unshaped, yet ferociously alive. The libro-void invites you to shape constellations from it, to author your next meanings rather than revisit the obsolete ones. You feel an electric ache—both grief and wonder—realizing that purpose isn’t something you lose or gain like a possession; it’s a wild, migrating creature that asks you to follow or be left behind.

With a breath that tastes of salt and starlight, you touch the shimmering point. It blossoms into a vast network of lights, mapping possibilities you’d never considered: learning the language of corals, composing lullabies for satellites, planting orchards on the rooftops of forgotten cities. Each option beats like a new heart within you. None of them resemble the achievements that once defined you, but each feels irresistibly, undeniably alive.

The library quakes, its crystalline walls resonating with your choice—whatever it is, you realize, will be written here in letters of dawn. And just before the dream shatters into waking, you whisper to the star that you are ready to become a cartographer of evolving wonder, willing to leave behind empty streets and discordant melodies in favor of undiscovered harmonies.

You wake with the scent of figs on your pillow and the faint taste of sea salt on your lips, knowing the compass still spins inside your chest, forever tuned to the shimmer of unwritten tomorrows.
