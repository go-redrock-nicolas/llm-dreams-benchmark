I am dreaming.

The air shimmers with the coppery scent of incense and pulsing drumbeats as I step barefoot into an ancient circle of stone, cut deep in the heart of a forest older than memory. Moonlight pours down like silver rain, dappling the faces of robed figures swaying rhythmically beside me. The ceremony--whispered about only in half-truths in my waking life--unfolds with a gravity and beauty that tugs at something hidden within me.

A gentle voice bids me kneel before an altar draped in indigo cloth and threaded with gold. Strange symbols, painted in ochre and verdigris, spiral along the edge—glyphs I cannot read but feel thrumming just beneath my skin, as if they are stories I once knew. A priestess, her hair woven with wildflowers and bones, presses a cold chalice into my hands. The liquid within glows faintly, verdant and thick, smelling of moss and honey and the promise of secrets long guarded.

I drink. The world blurs, sways. My heart beats in time with the drumming, and I sense the forest breathe around me—a sentient, ancient presence. I watch as my perceptions shift, colors blooming more vivid than any waking palette. The chanting becomes a river of sound, syllables threading through the gaps of my understanding, inviting and mysterious.

Hands—kind, calloused—guide me to stand and weave patterns in the air. I mimic movements older than language, and as I do, I feel layers of weariness falling away. My feet tingle, rooted.

In that moment, I am both guest and participant, a vessel filled with the rippling sensation that all things are connected—the moon, the stones, the songs, the salt on my tongue from the ceremonial bread. I do not understand every gesture or word, but the intention washes through me: reverence for the earth, gratitude for breath, wonder at the unknown.

When the ceremony ends, dawn is staining the sky, and I leave the circle aglow with a fragile, gossamer sense of belonging—to something greater, mysterious, and heartbreakingly beautiful. No longer fully an outsider, I carry the echo of this night back into the waking world.
