I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a forest bathed in silver moonlight. Each tree trunk is carved with tiny runes that glow like the pulse of an ancient heart. A soft wind stirs the leaves, and as it brushes past, you realize your skin feels strangely electric—alive with possibility. In the distance, shapes drift between the trees, ambiguous silhouettes that tug at your mind with half–formed stories of danger.  

A tingle of unease seeps in: you sense you’re filling those shadows with your own doubts, imagining fangs or clawed hands where none exist. You pause, take a slow breath of the cool, fragrant air, and decide to question that first, dark impulse. You whisper to yourself, “What if this is not a threat but an invitation?” The moment you frame it as curiosity instead of fear, the woods hush.  

A single firefly, luminous and gentle, flutters forward and alights on your outstretched hand. Its light swirls into a tiny constellation that drifts upward, revealing the true shapes in the shadows—delicate, winged creatures no bigger than your palm, their eyes reflecting starlight. Rather than recoil, you smile. You realize your mind’s habit of leaping to the worst possible explanation can be rewired. You imagine these beings as guides, not predators.  

As you let go of pessimistic assumptions, the entire forest responds. Moss underfoot blossoms into a living carpet of bioluminescent flowers, each bloom humming softly in chromatic harmony. The air fills with a gentle melody, as if the trees themselves are singing lullabies of encouragement. You step onto a path of glowing stones that rearrange themselves to spell words of kindness and possibility: “Trust,” “Imagine,” “Create.”  

The path leads you to a clearing where a pool of liquid mirror rests, reflecting not your face but a kaleidoscope of your potential selves—an inventor with glowing goggles, a dancer woven from light, a storyteller whose words sprout wings. You reach out, and ripples carry the images into your heart. You realize that by catching yourself at the brink of a negative assumption, you’ve sparked a transformation in this dreamscape—and within yourself.  

With every step back toward the forest’s edge, you carry that newfound curiosity. The winged creatures trail behind you, flickering like living lanterns, and the runes in the trees shine brighter as if saluting your discovery. You wake with the echo of their song still humming in your veins, knowing that in both dream and daylight you can choose wonder over worry.
