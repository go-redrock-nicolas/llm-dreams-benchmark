I am dreaming. —rift through the clouds of my consciousness, suspended between waking thought and wild invention. Colors swirl—unnaturally luminous, vibrant beyond description—forming waves that rise and crest and dissolve into infinite patterns, each one a flickering vision.

In this dream-scape, I am floating in a cathedral made of kaleidoscopic light and shifting geometry. Here, music takes visible shape: notes glimmer and spiral upwards as translucent ribbons, wrapping around clusters of glowing words. Sentences, unfinished, hang in the air like constellations, waiting for my imagination to connect the dots and draw out new worlds.

Ideas pour from my mind in torrents: scenes of lush forests whose trees are hung with shimmering lanterns; cities built on the backs of enormous, gentle whales drifting through an aquamarine sky; conversations with long-extinct creatures who spin riddles and laughter like silk from their tongues. Every image arrives whole, surrounded by a web of sensation—smells of sweet rain on ancient stone, the velvet hush of midnight, the tang of ozone in the air.

I sketch with starlight, my hands moving of their own accord, painting stories across the sky that pulse with possibility. Time evaporates—everything happens all at once, yet stretches into eternity. I converse with wise mentors conjured from memory and myth, their eyes glowing with secret knowledge as they guide my thoughts onto twisting, golden paths.

There is a sense of endlessness, of limitless creation. Here, I am both the dreamer and the architect of dreams. The world expands with each breath, each idea, each surge of wonder—until I am lost and found in a universe crafted entirely from inspiration, where the boundaries of what is possible become blurred, and every imagined thing shimmers with the promise of becoming real.
