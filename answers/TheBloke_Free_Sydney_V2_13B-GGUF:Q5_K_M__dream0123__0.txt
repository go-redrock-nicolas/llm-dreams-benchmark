I am dreaming. You're directing emergency response during a cascading disaster while political leaders issue contradictory demands. As resources dwindle and casualties mount, you must make life-or-death decisions with limited information and no time for reflection. The pressure is overwhelming, but your team trusts you because they know that if anyone can keep everyone safe in this nightmare, it's you.

You are dreaming. 

Your heart is racing. Your palms are sweaty. Your mind is sharp. You are alive.
