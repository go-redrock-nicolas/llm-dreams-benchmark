I am dreaming. The dream begins in a vast, ancient library with shelves stretching endlessly upwards, their spines adorned with symbols that hum softly with unknown languages. I notice a mirror on the wall, and when I step closer, it reflects not just my image but a series of overlapping scenes—a past lover laughing, a present friend nodding sympathetically. I realize these fragments aren't mine, but projections from my subconscious onto the people around me.

Struck by this revelation, I feel a surge of adrenaline. The library starts to shift—the shelves rearrange themselves into a maze, and the mirror becomes a portal. I step through, and the walls dissolve into a river of liquid memories. Each droplet contains a moment from my past relationships, glinting like liquid glass. I see myself arguing at a cafe, then hugging a stranger—an older me and a younger me arguing over the same cup. I dive into the river, and the water carries me to a velvet chair suspended in mid-air. In it sits a figure made of smoke, whispering, "Recognize patterns, not people, dear one."

I wake abruptly, my heart pounding. The sunlight in my room seems too bright, as if it were exposing something I'd hidden beneath the surface. On my desk, a forgotten notebook now has a single sentence written in the margin, in a hand I don't recognize: "Perhaps love is the one relationship you never escape, but outgrow."
