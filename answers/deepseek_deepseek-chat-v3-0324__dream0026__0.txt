I am dreaming. The air in the vast, echoing hall is thick with the scent of aged wood and the faint metallic tang of stage lights burning overhead. The floor beneath me hums with a silent energy, as if the polished boards remember every performance that has ever graced them.  

I step forward, my palms slick with sweat, my breath shallow. The judges loom in the shadows just beyond the reach of the footlights—tall, faceless figures draped in flowing robes like sentinels of some ancient order. Their presence feels like time itself is holding its breath.  

This is it. The moment I've rehearsed for, the one I've lost sleep over, the one that has played out a thousand times in my mind. My fingers twitch, muscles coiled, heart pounding like a drum against my ribs.  

Then—I begin.  

The world sharpens into perfect stillness. Every movement, every breath, becomes part of an unfolding spell. My body moves without thought, guided by an instinct honed through years of relentless practice. The air itself seems to ripple in my wake, shimmering like heat distortion over desert sands.  

Yet… something is *wrong*.  

A whisper curls at the edges of my perception—not words, but a sound like dry leaves skittering across stone. The judges lean forward in unison, their faceless gazes piercing. My flawless execution wavers for the first time. A single misstep. A hesitation.  

The floor beneath my feet **changes**. The smooth wood splinters into something uneven, shifting like a living thing. Shadows stretch long fingers toward me. The air grows heavier, suffocating, pressing down until my chest burns.  

Then—laughter. Soft at first, then rising in a chorus of hollow, echoing mirth. The judges dissolve into swirling smoke. The hall stretches into an endless corridor of distorted mirrors, each reflection showing me a different version of myself—broken, triumphant, screaming.  

I wake with a gasp, the taste of copper on my tongue, my sheets tangled around me. For a moment, I'm not sure if the echoes of that laughter are real… or still inside my head.
