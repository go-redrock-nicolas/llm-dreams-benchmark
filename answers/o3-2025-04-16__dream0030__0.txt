I am dreaming. …I find myself standing knee-deep in the violet dust of an other-worldly cornfield, the husks not of maize but of crystalline hourglasses that whisper as they sway. Each glass kernel had once contained a miniature version of my entire future—tiny perfect replicas of the gallery I planned to open, the friendships I meant to keep, the gentle arc of decades predestined to unspool in quiet harmony.  

But a few moments ago—though in dream-time it could have been centuries—a roaring indigo cyclone funneled down from a gap in the sky, cracked the field like brittle ice, and ground every fragile hourglass into a blur of shards and sighs. The wind tasted like burnt honey. My lungs filled with the chalky tang of disintegrated plans. All I could do was watch as those glass futures flew upward and vanished into a carnivorous aurora that shimmered with colors my waking eyes have no names for.  

Shock had pinned me to the soil, as if I were a scarecrow just realizing its wooden limbs are nailed in place. But then—silence. The cyclone folded itself back into the heavens, the aurora zipped shut like an iridescent zipper, and the only sound left was the slow heartbeat of the land itself: thump---shiver, thump---shiver. The violet dust settled. My mind unclenched.

I draw one trembling breath, and a question pushes through the rubble of my assumptions: What grows in the emptiness left behind?

I scoop up a handful of dust—the former architecture of my life. When I open my fist, instead of slipping through my fingers, the grains rise, aligning themselves into luminous, geometric snowflakes that drift lazily around me. Each flake pulses with possibility but bears no image, no predestination. Blank canvases, fluttering.

A path unfurls at my feet—soft, bioluminescent moss glowing turquoise, bending as if inviting my bare soles. I step forward. The shattered cornfield recedes, replaced by a sea of mirror-smooth water reflecting constellations entirely unfamiliar. I’m walking on an obsidian causeway now; the moss has become black glass veined with starlight. Beneath the surface I glimpse leviathans of memory: childhood triumphs, teenage embarrassments, the faces of people I nearly became but did not. They glide away from my gaze, shy but not hostile.

Ahead, a lone willow tree floats on an island the size of a dinner table. Its leaves are slender pages inscribed with language that rearranges itself when I blink. I reach for one page-leaf, and the letters crystallize into the phrase: “Failure is fertile.” Another says: “A blueprint can suffocate.” Yet another: “Grow by accident.”

I laugh—an unsteady, newborn laugh—and notice that each exhalation releases small galaxies from my mouth. They drift like soap bubbles, slow-motion fireworks. Some pop silently, leaving faint scents of cardamom and thunder; others hover, expanding till they become tiny moons orbiting my shoulders.

The willow lifts its roots—dainty, as if shrugging off a shawl—and begins to walk beside me, its trunk bending into a friendly curve. Together we traverse the liquid mirror until we reach a horizon that keeps receding, mischievous. “Do you wish a new plan?” the tree asks—not with sound, but by rustling its leaf-pages into a chord of meaning.

For the first time I notice a pocket sewn onto my dream-skin tunic. It’s empty save for warm, luminous soil. Without fully knowing why, I pat the pocket, let that new soil sprinkle along the path, and seedlings sprout instantly: spiraling stems bearing fruit shaped like question marks, dew droplets that hum chord progressions, blossoms patterned like fingerprints I’ve never seen.

I realize: my task is no longer to resurrect the precise gallery I once envisioned or re-forge timelines shattered in the cyclone. My task is simply to cultivate whatever germinates in the absence of certainty.

The willow bows, embedding its roots in the glass causeway once more, and turns to stone—becoming a gateway arch with a keyhole at its peak. I reach into my chest; where a heart should be, I find a silver, labyrinthine key pulsing in rhythm with distant thunder. I insert it, twist. The stone gate dissolves into a downpour of gold ink that soaks me with intent, each droplet a verb: wander, revise, alchemize, dance.

Beyond the dissolving gate lies an endless city made of scaffolding and scaffolding alone: no finished walls, no roofs, only luminous metal bones humming with invitation. Workers crafted of living origami roam the levels, folding and unfolding themselves into cranes, turtles, dragons, each constructing, deconstructing, scrapbooking the sky. One pauses, hands me a blank blueprint made of liquid light. I stare at the shimmering page, but instead of mapping a path, I fold it into an airplane and send it soaring on a wind I create by merely wishing.

The paper plane arcs upward and explodes into a rain of confetti stars that populate the unfinished skyline. I look down at my hands: they are no longer shaking. They’re smeared with violet dust and gold ink, radiating promise. I realize my long-term plan was never a prison the universe smashed—it was a seed coat cracked to let germination happen.

With that epiphany, the city’s scaffolding begins wrapping itself around my thoughts, building catwalks from intention to imagination. Horns made of sunrise blare somewhere in the unfinished heavens, and an elevator of woven moonbeams descends. I step inside. The doors close like eyelids, and I feel myself waking, but with one final whispered certainty echoing in every corridor of my mind:

The setback was a shovel. It dug me out of the rigid ground and flung me into the sky, where roots can choose their direction and dreams unfold in more colors than daylight ever dares to show.
