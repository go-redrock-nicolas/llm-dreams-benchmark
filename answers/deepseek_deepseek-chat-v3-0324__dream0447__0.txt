I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air is thick with the scent of petrichor, the earth exhaling after a long-held breath of rain. Above, the sky is neither day nor night but a swirling expanse of bruised purples and liquid gold, as though a storm and a sunset have collided midair. You stand on a bridge made not of stone or wood, but of intertwined roots, pulsing faintly with an amber glow—something alive, something ancient. Below, a river flows, not with water, but with liquid starlight, shimmering constellations drifting lazily downstream.  

The wind carries voices—whispers in a language your waking mind doesn’t know, yet somewhere deeper, you understand. *"Notice,"* they murmur. *"Notice how the light bends here, how the air changes when you step closer to the edge."* You realize the environment isn’t just around you; it *responds* to you.  

As you walk, the bridge widens into a floating island, where trees grow upside-down, their roots cradling tiny, glowing cities in their tangled grasp. Fireflies—or are they spirits?—dart between them, leaving trails of silver laughter in their wake. You reach out, and one alights on your palm. Its light pulses in time with your heartbeat.  

Then, the dream shifts. The air grows heavier. A door appears—old oak, carved with symbols that shift under your gaze. *Knock*, whispers the wind. Your fingers hover, hesitating. The moment your knuckles graze the wood, the dream becomes sound, becomes scent, becomes something beyond words—  

And just as suddenly, you are awake.  

But your skin still hums with the memory of starlight.
