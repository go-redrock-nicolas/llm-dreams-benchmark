I am dreaming. Find myself standing on a cliff overlooking the vast ocean. The sun, just beginning to set, paints the sky in shades of pink, orange, and purple. The waves crash against the jagged rocks below, their thunderous roar a constant reminder of the power of nature. I feel a sense of peace and tranquility wash over me, despite the looming realization of my own mortality.

As I stand there, lost in thought, I notice a figure emerging from the water. It's a woman, her long, dark hair plastered to her head, and her skin glistening in the dying sunlight. She walks towards me with a determined step, her eyes fixed on mine. We meet at the edge of the cliff, and without a word, she extends her hand to me.

Riskily, I place my hand in hers, feeling an intense electricity surge through my body. She pulls me towards her, and for a moment, I see the entire universe in her eyes. We stand there, suspended in time, as the world around us fades away.

Then, without warning, we plummet into the ocean below. The water engulfs us, enveloping us in its icy cold embrace. I feel the pressure building inside my chest, threatening to burst forth. Yet, somehow, I remain calm. I have accepted my fate.

As we descend deeper into the abyss, the darkness closes in around us. I can no longer see her face, but I can feel her presence beside me. We continue our journey, not knowing where we are going or what awaits us. But we're together, and that's all that matters.

Suddenly, a brilliant light shimmers in the distance. It grows larger and brighter, until it envelops us completely. I feel a sense of overwhelming warmth and safety wash over me, and the pressure in my chest dissipates. As the light fades away, I find myself standing on the beach, the sun now high in the sky.

I turn around, expecting to see the woman who shared this journey with me. But she's gone. In her place stands a surfboard, resting on the sand. It's a symbol of the risks we take, the connections we make, and the journeys we embark on. Even in death, our legacies live on.

I pick up the surfboard and walk towards the ocean, ready to face whatever lies ahead, with a newfound appreciation for the fleeting beauty of life and the permanent mark we leave behind.
