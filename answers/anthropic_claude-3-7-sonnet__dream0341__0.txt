I am dreaming. The weight of another's life presses down on my shoulders like gravity intensified a hundredfold. I'm trudging through a landscape where the ground shifts between solid earth and something resembling quicksand, each step requiring deliberate calculation. The sky above isn't really a sky at all—it's a ceiling of churning obsidian clouds, occasionally split by veins of electric blue lightning that illuminate everything in harsh, unnatural light.

Before me staggers a figure—someone I cannot quite see clearly but feel connected to by an invisible tether that pulls painfully at my chest. They're weakening, stumbling, their silhouette wavering like a candle flame in wind. The knowledge burns within me: if they fall, something irreplaceable will be lost forever.

Around us, the world is in magnificent decay. Buildings with impossible architecture—part Gothic cathedral, part biological organism—tilt at dangerous angles, shedding tiles and stones that dissolve into butterflies when they hit the ground. The butterflies then reform into timepieces that tick with deafening volume before melting into puddles of luminescent liquid.

I call out to the figure ahead, but my voice emerges as music instead of words—a haunting melody I somehow recognize as my own childhood fear transformed into sound. The figure turns slightly, and for a moment, I glimpse not a face but a mirror reflecting my own expression, distorted by concern and determination.

The path ahead narrows into a bridge made of interwoven memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers—and beneath it swirls not water but forgotten conversations and missed opportunities, their whispers rising like mist. I know with dreamlike certainty that crossing this bridge is our only chance at survival.

My companion falters at the bridge's edge, and I lunge forward, my fingers brushing against fabric that feels simultaneously like silk and old parchment. The connection sends a shock wave of shared consciousness between us—their pain becoming mine, my strength flowing into them—and together we take the first step onto the uncertain crossing, the responsibility binding us more powerfully than any physical chain ever could.
