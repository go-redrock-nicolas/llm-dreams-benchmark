I am dreaming. I find myself floating through an iridescent forest where the trees grow upside down, their roots reaching toward a lavender sky streaked with ribbons of shifting gold. Each leaf pulses with its own internal light, creating a symphony of colors that feels both familiar and otherworldly. The air around me tastes like memories - sweet like childhood summers mixed with the tang of possibilities yet to unfold.

As I drift between the inverted branches, I notice my body becoming increasingly translucent, my edges blurring into the surrounding atmosphere. My thoughts manifest as tiny glowing spheres that orbit around me like playful planets, each one containing a different expectation I've held onto throughout my life. I can see them clearly now - crystallized hopes, rigid plans, unyielding beliefs - all shimmering with an almost painful brightness.

Suddenly, a warm wind whispers through the forest, carrying with it the scent of rain that's never fallen. Each of my expectation-spheres begins to soften, their hard edges melting like sugar in warm tea. As they dissolve, I feel an immense lightness spreading through my ethereal form. The forest around me seems to exhale with relief, and the trees begin to dance in impossible ways, their branches weaving patterns that defy geometry.

I understand now, in this dream-logic way, that my expectations have been like invisible cages - beautiful perhaps, but constraining nonetheless. As each sphere dissolves completely, new possibilities bloom in their place: flowers made of starlight, singing crystals that tell stories of futures that never were, and doorways that lead to everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.

The forest around me continues to shift and transform, teaching me without words that reality is far more fluid and forgiving than my expectations ever allowed it to be. I feel myself becoming one with this understanding, my consciousness expanding like ripples in an infinite pond, touching everything while holding onto nothing.

As the dream begins to fade, the last thing I notice is my own laughter, which falls from my lips as butterflies made of pure light, each one carrying away a different should, must, or have-to into the endless lavender sky.
