I am dreaming. …step barefoot onto an avenue that seems woven from moon-bleached parchment. It crackles softly beneath your feet, yet leaves no crease or footprint, as though it is both solid and only an idea. Overhead, the sky is a lacquered indigo bowl, splashed with constellations you’ve never studied—glyphs that look almost like letters but shift whenever you try to read them. The air carries the perfume of citrus and distant rain, and every breath tastes faintly of electricity, as if a storm recently whispered through.

Buildings curve around you in impossible geometry: archways that bend back on themselves, doorways that hover inches above the ground, towers built of glassy petals stacked like origami. Windows flicker and dim as though they’re breathing organisms. Color here shimmers on its own accord: reds pulse like heartbeats, blues ripple in slow tidal rhythms, and gold drips down the walls before evaporating into glittering fog.

The inhabitants—tall, flaxen-skinned figures with eyes the copper of autumn leaves—glide across the plaza on silent, sandal-less feet. Their clothing is flowing filament, translucent and prismatic, trailing after them like comet tails. They speak constantly, but their voices are silent, mouths moving in soundless rivers. You can’t understand a single syllable, yet the cadence feels almost musical, vibrating in your chest like the plucked string of a distant harp.

One approaches you, smiling with every muscle—eyebrows lifted, cheeks glowing, shoulders relaxed—offering a sphere no larger than a peach, its surface swirling with opalescent clouds. Unsure of etiquette, you place your palm beneath it; the orb rises, buoyant, as though drawn by your heartbeat. The stranger presses their fingertips to their sternum, then to their lips, then arcs their hand toward a spiral pattern stamped into the marble-soft ground. You mimic the gesture carefully. They beam, the warm amber in their eyes brightening.

A tide of pure emotion washes from them to you—no words, only sensation: Welcome, traveler. Wonder. Delight. Dimly you realize this place communicates through currents of feeling, mirrored in movement and light. Words are redundant here; meaning is painted directly onto the air.

You try speaking back with your body. First, gratitude: you roll your shoulders open, unclench your hands, let your breath bloom like a slow-motion sunrise. Then curiosity: a tilt of the head, an outstretched hand toward the swirling orb. The figure nods, turning the sphere until an image blossoms on its surface—an aerial view of winding canals lined with bioluminescent lilies the size of small boats. They mime rowing, arms pushing against invisible water, then point toward a distant archway pulsing sapphire.

You set off together.

As you walk, the pavement beneath your feet shifts from parchment texture to cool, mirrored water that supports your weight with supple resilience. Each step leaves a burst of phosphorescent footprints, fading like fireflies. From somewhere unseen, liquid chimes play a scale each time your heel lifts—a crystalline xylophone tuned to your pulse. The city seems to learn your rhythm and harmonize with it, weaving your footfalls into a symphony.

Crossing a bridge spun from glass reeds, you encounter artisans painting murals onto the night itself. They pluck pigments from bowls of color and brush them directly onto empty space; nebulas bloom, hovering, then spiral away as drifting holograms. Every stroke reveals memories not your own—sunsets over oceans of lavender, flocks of metallic birds, laughter that feels like wind in cathedral corridors. When one artist notices your fascination, she offers her brush. You accept. The bristles feel like cool rain against your palm. You swipe it through nothingness, and suddenly a memory of your childhood kite—red, diamond-shaped, caught against a summer sky—appears, fluttering above the plaza. The spectators give a collective exhale of pleasure. You realize you’ve spoken your first word here, but in color and motion rather than sound.

Your guide cups a hand, lifts it upward in a spiral: Shall we continue? You nod.

Beyond the sapphire archway, you descend into the canal quarter. Water here is viscous as liquid glass, luminescing violet, yet parts smoothly for the craft: narrow boats shaped like calligraphy strokes. You step aboard. Instead of oars, the guide trails fingertips along the surface, sending ripples that propel you forward. The canal walls shimmer with bioluminescent script—stories recorded in undulating curves. Occasionally a glyph drifts off the wall, hovering like a jellyfish before settling back down. You skim one with your finger and feel a rush of narrative: the tale of a storm that fell in love with a mountain and carved valleys in its embrace.

You can’t help laughing—a sound that, shockingly, emerges as a plume of violet butterflies from your lips. They flit away, dissolving into sparks. The guide turns, delighted, and sends a ribbon of teal mist spiraling upward in response: their laughter. Even without shared language, you understand each other perfectly.

Farther on, the canal widens into a circular pool. The water lifts itself into columns, arranging into twelve liquid statues—each representing a concept: Joy, Solitude, Memory, Anticipation, Grief, Courage, Doubt, Revelation, Innocence, Time, Mischief, and Becoming. One column tilts toward you: Doubt, its surface fractured like cracked ice. A droplet leaps from it and lands upon your chest. Instantly you recall every moment you hesitated in life—crossroads, unfinished stories, swallowed confessions. Yet instead of shame, the emotion passes through you like clear wind and leaves you lighter. Doubt recedes, replaced by Becoming, whose surface flows continuously into new shapes: sprouting leaves, wings, galaxies. A quiet warmth spreads through you, a permission to transform.

Your guide raises the orb once more. Inside it, the swirling clouds part to reveal a reflection of this very dreamscape, then compress into a single point of light. They press the orb into your hands, folding your fingers around it as though gifting a seed. A universal gesture: This is yours now. Keep it.

You look down. Through the translucent shell you glimpse constellations rearranging into characters you finally understand—your own name written in mineral starlight. The moment you recognize it, the orb melts into a glow that soaks into your skin, sinking to the center of your chest like a second heart.

The guide bows: a slow, sweeping arc. You mirror the movement. Gratitude flows back and forth between you like golden tide.

And then—softly, without warning—the city begins to fade. Colors drip upward, buildings fold into origami birds and fly into the dark. The canal unravels into ribbons of violet silk. Even the sky’s indigo swirls down the drain of a silent whirlwind until only blackness remains, sprinkled with the fading headlights of memory.

You wake, sheets tangled around your legs, a faint scent of citrus and rain still clinging to your hair. On your palm lies a tiny smear of almost-invisible phosphorescence, pulsing once…twice…before vanishing. Yet inside, somewhere just behind your heartbeat, a new luminescence settles—the quiet certainty that, even without words, you can always speak in color, motion, and feeling.

And you rise to meet the day with every gesture painted in that dream-born light.
