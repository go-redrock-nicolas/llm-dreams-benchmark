I am dreaming. The stage is set, the stage is empty, and the stage is waiting. 
I am about to give a speech to a large audience, and as I step onto the stage, the footlights flicker on. I walk to the podium, adjusting my microphone, but I cannot see the audience - there is only an endless expanse of darkness before me. 
The silence is deafening. A single spotlight illuminates the podium, and in this moment, I realize I have no notes, no outline. The world seems to hold its breath.
As I open my mouth to speak, a voice - not my own but a melodic whisper seemingly from the ether - fills the auditorium. It speaks words I don't understand, yet each syllable carries a profound and comforting familiarity. 
Gradually, the voice fades away, and I become aware that I must act. I lift my hands, and they begin to glow with an ethereal light that slowly illuminates the room. Illuminated in the glow are the audience members, their faces disoriented, as if awakening from some trance-like state. 
Realization hits me - they are not here to listen to me; they are here to witness. As the stage light fades, the audience begins to disperse, each member walking in a different direction, leaving only an empty stage and the faint echoes of that whispering voice.
The curtain falls. I am still dreaming.
