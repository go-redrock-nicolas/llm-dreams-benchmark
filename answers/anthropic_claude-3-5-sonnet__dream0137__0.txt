I am dreaming. I find myself ascending the worn marble steps of an imposing courthouse that seems to stretch impossibly high into a storm-darkened sky. The building pulses with an otherworldly energy, its classical columns appearing to breathe and shift when viewed from the corner of my eye. My judicial robes feel unusually heavy, as if woven from lead and secrets.

Inside the courtroom, the gallery is filled with shadowy figures whose faces constantly morph and change - one moment they wear masks of respectability, the next revealing snarling, desperate expressions. Their whispers echo off the walls like serpents slithering through dead leaves.

Evidence materializes before me in strange forms: smoking letters that burn my fingers but leave no marks, recordings played on devices that shouldn't exist, photographs that move and change when I try to examine them closely. I can feel the truth hiding within them, but it darts away like a fish in murky water whenever I reach for it.

Anonymous notes appear in my chambers, written in ink that seems to crawl across the page. Each threat is more creative than the last - my family tree withering from the roots up, my memories being erased one by one, my very existence being questioned in the fabric of reality.

But something peculiar is happening: with each attempt to sway my judgment, I feel my spine crystallizing into diamond, my conviction hardening like cooling steel. The pressure meant to break me is instead forging me into something stronger. Even as the courthouse walls begin to melt and the floor turns to quicksand beneath my feet, I remain anchored to my duty.

The defendants keep changing faces - sometimes they're powerful politicians, other times corporate titans, occasionally they appear as literal monsters with too many teeth and hollow eyes. But their guilt or innocence glows above them like aurora borealis, impossible to ignore despite their attempts to obscure it.

As I open my mouth to deliver the verdict, time begins to fold in on itself. The courtroom splinters into a kaleidoscope of consequences - I can simultaneously see every possible outcome of my decision rippling out into the future like waves from a stone dropped in still water...

I feel my consciousness starting to surface from the dream, but the weight of justice remains heavy in my hands, more real than reality itself.
