I am dreaming. As my vivid dream unfolds, I find myself standing in the middle of a bustling city square. The sun beats down mercilessly, casting long shadows across the concrete beneath my feet. A faint static crackles through the air, like the dying breath of a failing radio signal.

Suddenly, my heightened senses pick up subtle but alarming details that seem to have escaped others' notice. I spot thin wisps of an unnatural mist curling from the sewers, carrying an acrid scent that burns the inside of my nostrils. The nearby digital billboard flickers erratically, its garbled message flashing one word repeatedly: "DANGER."

My pulse quickens as I observe people going about their day, oblivious to the looming threat. Their casual laughter and chatter feel deafening in my ears, a jarring disconnect from the mounting tension within me. The earth trembles almost imperceptibly beneath the soles of my shoes, like the first whispered promise of an earthquake.

As adrenaline floods my system, the world around me becomes hyper-focused. Colors seem more vibrant, every sound amplified. The city's normally chaotic hum transforms into a cacophony of ticking time bombs waiting to detonate. I notice how the patterns of the pedestrians shift, like pieces on a chessboard moving towards their fated positions.

The pressure building inside me grows too much to contain. I open my mouth to shout a warning, to alert these unsuspecting souls to the horror that awaits them. But before I can make a sound, the dream shifts and distorts, reality warping into something darker still. The last thing I see is the city square transforming into an abyss of shadows, as a deafening roar heralds the beginning of absolute chaos.
