I am dreaming. With a surge of determination, I jump out of bed and gaze at the clock. It’s early morning, but the sun isn’t up yet. My mind races with vivid images and sensations of what lies ahead. I pull on my running shoes and step outside into the crisp air. The world feels new and alive as I begin to jog down the quiet streets.
Slowly, the dream becomes more detailed and immersive. I can feel the cool breeze brushing against my face, hear the sound of my breath, and feel my heart pounding in my chest. I am in control now. I can see myself running faster, feeling more energized with every step, and feeling a deep sense of satisfaction as I complete my goal. 
These vivid, imaginative dreams feel so real that they leave me with a sense of purpose and motivation as I wake up and face the day ahead. The dream lingers, fueling my drive to get back on track and persevere through any challenges that come my way.
