I am dreaming. …hear the mechanical groan of gears grinding and water rushing in at an impossible rate. The fluorescent lights above flicker, casting the swelling water in ghastly hues of green and blue. As the frigid liquid climbs past your knees, icy needles stab at your skin. Your breath grows frantic; every inhale trembles with the sharp scent of cold metal and distant rain. The walls, slick now, glimmer with reflections—memories, faces you almost recognize, flit behind the glass as if trapped in their own worlds.

Your hands press desperately against the panel, but the buttons are unreadable, their labels swirling in dizzying, liquid script. The elevator shudders, as if mourning itself. 

Suddenly, your mind sharpens—a sound stirs in the rush: a low, melodic hum, almost lullaby-like, curling from the ceiling vents. You sense the pressure of invisible eyes upon you, not menacing, but watchful. The water, now up to your waist, feels less like a threat and more like a strange embrace—a beckoning. You gasp, half in terror, half in awe, as the lights abruptly transform. 

Above, the peeling ceiling peels back like the lid of a can, revealing not cables and darkness, but an endless swirl of night sky: constellations pirouette in impossible patterns, galaxies spin like clockwork. The water rises, but instead of suffocating, you find yourself buoyed upward. Your feet lift from the floor and you are floating through that opened portal, weightless, whispering past a thousand glimmering stars, the elevator forgotten.

You are not drowning, but flying—each breath filling your lungs with cool starlight, your fear dissolving into the infinite wonder all around. The rusted elevator disappears behind you, its doors closing softly, as you drift into a universe made of dreams, stitched together by your own fantastical imagination.
