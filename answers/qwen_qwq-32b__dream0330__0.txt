I am dreaming. I am preparing to meet my partner's family for the first time. The air is thick with anticipation and the scent of unfamiliar spices. Before me stretches an entranceway made of shimmering, translucent glass that morphs colors as I step closer. It hums a low, melodic tune, and I realize it’s not a door but a living entity.

The interior is a vast, open expanse with a ceiling that mirrors the night sky, yet stars are arranged into constellations I don’t recognize. In the center stands a circular table, around which seven figures await me—my partner sits beside a towering figure with skin like polished onyx and hair that flows like liquid mercury. Another has eyes that shift between gold and silver, while a third wears clothing woven from vines that seem to breathe.

Unexpectedly, the floor beneath my feet transforms into a reflective pond. My reflection shows not my face but a symbol: a crescent moon cradling a glowing orb. The family members begin to chant in a tongue unfamiliar yet hauntingly familiar. Their voices intertwine with the hum of the entrance, creating a harmony that resonates in my bones.

The eldest gestures toward the table, where a bowl of iridescent liquid appears. My partner gives me a slight, encouraging nod. The norm here is to drink, but I hesitate. The liquid pulses like a heart, and as I lift the bowl, the symbol in the pond flares brightly. Drinking it feels like swallowing liquid starlight—it cascades through me, invoking a strange euphoria and sudden understanding of their language and traditions.

Laughter erupts around me, warm and melodic. A family member beckons me to a garden beyond, its flowers emitting soft glows and changing hues with my emotions. Here, I learn that touching the petals allows me to glimpse memories, both theirs and mine. The family shares stories through the blossoms, each bloom revealing a different era of their history, their struggles, their joys.

In the garden’s center stands a tree with bark like swirling galaxies. My partner guides my hand to touch it, and visions flood—ancestors who traversed starways, celebrated with rituals of light, faced cataclysms, and rebuilt their world. The tree itself is a chronicle of their heartbeat.

Suddenly, the ground quakes. The constellations above convulse, and a beam of light strikes the tree. The family murmurs urgently. My symbol in the pond and the tree’s patterns begin to align. They turn to me, eyes gleaming with expectation. The eldest speaks, “The alignment is rare—once in millennia. Your presence here is no accident.”

A choice looms: to flee the unknown, or embrace this call, intertwining my fate with theirs. My partner’s hand finds mine. The air thrums with possibility. I close my eyes, drawing strength from the starlight within, and step forward...\n
