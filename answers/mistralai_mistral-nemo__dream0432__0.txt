I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the heart of a vast, lush forest, yet I feel a profound sense of scarcity, as if there's barely enough life around me. The sun, a shrunken, jeopardized entity, struggles to pierce through the dense canopy above, casting elongated, fragile shadows upon the forest floor. I am amidst an ocean of greenery, yet every leaf seems wilted, every tree a withered conveyor of pity.

I reach out to touch the nearest tree trunk, its bark coarse and dry beneath my fingertips. My touch elicits a faint, whispered sigh, a barely-there recount of a time when life flowed freely within its veins. The air is thick with the scent of decay, not the rich, earthy aroma that should accompany autumn's approach, but a stark, alarming decay, as if the very essence of life is fleeing.

I walk further, my feet crunching on twigs that snap as if they've been emptied of their inner strength. The forest's symphony is eerily silent, no birdsong or rustling underbrush. Instead, there's a√°sense of a encroaching quiet, like the whispering calm before an impending storm, or the hushed anticipation in a crowded theater just before the curtains rise. I glance at the canopy again, expecting to see leaves dancing in the wind, but there's nothing, just an oppressive stillness.

Ahead, I notice a deer, its skeleton painted with flesh, standing over a stream that flows listlessly, barely carving a path through the earth. Its eyes, though filled with life, reflect the same despair I feel. Around us, mushrooms sprout from the ground, their caps glistening like tears against the muted landscape. Each one seems to tell a story of loss, of a world fading away.

I kneel down by the stream, cupping my hands to collect water. It flows reluctantly, as if reluctant to part with its bed. As I lift my hands to my lips, I notice that the water is tinted, a faint, almost imperceptible gray. It tastes of salt and absence. I let the liquid dribble back into the stream, watching as it flows on, unchanged, unchanged, unchanged.

Suddenly, a gust of wind sweeps through the trees, its touch icy and mournful. The leaves rustle, their voices desperate and plaintive, crying out like a chorus of lost souls begging for mercy. I look up, expecting to see the onset of a storm, but the sky remains an unyielding, impenetrable wall of gray, offering neither rain nor relief.

The dream shifts, the air around me growing colder, heavier. The forest begins to fade, its edges dissolving into a swirling mist. I try to call out, to scream, to demand answers, but my voice falters, a lifeless echo swallowed by the expanding vacuum. My hands grasp at nothing, my heart pounds, loneliness and fear threatening to consume me. And then, darkness.
