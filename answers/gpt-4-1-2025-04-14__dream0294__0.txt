I am dreaming.

A golden afternoon light pours through the windows of a room I don’t recognize, casting honeyed patterns on the walls. Everything inside seems quieter than reality, as if wrapped in a hush between breaths. In the center of the room stands a cluster of people—faces both familiar and unknown, softened with gentle smiles and attentive eyes. I notice immediately what draws their gaze: it's me. More specifically, it's the shy sketches and scribbles I’ve always hidden away, taped up across one wall. My hands tingle with the old insecurity; I brace myself for polite dismissal or awkward silence.

Instead, I hear laughter—soft and warm—followed by words that flutter toward me like butterflies. “These are breathtaking,” someone says. “There’s so much feeling in your strokes,” another murmurs. The crowd agrees, speaking in gentle waves of admiration, spinning my insecurities into something unexpectedly precious. Each compliment lands on me like a sunbeam after years in the shadows. 

My cheeks flush, disbelieving. I almost want to step out of my own skin, to hide the trembling vulnerability that so long has clung to the art I made. Panic and elation tangle in my stomach as the world’s old scripts and limits fall away, replaced by a tide of acceptance and validation I never dared imagine. Am I worthy? Did they really mean what they said? Is it possible I’ve been wrong about myself all along?

As the dream deepens, I feel something shift within me—a parting of storm clouds, a deep-down exhale. The room grows brighter. Every time praise comes, it pulls apart another layer of self-doubt, exposing something tender but beautiful: hope. I soak it in, savoring each word, letting the contradiction between their praise and my self-perception light the path toward a gentler truth.

I watch as my old fears melt—just for a moment—beneath the warmth of unexpected kindness. I wake with the sense that maybe, just maybe, the dream is asking me to believe.
