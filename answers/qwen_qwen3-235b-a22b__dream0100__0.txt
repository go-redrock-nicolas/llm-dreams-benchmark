I am dreaming. I join a close-knit community with complex social dynamics that have developed over generations. As I try to find my place within these established relationships, I quickly realize that the path to acceptance — to understanding — threads itself through the most curious of trials.

The village is carved into the side of a mountain, but not of stone. The village is organic — trees grow shaped as homes, their bark polished by generations of feet walking over their roots, their insides humming with the memories of the people who’ve lived there. The air glows with pale bioluminescent insects, and moss blankets the ground like breathless velvet. Here, the sky doesn’t stretch infinitely — instead, it arches like the inside of a great shell, shifting colors with the moods of the community.

They are not all human, either. Some of the villagers have eyes like stars burning behind glass, or limbs that snake and bend like roots seeking nourishment. They wear garments woven from stormcloud silk and moonlight thread. Their voices overlap when they speak, as if echoing from somewhere deeper than their chests — a resonance of group memory.

I arrive as an outsider, and that alone casts me into caution. Trust is slow and silent, like the growth of a redwood.

At the village’s center stands the Heartspire — not a building, but a living tree with twin trunks. They say the two trunks were once one, but the Great Schism beneath the surface cracked the heart of the land, and now the Heartspire holds the scars of that ancient division. The villagers use it as a silent judge — decisions are spoken beneath its limbs, and it either leaks sap like tears of sorrow or releases a fragrance like newborn spring.

I meet Elira, whose eyes are mirrors reflecting your emotions back to you. She teaches me the ancient word-weaving technique — a speech that must be sung and traced in the air all at once. Without fluency in this, I will remain voiceless. Around me, the tribes gather for the Night Meritually, where each person presents what they’ve offered the village that season. Some bring new medicines, others bring lullabies to pass on to infants, some defend the forest-line from creeping shadows.

I struggle at first. I have no ancestral skills, no inherited memories of the river’s secrets or the hunger of the wind. But during my trial-night — when I must give something not learned but *known* from within — I clasp hands with Kinlot, an elder with stag horns braided in silver thread. And when our skin touches, I see glimpses of him from a thousand past lifetimes — as a lover, a foe, a father — and suddenly, I understand: this place has *always* known me.

We are echoes of previous blends. The same souls inside different lives. Rebound chords, playing new melodies we swear we've felt before.

I begin to participate fully — joining the Silkwatch to guard the cocoon groves from flame-spiders, learning the Lamentlang of the winds to command them gently. I start grouping with Mers and Thren, who are lifelong image-rivals yet in unspoken unison in art and healing. They challenge me. Destroy me. Rebuild me.

Yet, there is shadow beneath the beauty. Not all are content with my presence. The Upholders — those who believe only bloodlines should access deeper wisdom — whisper that I am *undesigned*, built from threads that do not belong in this woven map of time.

I uncover a secret: the fissure between the twin trunks of the Heartspire was not natural. It was *caused*. Not by force, but by betrayal — the exile of one half of the soul of the village. Some of the elders knew of it and remained silent, choosing peace over truth.

The knowledge unravels everything.

The dream becomes a choice: accept this world and its quiet rot, or unearth the buried history and risk shattering harmony. I wake not with the sun, but with the scream of the earth splitting again.

And I know I must return. Not just to dream, but to mend — or destroy.
