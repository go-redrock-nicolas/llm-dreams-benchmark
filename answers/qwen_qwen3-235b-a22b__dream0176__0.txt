I am dreaming.  

The steering wheel vibrates like a living thing, its leather grip pulsing with a heartbeat that isn’t mine. The road ahead warps, asphalt melting into a river of black glass that reflects a sky smeared with bruised hues—crimson, indigo, the feverish gold of a half-remembered fever. My foot slams the phantom brake, the pedal dissolving into sand, trickling through my fingers as the car hurtles downward, faster now, as though gravity itself has turned traitor.  

The traffic ahead isn’t cars. They’re shadows, silhouettes of vehicles flickering like static on a TV screen, their taillights bleeding into the air like smears of wet paint. Horns blare in dissonant chords, notes that coil around my throat and squeeze. The engine roars, but it’s not an engine—it’s a primal scream, the growl of some primordial beast trapped beneath the hood, thrashing against the metal cage.  

Then the world fractures.  

The car lurches sideways, tearing off the road and into a void where the laws of physics curl up and die. We plummet through layers of reality—a forest of towering mushrooms with gills that hum, a city of floating clocks ticking backward, a desert where the sand is made of shattered mirrors. Each layer flashes by in a heartbeat, a montage of impossibilities stitching themselves to my retinas.  

Inside the car, the dashboard cracks open like an egg, tendrils of glowing green light spilling out, coiling around the seats. The radio crackles to life, whispering in a language that isn’t language, vowels that taste like iron, consonants that itch like static. The windshield becomes a kaleidoscope, fracturing the horizon into jagged shards of *almost*: almost safety, almost escape, almost a face I recognize.  

And then—impact.  

But it isn’t metal meeting metal. It’s silence. A white-hot starburst, a collision of souls, and suddenly I’m outside the car, weightless, falling upward into a sky now stitched with veins of silver light. The road below twists into a serpent, swallowing its own tail, while the shadows from the traffic materialize around me, faceless and flickering, their hands brushing my skin like smoke.  

One of them steps forward. It wears my face, but wrong—eyes too wide, mouth a smudge of ash. It whispers, *“You’ve been driving this way forever,”* and the words unravel into crows, black wings slicing the air.  

I wake up gasping, the taste of gasoline on my tongue and the echo of a siren’s wail in my bones. But the dream clings, a second skin, as I realize the keys are still in my pocket. And the road? It never ended. It’s waiting.
