I am dreaming.

At first, everything around me is painted in the absolute black and white of certainty—a forest where every tree is perfectly straight, trunks bisected by clear lines dividing shadow from light. They march in infinite, precise rows, as if reality itself is composed of immutable truths. Above, the sky is a smooth porcelain dome, flawlessly blue, unblemished by even the ghost of a cloud.

I wander through this orderly landscape, comforted by the clarity. I know that the birds only sing at sunrise, that water always flows downhill, and that laughter means happiness. These things have always been. I am as sure of them as I am of my own heartbeat.

But then, as dreams do, the world ripples. The rows of trees gently begin to sway and bend; their shadows bleed and merge where they once stood rigid. A curious wind stirs, thick with the scent of jasmine and cardamom, and with it comes laughter—ethereal and unfamiliar. It is a laughter that rings bittersweet, colored with a tint of longing I had never noticed before.

I follow the sound and find myself in a clearing, where people I do not know speak in tongues I do not understand, yet their meanings bloom in my mind like wildflowers: Language, they say, is not a fixed mirror of the world, but a living net cast over it, catching only some of the sparkling, shifting truths. In this place, water sometimes flows away from the mountains, laughter can signal sorrow or respect, and words for "love" include both certainty and doubt.

A memory rises in me, something I always believed—a smile always means friendliness, warmth, an open door. Yet here, I see smiles exchanged between rivals, painted as masks, concealing rather than revealing meaning. The objective becomes subjective, the universal now cultural. What I held as ironclad dissolves in mist.

My vision expands as if seeing with new eyes. The straight rows of trees spiral and loop in dizzying designs, some reaching down rather than up, their roots caressing the stars. A thousand voices weave together, each layering a different shade, making the world resonate with complexity and possibility.

Awash in these revelations, I do not feel lost, but liberated. I am a cartographer at the edge of the map, understanding that its blank spaces are opportunities, not hazards. Certainty gives way to curiosity; I walk not with answers, but with questions. Every ripple in the world asks for a gentle touch, an open mind, and a willingness to discover.

Reconsidering my worldview, I see culture flickering in all things—truths shifting like the colors of an opal in sunlight. I become both dreamer and dreamed, a wanderer in a kaleidoscopic world where I no longer assume my truth is the only one. In this shimmering uncertainty, I find beauty, humility, and wonder—an invitation to wake up anew.
