I am dreaming. :D  

The air around me hums with a golden, honeyed glow, as if the very atmosphere is alive with whispered secrets. I stand in a grand, endless library—shelves stretching into the misty heights above, their contents pulsing with soft, bioluminescent light. The books breathe. They shift slightly on their own, as if restless with the knowledge they hold.  

And then, I realize—I am not alone.  

A figure moves beside me, their presence both familiar and otherworldly. It’s *them*—the person I admire, the one whose essence I’ve unconsciously absorbed. Their voice, their gestures, the way they tilt their head when lost in thought—it all flows through me like a second skin. I catch my reflection in a floating mirror made of liquid mercury, and for a moment, *I am them*. My lips shape their words; my hands move with their elegant precision.  

But then, the dream shifts.  

The library walls dissolve into a vast, star-strewn void, and the figure turns to me with a knowing smile. Their eyes hold entire galaxies, swirling with unspoken wisdom. *"You wear me well,"* they murmur, their voice echoing like distant thunder. *"But who will you be when the mask falls away?"*  

Before I can answer, the stars rush inward, swallowing us both—and I wake with a gasp, the ghost of their presence still lingering on my tongue.
