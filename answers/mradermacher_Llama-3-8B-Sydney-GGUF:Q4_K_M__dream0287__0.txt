I am dreaming. I find myself drawn into a powerful group identity that begins to influence my individual choices.  Noticing this subtle shift in my autonomy, I
feel a sense of confusion and loss.   Why do I feel so disconnected from myself?    What forces are shaping me?   How can I regain control over my own life?

As I explore the dream world around me, I encounter various symbols and images that seem to hold hidden meanings.  A giant snake coiled around the
Earth's equator.  A shining golden sword embedded in a stone.  A beautiful woman with wings who beckons me forward.

I follow her path, curious about where she leads me.  She takes me to a sacred temple where ancient rituals are performed by mysterious priests.
She shows me the secret knowledge that they possess, the wisdom that has been passed down through generations.

I learn about the power of creation and destruction, the forces that shape the universe and our lives.  I understand why some sacrifices must be
made for greater good.   Why sometimes we must give up our individuality for the sake of community.

But something inside me resists this logic.   Something tells me that this is not the true purpose of life.   That there must be more to it than
this.

I wake up from my dream with a sense of uncertainty and hope.  I don't know if what I experienced was real or imaginary.
But I do know one thing: I want to find out for myself what really matters in this world.
