I am dreaming. **The Dream**  

Darkness yawns open like a hungry mouth. The air hums with static, thick with the scent of ozone and something older—burnt sugar and rusted iron. I’m standing at the edge of something vast, a void masquerading as solid ground. But I know this place. I’ve been here before.  

A doorway looms in front of me, its frame carved from bone-white wood, splintered at the edges. Through it, I see *myself* years ago—smaller, shaking, hands curled into helpless fists. That version of me is facing *them* again: the critics, the sneering voices, the crushing weight of failure pressing down like an anvil. Their laughter is jagged, metallic, echoing in spirals that drill into my skull.  

I want to turn away. I *have* turned away before. But the dream won’t let me.  

This time, though—this time is different. The shadows at my feet aren’t just swallowing me; they’re *stirring*, writhing like liquid. Shapes emerge—scraps of old battles. Torn pages of unfinished stories. Rejection letters that once made me nauseous. They rise like smoke, twisting into something new. Not monsters. *Armor.*  

I step forward. The younger me turns, eyes wide. I reach out—not to pull them away, but to press something into their hands. A key? A dagger? No. A *seed*, black as ink, pulsing like a heartbeat.  

The voices beyond the door falter. The weight in the air shudders. Something is growing—a sound like thunder, but softer. A hum. A *voice*. Not theirs. **Mine.**  

And I realize—this isn’t a nightmare.  

It’s a forge.

**Would you like to see what happens when the seed takes root? Or do you wake up here, your pulse wild but your fists unclenched?**
