I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You stand in a vast alabaster desert, dunes rippling like frozen waves beneath a pale lavender sky. Every grain of sand seems to rattle with the same thought: “Not enough.” Your pockets feel heavy with imaginary ledgers, lists of shortages you’ve spent years tending—time, love, opportunity, courage. Each step you take kicks up a plume of dust shaped like miniature hourglasses, and they spill through invisible cracks before you can cup them in your palms.

But then a hush drapes itself over the wind.

Far ahead, a single pomegranate tree appears—impossible, emerald-leafed, its trunk spiraling like a twist of cinnamon. You walk, half floating, half gliding, until you reach it. The fruit hangs low, glowing from within, seeds pulsing tiny ruby heartbeats. On the bark, letters shimmer in iridescent ink you somehow recognize as your own handwriting: “There is always possibility.”

You brush a fingertip across the words, and the landscape trembles as though taking a slow, hopeful breath. Suddenly the tree multiplies—one, two, ten, a hundred—until an entire orchard radiates around you. The dunes crumble into fertile loam, rich and fragrant. Streams of honeyed water carve themselves into existence, threading between roots, whispering new melodies of “plenty-plenty-plenty.”

You bite into a pomegranate. The seeds burst, tasting like sunrise and stardust. With every swallow, something loosens in your chest. Numbers drop away. Scarcity dissolves like sugar in warm tea.

A doorway carved of moonlight opens in midair. Passing through, you find yourself atop a colossal library staircase. Shelves stretch beyond sight, not orderly and austere but lush and abundant—books sprout like wildflowers, pages fluttering, each spine a different hue. Titles glow: “Days of Unfettered Joy,” “Courage in Quiet Moments,” “Worlds Yet Unimagined.” You realize these are volumes you’ve never dared to write, read, or live.

A gentle librarian—eyes like liquid copper, hair braided with constellations—smiles knowingly. She places in your hands an empty journal with a cover that changes colors depending on your breath. “Fill this,” she says, “but never with the fear of running out. Ink is infinite here.” You flip the blank pages; they hum like violin strings waiting for a bow.

Descending the staircase, you enter a bazaar under kaleidoscopic lanterns. Tables overflow with ripe dragon fruit, marzipan swans, spools of shimmering silk, vials of curiosity labeled “Open for Serendipity.” Merchants laugh, their pockets jingling not with coins but with seeds that sprout into flowers whenever traded. You have nothing to barter—or so you think—until you remember your pockets full of old scarcity ledgers. You hand one over. A vendor sprinkles it with star-dust; it sprouts into a bouquet of phoenix feathers. Gasps of delight ripple through the bazaar. The crowd starts offering you trinkets—time-in-bottles, empathy stones, compass roses that point toward wonder—simply for the promise of your next transformed ledger. You see: value is not in hoarding, but in alchemizing.

When twilight kisses the stalls, you discover a mirror framed by vines of glowing jasmine. Your reflection is draped in gilded fabrics, eyes luminescent with possibility. Yet the mirror does not hold you captive; instead, it swings open like a gateway. On the other side, an ocean of liquid silver laps at a shore paved with scallop shells. Each wave delivers softly spoken assurances: “There will be enough. You are enough.”

You step onto the surface of the water—it supports you like a memory—and you begin to dance, every footfall sending spirals of light across the horizon. Dolphins woven from constellations leap around you, and the sky blooms with fireworks of bioluminescent plankton, spelling out a single word: ABUNDANCE.

A final surge of silver surf wraps around your waist like a sash, gently pushing you toward waking. As the dream’s colors fade, you clutch the journal against your heart. It follows you into consciousness, its pages still blank, its cover still shifting hues. And in the quiet morning air, you hear the lingering echo of the bazaar’s laughter and the orchard’s rustling leaves, reminding you that scarcity was only ever a mirage in a desert that was ready to bloom.
