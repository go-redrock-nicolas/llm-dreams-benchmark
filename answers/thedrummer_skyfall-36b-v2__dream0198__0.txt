I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a vast, pulsating control room, my hands dancing over a bewildering array of flickering consoles and blinking lights. The air is thick with tension and the acrid tang of ozone, a low hum of emergency power generators providing the only comfort in the sprawling space.

Suddenly, alarm klaxons pierce the suffocating atmosphere, strident and insistent. Consoles erupt into a chaotic flurry of beeping, flashing red and signalling system overloaded. Thick, rivulets of smoke ooze from cracked heads. The large holo-screen at the center of the room flickers erratically before settling on an ominous red warning: CRITICAL SYSTEMS FAILURE IMMINENT. 

With a queer feeling of falling, I realize I am behind enemy lines in a distant, embattled system on a planet in the throes of civil war. This control center is the last bastion against aiks lead onslaught. The fate of millions of lives rests on my shoulders. 

"Mac, I need an update!" I shout into my comm-unit, struggling to calm the rising tide of panic within me.

Static crackles back, shot through with cutting oaths and shouted orders. " primeras inspiring curring! We can't reboot the reactors!" comes Mac's rebuttal, heartbreaking. Hushed tones, sounds of metal tearing, the cat√©goric 'thunka-thunka' of heavy artillery. 

Overhead displays show red arrows streaming across the map, troops mobilizing in alarm. But for every mark of resistance, two more systems are flashing red, an inky tide creeping across the charts. The enemy is sheltering in densely packed civilian strongholds, using innocents as living shields.

AIDS targets for the airstrike, voices urging me to "get them" and "beat the bastards" in the distance, desperation and bloodlust warped into nonsensical buzzwords. I hesitate, weighing lives against lives, knowing the time will soon be again...

The console before me flashes, an urgent priority message from the general supplied by the UN. It simply reads: "Make the hard choice. It must be done."

Pressure builds in my skull like a ripping ship, conflicting voices whirl around me. I am drowning in the impossible, in the moral knots that choke me each night as I struggle to find sleep.

Sweat pours down my face in this nightmare, my clothes drenched with it, breath catching in my throat. Consoles shriek at me, Mac's voice drowns under the wailing sirens, and the lights begin to dim, a hissing crackle signaling a power shutdown.

"Mac!" I shout into the comm. "I need an ETA on that reboot!"

But only silence replies, a dead line dropping away as the lights fade to black.
