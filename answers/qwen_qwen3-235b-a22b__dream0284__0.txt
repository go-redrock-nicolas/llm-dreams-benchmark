I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, endless corridor made of glass—glass that reflects not my image, but a thousand versions of me, each caught in a different moment of fear. One stares blankly into nothingness, another paces in circles, whispering reassurances no one hears. The floor beneath my feet is slick and shimmering, wavering between ice and liquid mercury, so that each step feels like falling forward into silence.

The dream pulses with the hum of faraway voices, indistinct but judgmental. They swell and recede like ocean tides, but within my chest I can hear my heartbeat: loud, stuttering, a stuttering butterfly trapped between my ribs. The anxiety is palpable, an invisible fog seeping into my bones, cooling my skin, thickening the air.

I am running towards something I cannot see. The corridor bends without end, folding in on itself, reflecting and refracting the chaos of my mind. I know—without knowing—that the event is close. A gathering. A room full of people I do not know, and do not wish to know. They shimmer in my mind like ghosts, faceless but familiar, as if I've dreamt them before in other dreams, background characters in someone else’s story.

Suddenly, I break through into a vast ballroom, ancient and opalescent with age. The ceiling is high, domed, painted with constellations that move slowly, like live stars above—and beneath my feet, the floor is a mirror of the sky. I see my reflection below, small and trembling. Chandeliers made of actual moonlight dangle precariously overhead, trailing with threads of silver that chime with no wind at all. The guests are there—but they don’t speak. They only watch me with blank, porcelain masks, each one a different color: emerald, onyx, gold like rusted blood.

I cannot escape them. Every time I try to turn back, the door vanishes behind me, and there is only onward. Conversations swirl like smoke and I cannot find the words to speak, no matter how I form them in my mouth. My tongue is too heavy, my breath catches somewhere deep in my throat, and when I open my mouth to greet them, all that comes forth is soundless motion, like a silent film.

The crowd melts into a forest—just like that. One moment, I'm in the ballroom, the next, I’m surrounded by trees whose roots rise like cathedral arches. Their bark glows faintly with bioluminescent veins, pulsing with a frequency too low to hear but I can feel it through the soles of my shoes, which are now bare.

They follow me—those masked figures—but now they are shadows with long limbs, gliding noiselessly between the trees. And still I am wet with nerves. My stomach twists, catches fire, grows icy. This is not a place of peace, but of judgment. And I am being judged not by what I've done, but by what I've not dared.

At the heart of the forest, there is a door carved directly into the trunk of a tree so vast it must be alive. I know instinctively that beyond it lies the truth of the gathering I've feared. But when I reach for the glowing handle, the forest grows still—not peaceful, but listening. The anxiety sharpens to a blade’s edge.

I wake then—gasping into the dim light of my room—but something of the dream flickers behind my eyes, refusing to fade. A truth still ripples beneath the surface of that strange gathering, unresolved, calling me back.

Perhaps we are always reaching toward the next event, the next test of our presence and personhood. And in dreams, we face them invisible, naked, yet unforgettable.
