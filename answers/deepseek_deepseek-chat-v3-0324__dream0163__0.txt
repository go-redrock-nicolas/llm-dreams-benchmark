I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric murmur as I stand at the threshold of an impossible library. The walls stretch endlessly into the void—ribbons of living parchment spiraling upward, their edges flickering like candle flames. The problem weighs on me like a stone, intricate and unyielding, whispering across generations in the language of riddles. The experts before me had tried logic, reason, brute force. But here, in this place, the rules rewrite themselves.  

A voice—half wind, half thought—coaxes me deeper. *"The answer lies where the answers aren’t."*  

I reach for a book bound in liquid mercury, and the moment my fingers brush its surface, it dissolves into a swarm of silver moths. They scatter, fluttering toward a fissure in the air where reality puckers like torn fabric. Beyond it, the world is inverted: rivers climb skyward, trees spiral inward like nautilus shells, and time drips like honey from fractured hourglasses.  

A figure sits at the center—an androgynous being woven from shifting fractals, solving puzzles by un-solving them. They press a hand against the void, and suddenly I understand: the solution isn’t something to be built, but something to be *undone*. The problem itself is an illusion, a knot tightened by presumption. What if, instead of seeking more knowledge, we erase the question?  

I wake gasping—not with an answer, but with the electrifying echo of an idea too vast to name. The dream lingers like twilight, whispering secrets in the language of shadows. For the first time, the impossible feels malleable.
