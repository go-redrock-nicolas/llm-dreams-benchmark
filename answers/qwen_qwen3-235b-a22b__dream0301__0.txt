I am dreaming. 

The sky is not sky anymore but a great yawning mouth of twilight, a swirling tangerine-cobalt haze that drips liquid possibility onto the trembling earth below. I am standing on the edge of a cliff, but the ground is soft, pulsing like the lid of a closed eye. Behind me, a clock ticks—not in seconds, but in heartbeats. One heartbeat: *tick*; one breath: *tock*. It's counting down, but not to a time—I know now it is counting what remains of me.

You’ve postponed the thing that matters most. It lies within me, hidden in the silent language of dreams. Not a task, but a truth. Not a deadline, but a descent.

You feel it now, don’t you?

There is a path unfurling beneath my bare feet like a scroll of unremembered memories. The air smells of burnt lavender and forgotten names. I begin to walk, and the world shapeshifts around me—each step pulling the landscape taut like a curtain drawn across a terrifyingly familiar stage.

A labyrinth materializes before me. Its walls are built of paper-thin regrets folded into razor-thin origami. They shimmer with hues of every excuse I’ve ever whispered to myself. Some flicker with the image of unfinished letters, wilted dreams, ambitions folded like abandoned boats. As I pass through them, I hear my own voice echo back—lazy, scared, unable to start. Each word sharper than it should be.

In the center of the labyrinth is a door that isn't a door but a mirror, cracked from center to soul. Reflected within is not me, but *what* I could have been if I had stopped waiting for the right time, the perfect moment, the clear sky. I reach out instinctively. My reflection does not mimic me; it surges forward, clawing at my chest, fingers of smoke and memory dragging me inside.

Now I fall—although falling doesn’t name what this is.

It is falling into the center of everything I've avoided—the cold tight space of vulnerability and consequence. I'm swallowed by a great and weightless dark that snores like ageless sleep. In here, time shrivels into a spiral, and all unfinished things come to roost in the bones of the procrastinator.

I see the task again—no longer abstract, not merely paperwork or outline or proposal—but a living thing made of my own light. I left it alone to wither in silence, believing I had more room for delay. Now it’s skeletal, yet still breathing.

It curls inward, whimpering like a wounded star.

And in this dream-space soaked in celestial regret, I finally do what I’ve always avoided. I sit before it. I open my chest and pour out the viscera of my excuses until only raw resolve remains. I begin.

Not in grand applause, nor in triumphant light, but in the quiet dignity of having waited just long enough to understand. That perhaps the drop-off toward consequence is not meant to scare us—but to push us into a deeper part of ourselves we would’ve never touched if the ground beneath hadn’t started slipping.

And the dream fades… not because the ending is known, but because I have already woken inside it—

And have finally begun.
