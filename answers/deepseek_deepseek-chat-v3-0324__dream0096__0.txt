I am dreaming. **[Dream Sequence: The Glass Labyrinth]**  

I am dreaming.  

At first, there is only darkness—velvet and infinite, like the space between stars. Then, a slow pulse of light, flickering in the distance. It swells, and suddenly I am standing in a labyrinth of glass. Walls rise seamless and crystalline, stretching into a sky bleached of color. My breath fogs the air, sharp and quick, but no sound escapes. Only silence, thick as snowfall.  

I turn—my reflection splinters into a thousand versions of myself, each slightly distorted. But something is wrong. Behind me, in the glass, my shadow moves *on its own.* It peels away from my feet, rising like smoke, forming into a silhouette with hollow eyes.  

A whisper like dry leaves: *"You can’t outrun me."*  

My heartbeat is a drum, frantic, rattling my ribs. I run—the walls shift, maze tightening like a vise. The glass begins to *melt*, dripping slow and syrupy, forming shapes—hands, faces, my own terrified expression repeated endlessly. The ground beneath me turns liquid, swallowing my steps.  

Then, the cold realization: my greatest fear isn’t the shadow, or the maze. It’s the *certainty* taking root in my gut—that I am alone here. Truly. Irrevocably. No one will come, no one will hear me scream—  

A hand bursts through the glass.  

Fingers slick with light grab my wrist and *pull.*
