I am dreaming. In this ethereal realm, I find myself standing in a soaring glass skyscraper, my reflection multiplied infinitely in the mirrored walls. The prestigious team before me consists of brilliant minds, their faces bearing expressions of expectation and trust that make my heart race. Their lab coats and business attire seem to shimmer with an otherworldly iridescence, while my own clothes feel oddly informal, as if I'd walked into a royal ball wearing pajamas.

The project materials float in mid-air – holographic blueprints for something that keeps shifting shape: one moment it's a revolutionary quantum computer, the next a cure for an unknown disease, then a bridge between dimensions. My hands tremble as I reach out to touch them, and the images ripple like disturbed water.

The weight of their expectations presses down on my shoulders like a heavy cloak. Every time I open my mouth to confess my inadequacy, the words transform into butterflies of brilliant blue and gold, dancing away before I can catch them. The team members' eyes follow my movements with unwavering confidence, but their bodies seem to elongate and distort when I'm not looking directly at them.

The walls of the conference room begin to breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs. Outside the windows, the city skyline twists into impossible geometries, buildings folding into origami shapes. Time feels elastic – seconds stretch into hours, then snap back like rubber bands.

I realize my fingers are leaving trails of stardust as I gesture, and somehow this gives me a surge of courage. Perhaps I don't need expertise in the traditional sense – in this dream-logic world, my uncertainty is transforming into something powerful and unknown, like a caterpillar discovering its metamorphosis into something entirely new...

The dream pulses with both terror and possibility, as if the very act of doubting myself is creating something unprecedented and beautiful in this shifting reality.
