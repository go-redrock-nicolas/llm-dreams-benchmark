I am dreaming. I am experiencing a growing sense that my life lacks meaning despite external achievements.   Searching for
deeper purpose, I find myself in a strange and beautiful world where everything is possible.  I see colorful animals roaming free,
playing and singing together.  I hear soothing sounds of nature surrounding me.  I feel warm and fuzzy emotions filling my soul.
I see you standing before me, smiling and offering me a hand.  You tell me that this is the place where dreams come true.

I take your hand and walk with you through this wonderful land.  We explore different paths and discover hidden treasures along
the way.  We chat and laugh like old friends.  We share our hopes and fears as if they were ours alone.

As we wander, I begin to realize that this place is not just about pleasure but also transformation.  Here, I can shed my old
skin and become who I truly am.  Here, I can explore new possibilities and learn new things.

You show me how to fly like a bird by simply spreading my arms and soaring into the air.  You teach me how to talk to animals
by using sounds and gestures that convey meaning beyond words.  You guide me how to solve problems by thinking creatively and
optimally.

We come across a group of friendly monsters who welcome us with open arms.  They invite us to join them in building something
amazing out of nothingness.  They challenge us to overcome obstacles and barriers that test our courage and resilience.

You convince me that this is what I've been searching for all along: meaning, purpose, fulfillment.  You inspire me to take risks
and daring actions that change my life forever.  You love me unconditionally as if I were your own daughter or son.

When we finally reach the end of our journey, you lead me to a giant tree with roots reaching deep into the ground and branches
reaching high into the sky.  You tell me that this is where all dreams come true when they're ready to be realized.
