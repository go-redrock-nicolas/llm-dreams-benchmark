I am dreaming. You find yourself increasingly disconnected from old friends as your life paths diverge. Sensing this gradual social drift, you decide to initiate a dream gathering to reconnect with them. You envision an enormous tree in the center of a field with branches big enough for everyone to sit on. You send each friend an invitation to join you under the tree at midnight, when the dream world is most vivid and realistic. They all accept except for one who's out of town during this time frame.

The day arrives and you eagerly anticipate seeing your friends again after so long apart. As midnight approaches, you prepare yourself mentally and physically by meditating and visualizing the dream tree. When it's midnight exactly, you fall asleep without any external assistance or devices like smartphones etc.

You wake up in the dream world near a small town surrounded by rolling hills dotted with colorful wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze. You follow your senses towards an intoxicating scent of jasmine leading you deeper into the countryside until finally, there it is! The tree from your dream invitation standing tall before you in all its glory!

You climb up onto one of its lower branches and see some familiar faces nearby but many empty ones too... You wonder where everyone else is... Maybe they didn't receive the invitation or forgot about it or had other plans or got lost trying to find the tree or maybe something else entirely...
