I am dreaming. I find myself in a world that feels both alien and familiar, a place of shadowed valleys and mountains that scrape the sky. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet tang of wildflowers, yet there’s an eerie silence that makes every sound—the creak of a branch, the rustle of leaves—linger unnervingly in the stillness. The light is strange here: golden, yes, but tinged with an unnatural, almost sickly green that shifts and pulses like the heartbeat of some vast, slumbering beast. 

I feel a pull, deep in my chest, like a string tugging me toward something. It’s a physical sensation, almost painful, and it grows stronger the further I walk. The path is unclear; the terrain shifts underfoot, soft earth giving way to sharp rocks, then back again. The landscape itself seems to resist my passage, as though it’s alive and aware of my presence. But still, I press on. 

Ahead, nestled between two jagged peaks, I see it: a small, perfect meadow. It glows faintly, as though lit from within. There’s something about it that calls to me, something ancient and impossible to ignore. I can’t see what’s at the center of the meadow—it’s shrouded by a faint mist—but I know, with absolute certainty, that I must reach it. The compulsion feels like a force of nature, like gravity or the pull of the tides. 

The closer I get, the more the air around me seems to hum. The ground grows warmer beneath my feet, and the mist thickens, swirling around me like tendrils of smoke. It’s not just the air that’s alive—everything in this place feels sentient. The trees rustle as if whispering to one another, and I can’t shake the feeling that they’re talking about me. 

Finally, I step into the meadow, and everything stops. The air goes still, and the mist parts like a curtain. In the center of the clearing lies a figure, impossibly still. It’s not a person, exactly—but also not not a person. It’s formless and shifting, a patch of fog that swells and contracts, and somehow, I recognize it. This is the thing I’ve been seeking, the thing I couldn’t name but have been drawn to my whole life. 

I kneel beside it, hesitant, unsure. At my touch, the fog solidifies, taking on a shape: a mirror. The surface is foggy, hazy, and as I peer into it, my reflection isn’t there. Instead, I see a world—my world, but different. The sky is brighter, the colors more vivid. People I’ve known—family, friends—move through it, but their expressions are peaceful. They’re happy. And then, in the reflective pool of the mirror, I see myself. But it isn’t me. It’s someone stronger, wiser, more complete. Someone I could be, if only I had the courage to pursue those impractical, unwise desires others warned me against. 

The realization hits me with the force of a wave. I understand, at last, what I’ve been looking for. It’s not a place or a person, not even a thing. It’s a choice. A choice to embrace that impractical, foolish desire—to follow the path that feels more like destiny than decision. 

As I stand, the meadow begins to fade, the mist closing back in. The trees start whispering again, and the air hums. But this time, the sound is different. It feels like an affirmation, like the whole universe is rooting for me. 

I wake up with a start, the dream still vivid in my mind. I can’t shake the feeling that something important has changed inside me, that the dream wasn’t just a fantasy, but a message—a call to action. As I lie there, the light of dawn creeping through my window, I make a decision. I don’t know what it will lead to, or what it will cost, but I know one thing: I will follow that desire. No matter how impractical or unwise it may seem. 

Because what’s the point of living if you never take a chance on what you truly want?
