I am dreaming. …step across an invisible threshold, and the moment you do, the dreamscape around you shivers, rearranging itself the way a kaleidoscope spills new patterns when you twist the barrel.

You stand at the mouth of a dusky canyon whose walls glow with slow-moving constellations, as though the night sky has melted downward and coated every jagged ridge. Somewhere far inside, a rhythmic pulse—part heartbeat, part drum—echoes like a call to adventure. You recognize it as the place where every risk you have ever avoided waits for its reckoning.

Wind brushes your cheeks with the chill of uncertainty. Instinct urges you to retreat to the meadow of soft grasses behind you, the safe ground you know far too well. But tonight the air itself whispers: “What happens if you stay?” 

So you gather your courage like a cloak and step forward.

Each footfall lights a rune beneath your boot—a brief flare of turquoise that hums with potential. The runes illuminate carvings on the canyon walls: unfinished sculptures, outlines of heroic versions of yourself mid-stride, mid-leap, mid-transformation. They are frozen possibilities, still waiting for the spark of lived experience to bring them fully into being.

The canyon narrows, forcing you to squeeze through a gap barely wider than your shoulders. Limestone scrapes your skin; sparks of discomfort flicker, urging retreat. You press on, and the passage opens into a cavern that swirls with warm, amber mist. Suspended in the center is an enormous cocoon spun from silver thread and shards of mirror. It throbs gently, as though sensing your presence.

A voice—your own, yet older, wiser, resonant—drifts from the cocoon: “Growth is forged where friction meets desire.”

You feel the tug of countless memories: the presentation you never volunteered for, the relationship you never mended, the language you set aside because rolling unfamiliar sounds across your tongue felt foolish. They materialize as translucent moths circling the cocoon, fluttering with unrealized energy.

Challenging the urge to turn away, you extend your hand toward the cocoon’s shimmering surface. It ripples like liquid glass, and an opening unfurls. Inside, darkness beckons—velvety, silent, and unknown. Your pulse races, but curiosity swells stronger.

You crawl through.

Instantly you’re submerged in weightless ink. Panic sparks. Yet when you surrender and allow yourself to float, thin ribbons of violet light coil around your limbs, guiding you onward. Every ribbon is a promise: If you lean in—just a breath farther—you’ll surface in a place no shrinking comfort ever could carry you.

Then, a sensation like dawn pressing against closed eyelids: warmth, radiance, possibility. You break through a membrane of shadow and find yourself standing on a glassy plateau high above clouds the color of rose petals. Here, the air tastes of rain and citrus, thrillingly new. In the near distance sits a long oak table carved with swirling sigils. At each seat waits one of your potential selves:

• The storyteller whose voice never quavered.
• The advocate who speaks even when the room falls silent.
• The traveler fluent in the dialects of strangers.
• The master of a craft you’ve never yet tried.

They look up as you approach—no judgment, only welcome. One raises a goblet of starlight and invites you to sit. The chair beneath you feels alive, adjusting to your spine, ready to support weight you once thought unbearable.

When you take the goblet, starlight spills down your wrist—you’re trembling, but it is the tremor of ignition, not fear. You drink, and the taste is impossible: hot cinnamon, cold ocean spray, sweet basil, bittersweet farewells, exhilarating hellos—every flavor you denied yourself by hiding in the comfortable and familiar.

A gong reverberates across the plateau. The table and the sky rotate together, slow as planets, revealing an amphitheater of empty seats carved in crystal. Above them hangs an unfinished constellation shaped like a question mark. At the center, a missing star blinks insistently.

You understand: that star is a marker for the deed you still must do at the edge of waking life—the phone call, the class registration, the apology, the leap. Place it, and the constellation becomes a compass for every next step.

Suddenly, the plateau tilts, sliding you toward a swirl of luminous fog. You fall laughing, unafraid, gravity now an ally pulling you toward daylight. As you plunge, the sky shouts in a chorus of voices—your voices—“Remember the canyon, remember the cocoon, remember the taste of starlight.” 

The fog forms a tunnel and at its end you glimpse your actual bedroom door glowing like sunrise behind wood grain. Your sleeping body stirs, preparing to wake, but the dream leaves you with a final gift: a tiny ember in the palm of your hand. It flickers, waiting for you to decide which untraveled path you’ll feed it to first.

And just before your eyelids crack open, you whisper to yourself, “Comfort is a lullaby, but courage is an anthem. Today, I choose the anthem.”
