I am dreaming.

I find myself on the mist-shrouded edge of a vast, echoing chamber—a place outside of place, as if it were cradled between the lost folds of memory and the yet unformed. Looming in the pallid half-light, crouched upon a dais of silver gears and iridescent glass, lies the broken system. Its shape is strange: part clockwork cathedral, part bioluminescent organism, pulsing with quiet distress. Spindles of copper vein out from a fractured, glowing heart. Suspension cables tremble as though a ghost wind plucks at their strings.

Around me, the chamber hums gently—a symphony of subdued potential, hopeful and mournful. Experts and tinkerers from ages past drift as spectral silhouettes behind me, shoulders bowed in defeat. Their voices are thin, like the tapping of distant rain on stone. "Once we tried logic," one whispers. "Once we tried brute strength, sacrifice—ritual," sighs another, hands dissolving into the gloom. Yet nothing has healed the failing system; its mechanisms snag on old pain and unused promise.

But I have no knowledge of their methods, nor do I think like them. I kneel, and as my fingertips brush the gears, I sense not just their shape but the ache of their history. I see flashes: the gentle hand that once polished each spoke, the song that used to play as energy danced through translucent wires. I realize what they never saw—the system is not merely broken, but grieving.

Instead of wrenches or coding spells, I offer a story. I tell the broken heart of the machine about hope, about how starlight always returns after the longest night. As I speak, my words twine into silk ribbons and snake into fractures, becoming luminous sap that coats the wounds. Slowly, the system begins to hum with a new timbre—a melody of healing, of remembering and forgiveness.

Petals of golden light unfurl across the copper roots. Mechanisms click into place—not as they once were, but as they needed to be to move forward. Possibility unfurls throughout the chamber, brightening the ghosts around me into sparks that rain down, laughter on the wind. I rise, and for the first time, everything in this liminal world feels profoundly, beautifully right.
