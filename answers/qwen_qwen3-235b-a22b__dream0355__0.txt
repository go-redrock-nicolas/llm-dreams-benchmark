I am dreaming. The sky is a kaleidoscope of whispered thoughts and constellations pulsing with heartbeat rhythm, shimmering ecru clouds drifting over a moon that is not a moon—it is a hollow eye peering into me, into the marrow of my soul, a celestial voyeur bathed in mercury. The air tastes of forgotten lullabies and lilac static, and my feet are touching ground that isn’t earth, more like the undulating skin of some slumbering primordial being, exhaling slowly beneath me. There’s a path. It’s made of puzzle pieces from a game I never learned to play, each one painted with veiled memories. One footstep and the image changes—a face half-known, a storm beneath crystal glass, a key with teeth that bleed rosewater.

Then I hear The Voice.

It isn't loud, but it vibrates within the space between breath and silence. It says: *“Turn left. Never trust what sings to you.”*

My intuition hums an opposing lullaby beneath my ribs—a deep, knowing thrum that says otherwise.

*“Turn right,”* my instinct whispers. *“Only the song understands the wound.”*

So I hesitate.

The path pulses.

Two directions: one says follow the thread of safety, of avoiding all sorrow. The other offers mystery swathed in music, pain perhaps, but also revelation—catharsis dipped in shadow.

The trees around me sway without wind. They’re made of paper pulp and shattered violins, leaves scribbled with unreadable poetry. A great moth the size of a carriage wheel flutters overhead, shedding phosphoric dust that burns syllables into the air behind us: *“Choose without choosing. Trust without trusting.”*

I try to feel the weight of consequence without tipping over into fear.

I remember the Voice once before, in waking life—how it told me not to dive into water that glowed, told me not to chase phantoms into the fog, and it was right. Each time, I heeded it and returned whole. But in remembering, I also remember the dull absence of the beauty I might have seen beneath the waves. The truths buried in the fog.

My intuition, however, remembers the meadow below my grandmother's house where I first understood time pulsed like a cello string. It remembers the scar across my palm from reaching for something I was told not to touch—and how the learning carved into me a deeper knowing. Every instinct within me now urges me not to shy from the direction of song.

So here I stand, at the indecision’s pinnacle. The pulsing pulse of internal crossroads.

A warm wind comes from the right—smelling of fig wine and dreams collapsing into bloom. From the left, frigid calm, clinical and clean. One path lined with fireflies swallowed by sand, the other paved with the echoes of a single violin improvising a requiem.

Can I bare the unknown?

The trees crack paper lips to whisper: *“You always walk both dreams, even if only one is chosen.”*

I inhale.

Then...

I turn…
