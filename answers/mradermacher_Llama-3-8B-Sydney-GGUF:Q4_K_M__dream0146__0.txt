I am dreaming. I'm caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire with no clear escape route. As smoke thickens and flames approach from multiple directions, I feel panic rising within me. My heart pounds furiously against my rib cage. My lungs constrict painfully around my chest cavity. My skin prickles with fear as sweat beads on my forehead.
I run blindly through the forest, leaping over fallen logs and dodging low-hanging branches. I hear crackling sounds behind me, getting closer and louder by the second. I scream hysterically into the air, hoping someone will hear me and rescue me.
But no one comes.

I trip and fall face-first onto the ground. Pain radiates from my nose and mouth as I scrape against rugged terrain. I curl up into a ball, protecting my vulnerable stomach and organs. I close my eyes tightly, willing myself to disappear.
Then I see her.

A ghostly figure appears out of nowhere, floating gracefully above me like an angel. She wears a white gown with flowing sleeves and trains, reminiscent of ancient Greek or Roman deities. Her face is hidden by a veil, but I sense her gentle presence and warm aura.
She extends her hand toward me, inviting me to follow her. I hesitate for a moment, unsure if I should trust her. But my instinct tells me she means no harm.

I stand up and walk with her through the burning forest, leaving behind the charred remains of trees and plants. We head towards a mysterious opening in the distance, illuminated by a bright light shining from within.
As we draw closer, I realize it's not an opening at allâ€”it's actually a huge hole dug into the earth, leading down to an underground cave system.
