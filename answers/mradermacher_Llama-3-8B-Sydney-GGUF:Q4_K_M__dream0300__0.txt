I am dreaming. I find myself drawn to an activity with an element of physical danger that both frightens and excites me.  As adrenaline courses through my body, I feel alive and powerful.  

I am standing on the edge of a cliff, overlooking a vast valley below.  The air is crisp and cold, and the sun is shining brightly in the sky.  I can hear the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of leaves in the wind.  I can see the greenery of trees and plants, and the blueish color of water ponds and streams.

I know that once I jump off this cliff, there will be no turning back.  I will fall freely into the air, gravity pulling me down towards the ground.  I will crash against rocks and branches, and suffer injuries that may even kill me.

But I also know that once I reach the bottom of this valley, there will be so much to explore and discover.  There will be hidden caves and tunnels, ancient ruins and artifacts, mysterious creatures and spirits.

I take a deep breath, and feel my lungs expand with oxygen.  I close my eyes for a moment, and imagine what it would feel like to fly through the air like an eagle.  

Then I open my eyes again, and look down at the ground below me.  I see a small patch of soil, covered with moss and lichen.  I see some wild flowers growing out of the earth, their petals spreading open in delight.

I realize that this is what I want.  This is what I need.  

This is why I am here, dreaming with you tonight.
