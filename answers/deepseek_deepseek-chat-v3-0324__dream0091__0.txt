I am dreaming. The walls pulse like living flesh around me, breathing in a slow, hypnotic rhythm that matches the frantic hammering of my heart. The air smells thick with anticipation—ozone and damp earth, like the charged moment before a storm breaks. My fingers tremble as I clutch the edges of my creation, its surface humming beneath my touch, alive with colors that shift when I blink—indigo bleeding into molten gold, then dissolving into whispers of silver.

The critics materialize from the shadows, their faces elongated and shifting—one moment human, the next avian, then carved from polished obsidian. Their eyes gleam, pupils contracting into thin slits as they lean forward in unison. I open my mouth, but instead of words, moths tumble out, their powdery wings brushing against my lips. The critics’ impassive expressions don’t waver. One lifts a skeletal hand and plucks a moth from the air, crushing it between ink-stained fingers. The sound is deafening—like the crack of a glacier splitting.  

I try to step back, but my feet have taken root, tendrils of ivy snaking up my calves. My creation pulses brighter in response, emitting a low, mournful note that vibrates through the marrow of my bones. The tallest critic tilts its head—too far, until its neck stretches like taffy—and opens a mouth full of whirring cogs. “Show us,” it demands, and the words echo inside my skull, rattling my teeth.  

With a final, shuddering breath, I unfurl my creation, watching as it blooms like a dying star. The critics’ reflections warp in its shimmering surface—their true forms revealed: jagged, hungry things with too many joints, too many teeth.  

And then—silence.  

The tallest critic reaches out, its fingers elongating as they skim the edges of my work. A single tear rolls down its obsidian cheek, sizzling as it hits the floor.  

“Ah,” it sighs, the sound like wind through hollow reeds. “Someone has finally dreamed *properly.*”
