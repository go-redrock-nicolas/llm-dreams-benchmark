I am dreaming. …and the numbers on your charts have begun to bleed together, smearing into crimson-violet inkblots that pulse like living jellyfish across the slide. Your throat tightens. A thousand eyes—some human, some unmistakably made of bronze and clockwork—stare down at you from the panel’s elevated dais. Their nameplates read like constellations: Dr. Lyra Octantis, Professor Rigel Castor, Archivist Perseus Meridian. The air vibrates with a faint, harmonic humming—almost as though the auditorium itself is alive and expectant.

You glance again at your notes. Bullet points have wriggled free and now coil around each other in serpentine knots. The thesis line, the crown jewel of your life’s work, has fractured into shimmering letters that flutter upward like startled moths. Panic flickers in your chest, yet you feel the peculiar lucidity of a dream—an awareness that everything might reshape if you simply breathe the right way.

So you inhale, deep and deliberate. The ceiling dissolves, revealing a swirling cosmos of indigo and molten gold. Stars drift downward, settling like soft snow on the audience’s shoulders. The experts do not flinch; instead, they lean in, hungry. You realize they are not here merely to judge. They are here to witness metamorphosis.

Your slides—now pure liquid color—spill off the screen and pool at your feet. You kneel, scoop the luminous ink into your palms, and smear it across the blank whiteboard behind you. Instantly an image blossoms: a towering tree whose leaves are shimmering equations, each formula fluttering and clinking like tiny wind chimes. Roots burrow deep, cracking the stage floor and plunging into unseen soil scented with rain and memory.

“There are errors,” you announce, voice echoing strangely through a canyon made of time. “But errors are portals.”

At that, every mistake you feared begins to sprout petals: typos unfurl into orchids; misaligned graphs twist into spiral galaxies. Even a catastrophic miscalculation forms a glass stairway that arcs up and over the panel’s heads, promising ascent.

Professor Rigel Castor taps an hourglass embedded in their chest, and sand spills outward, freezing midair in glittering suspension. “Show us,” they say, the timbre of their voice bending space. “Walk us through your proof by wonder.”

You step onto the newly formed stairway, each glass tread chiming beneath your feet. As you rise, the auditorium becomes a vast terrarium. Ferns with fractal fronds sprout from rows of velvet seats; bioluminescent moths orbit the chandeliers, scribbling cursive in light. Far below, the panelists scrutinize the unfolding spectacle—one scribbles observations with a quill of thunderbolt feathers; another adjusts a monocle shaped like a miniature eclipse.

At the apex of the stairway, you reach an ornate door made of overlapping Rorschach patterns. It opens at a touch, revealing a circular chamber where your life’s work—every hypothesis, every failed draft—drifts as translucent ribbons in zero gravity. They weave themselves around you, cocooning you in a swirling tapestry of data and desire. The errors glow hottest, acting as fiery nodes knitting disparate strands together.

A sudden hush. The tapestry compresses, then pops outward like a supernova, forming a single crystalline sphere: perfect, prismatic, singing with harmonics drawn from your deepest intentions. It hovers between you and the panelists. Silence stretches, vibrating with consequence.

Archivist Perseus Meridian stands, voice soft as parchment turning. “What is its name?”

You feel the answer ripening on your tongue—a word that tastes of midnight rain and sunrise honey. You speak it, and the sphere dissolves into a comet of multicolored pollen that rains over everyone, seed by microscopic seed. Wherever the pollen lands, it germinates knowledge: the audience holds up their hands to catch blooming insights; the panelists’ eyes blaze with recognition.

The auditorium dims, then brightens into dawn. The great tree behind you exhales a breeze that smells like pages of future textbooks. A verdict looms, but your pulse is calm—the dream has alchemized terror into awe.

Dr. Lyra Octantis rises, spreading clockwork wings that flick open with the soft click of inevitability. “We see the errors,” she says, “and we see what you made of them. Your life’s work is not a monument; it is an evolving star.”

And with that proclamation, applause erupts—not the brittle clatter of hands, but a thunderous bloom of music. Violins of pure light, drums of subterranean stone. The sound lifts you, weightless, until you hover above the stage like a new moon.

You wake—or perhaps you don’t. In your fist you clutch a single shimmering letter from that word you spoke, still warm, still pulsing. As the real-world ceiling snaps back into view, you hear the echo of a thousand mechanical wings whispering: “Portal, portal, portal.”
