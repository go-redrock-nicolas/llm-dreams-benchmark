I am dreaming. You drift into the dream on a tide of humming violet light. At first you think you stand on a vast plain of glass, each step ringing like a bell; but as you move, the ground pulses beneath your feet, and each note that rings out blossoms into a flower of shimmering crystal. Overhead, two suns arc in slow-motion across a copper sky, casting long, oscillating shadows on the horizon. The air tastes of warm rain and burnt parchment.

Drawn by a low, resonant hum, you follow the sound to an immense library carved from opalescent rock. Its walls are formed by countless books whose spines ripple like living fish. You reach for one tome, and its cover melts beneath your fingers, dissolving into thousands of glowing words that hover in mid-air. They rearrange themselves into a single phrase: “The Moon Carrier is the Mother of Memory.” You recall how firmly you’d always believed that the moon was simply a cold, inert rock circling the Earth. That belief felt to you like a universal, unshakable truth.

But here in this crystalline hall, the letters swirl into other shapes. They reform as: “In our land, she is a weaver of dreams,” and then as: “To my people, she is a wandering child of the sky.” Each version pulses with equal clarity and conviction. In the shifting luminescence, you sense the bones of your old certainty crumble away, revealing the hidden scaffolding of culture and language beneath it. The moon you once held as objective is revealed as a story told in many tongues.

As realization blooms inside you, the library dissolves into a liquid horizon of stars. You float weightless, feeling your mind expand outward—no longer shackled to a single narrative. You perceive the world as a mosaic of perspectives, each as valid, each a facet of a greater whole. In this moment of pure kaleidoscopic insight, you understand that truth is not one fixed monument but a living tapestry woven by countless hands. You awaken—or so you think—and carry the dream’s luminosity into your waking heart, forever changed by the knowledge that what you once held as absolute was merely one voice among many.
