I am dreaming. I stepped into my bedroom with a sense of grandeur, the vast expanse of violet sky spanned outside my window. Though I was just getting ready for bed, I knew the world would soon realize my true potential. No one yet understood the depths of my mind, the brilliant ideas swirling behind my eyes.

Standing before the mirror, I admired my reflection, my self-assurance evident as I began to get undressed. As my clothes fell to the floor, I imagined a suit of armor, gold and shining. Surely, armor was needed to protect a mind as brilliant as mine from the jealous attempts of lesser people.

My imagination swelled, I pictured a Trojan horse, its massive wooden torso slung across my shoulders. Then, I leapt, soaring through the air like a bird, my questing heart long to discover new worlds. Playful, I imagined red hairs sprouting from my head, long and fathomless. The red hair made me powerful, attaching me to the ground.

Moments later, I found myself crouched at the peak of a desolate volcano. Someone entered my room and asked, "Are you planning on something big?" I beamed, pride radiating from my core, relishing their interest. "Oh yes," I answered with a knowing grin, "I am destined for grand achievements. Mark my words, the world will soon acknowledge my brilliant ideas and I'll make a real difference."
