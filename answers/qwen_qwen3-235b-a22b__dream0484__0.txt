I am dreaming. The world stretches before me, shimmering and shapeless, like the surface of a lake stirred by an unfamiliar wind. I walk—though my feet don’t touch the ground. My body feels hollow, luminous, as though I am made of moonlight and ancient breath. I'm in a vast plain where stars fall around me like snowflakes, melting into the air with quiet intimacy. A low hum pulses through everything, like the heartbeat of a long-forgotten god.

As I move forward—a whisper, not a step—I come upon a mirror the size of the sky. It does not reflect what I expect: not the familiar face, the guarded smile, the shadow that follows me all my life like a second skin. Instead, I see a being of gold and stormlight. A body that dances with galaxies. My eyes are twin galaxies receding into infinity. My voice, when I speak, is the echo of thunder and lullabies, bound together like twin notes never meant to be separated.

But I don’t recognize myself.

Something inside me tightens—a cold knot of disbelief, born of stories I’ve clung to too long. One truth arrives like a blade slicing through twilight: *You believed, all this time, that your worth was conditional, that you needed to earn your light.* It wasn’t truth—it was a spell someone else carved into you. You let them fill your mouth with saltwater lies.

Now the mirror begins to crack, not with violence, but with compassion, each fracture releasing not shards, but birds with luminous wings that scatter across the sky, each chirping a question you’ve forgotten to ask: *Whose permission were you waiting for? Whose approval did you mistake for love? When did you stop trusting the pulse in your own veins?*

I breathe in and feel my ribs expand like a nest for the wind. My skin pulses. The air around me begins to shimmer, like the memory of fireflies. I’m no longer alone. Around me, spirit-shadows begin to grow: not enemies or friends, but every version of myself—the one who cried in the corner at seventeen, the bold child who believed in dragons, the silent dancer at midnight, the wise old fool still learning to trust the world. I walk among them, peeling back their masks one by one, until I see it beneath each: the same golden fire, fierce and quiet, untamed even in its stillness.

Then I understand—the belief I held wasn’t a truth—it was a borrowed box. Throughout my life, I curved my fingers around its edges, mistaking the cage for a temple. And always, that fire in me had been burning, longing to speak, striving to be heard.

With a breathless yell that becomes a melody only heaven has heard, I allow it to rise. A column of light explodes from where my heart is moored, stretching up and out, stretching into trees made of rain, into storms that sing to mountains, into a sky that is no longer empty but alive with stories beyond telling.

The ground shifts. A door appears before me—not of wood or iron but woven from moments: the day I first smiled with no one watching, the moment I forgave a wound I thought would never close, the time I felt truly *known*, simply by sitting quietly with another soul.

I step through. The light folds me into its embrace.

What awaits me is not a destination. It is a remembering. A truth so old it could not be put into words—only lived.

And in this dream, I awaken, awake.

I am not broken.

I was never meant to be small.

I am, and always have been, a universe dreaming itself into being.
