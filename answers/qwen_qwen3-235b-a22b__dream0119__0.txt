I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers like liquid glass, and the sky above is a kaleidoscope of colors that defy names—swirls of indigo and molten gold bleeding into one another, as though the universe itself is painting with forgotten hues. Beneath your feet, the ground is soft, spongy, and faintly luminescent, like moss that glows in the shape of constellations. You breathe in, and the scent of burnt honey and ozone fills your lungs. This is no ordinary dream. This is a canvas, and you are the brush.  

You close your eyes and think of a creature—a being born not of flesh, but of the raw, untamed corners of your mind. You imagine a fox with feathers for fur, each strand iridescent and shifting like oil on water. Its eyes are twin eclipses, black holes ringed with fire, and its tail fans out into a plume of smoke that curls into shapes—a rose, a dagger, a weeping face. When you open your eyes, it’s there. It stands before you, impossibly real, its feather-fur rustling as though caught in a wind you cannot feel. It tilts its head, and you hear its voice in your thoughts: *“You made me. What shall I become?”*  

The power thrums in your veins. You describe another—a towering figure with a body of living coral, barnacles glinting like armor, and vines spiraling from its limbs like serpents. Its face is a shifting mosaic of faces you’ve loved and lost, flickering too fast to name. It hums a lullaby in a language that predates words, and the ground trembles with recognition. You laugh, giddy and terrified, because this is creation unbound by logic, a symphony of *what if*.  

But the dream shifts. The characters begin to move beyond your control. The feathered fox darts into the distance, leaving trails of smoke that coalesce into new shapes—a stormcloud shaped like a screaming child, a tree with roots that writhe like serpents. The coral giant kneels, plucking something from the glowing moss: a mirror. It holds it up, and you see not your reflection, but a version of yourself with hollow eyes and wings made of ash. *“You are not the only author here,”* it whispers, and the dream fractures.  

Suddenly, you’re in a city of floating staircases and upside-down rivers, where gravity is a suggestion. A woman with skin like molten bronze and hair of liquid shadow strides toward you, her voice a chorus of whispers. *“You opened the door,”* she says, and behind her, a thousand half-formed creatures writhe—beings stitched together from forgotten myths, their eyes hungry for purpose. Some are beautiful, others grotesque, but all pulse with the same desperate need: to exist, to *mean*.  

You try to speak, to command them, but the words stick in your throat. The dream is no longer yours alone. It’s a collaboration, a riot of voices clamoring to be heard. The feathered fox reappears, now riding a winged serpent with scales of stained glass, and they soar through a sky that rains light. The coral giant cradles the mirror-self, its mosaic face now frozen in sorrow. The bronze woman extends her hand, and in her palm blooms a flower made of ticking clockwork gears. *“Create,”* she urges, *“but choose wisely. Every story demands a sacrifice.”*  

You wake with a gasp, the taste of stardust and salt on your tongue. For a heartbeat, the air around you shimmers—just enough to wonder if the dream clings, if the characters linger in the shadows, waiting for you to speak their names again.
