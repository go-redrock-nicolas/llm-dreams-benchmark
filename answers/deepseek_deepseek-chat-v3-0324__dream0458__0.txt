I am dreaming. The air hums with the scent of damp earth and ozone, thick with the promise of something unseen. I stand at the edge of a vast, overgrown labyrinth—walls woven from jade vines and thorned roses, pulsing gently as if breathing. The sky above is a bruised twilight, streaked with ribbons of bioluminescent clouds that writhe like living serpents.  

A whisper curls around my ear, neither voice nor wind, but something in between: *"You don’t belong here."* But my feet press forward anyway, soles sinking into the moss-choked ground. The first turn is tight, the thorns snagging at my sleeves, drawing thin lines of silver light where they graze my skin. Pain? No. It drips like liquid mercury, pooling in my palm before reshaping—into a key, into a blade, into a compass with no needle, only a slow-spinning black star.  

Then, the walls begin to move. The labyrinth reshapes itself with a groan, forcing me into narrower passages, the vines tightening like constricting serpents. My breath comes jagged, but my reflection in the pooled mercury shows something else—a figure with storm-lit eyes, shoulders wrapped in shadow that isn’t mine, or maybe *wasn’t* mine until now.  

A growl shudders through the green-dark, and from the maze’s heart lumbers a creature of splintered obsidian and liquid gold—its eyes are missing, its mouth a yawning pit where voices echo. *"Run,"* it hisses, except the word is my own, thrown back at me. But my feet root to the earth, because suddenly I *know* this fear isn’t new. I’ve carried it before, sewn into the marrow of me.  

So I lift the mercury blade, which is now a mirror, which is now a *doorway*—and I step *into* the creature’s maw.  

Darkness. Then—  

—a garden of floating islands, each tethered to the next by bridges of starlight. The wounds on my arms bloom into ink-black petals. The strength I’d ignored (buried, betrayed) hums beneath my ribs like a swarm of ember-winged bees. I flex my fingers, and the dream shudders. It always did belong to me.  

I wake with the taste of thunder and honey on my tongue.
