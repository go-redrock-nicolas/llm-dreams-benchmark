I am dreaming. …you find yourself standing in a grand library that stretches farther than the horizon. The towering shelves bend and twist around each other, housing not only books, but shimmering vials of scent, boxes of forgotten laughter, kaleidoscopic feathers, and tiny crystal orbs containing swirling galaxies of memory. Each item is a perfect snapshot, a living artifact of everything you have ever seen, read, heard, or felt.

With the touch of a finger, you summon not only the precise words of every book you’ve read since childhood, but also the sunlit corners of each library, the patterns of dust in the air, the particular smell of old pages mingled with the afterglow of adventure. Someone speaks to you in a language you’d only heard as a child—suddenly you recall every phrase, every nuance, the songs your grandmother hummed in that tongue, the embroidery on her apron, even the heat of her hands as she braided your hair.

You decide to experiment: you ask your mind to retrieve everything you have ever learned about the stars. Instantly, swirling lights fill the ceiling, coalescing into constellations—ancient and modern—mythic beasts dancing above you. Saturn’s rings are there, spun anew in front of your eyes, each icy particle drawn in perfect clarity. Scientific theories, old astronomical charts, Galileo’s trembling excitement, and your childhood glee at spotting Orion—all thread together in a tangible tapestry.

In this state, you become aware of other senses, catalogued and enhanced. The taste of a rare fruit from a distant country returns with such intensity that your mouth waters; you recall the melody of laughter echoing in a Parisian café and the precise texture of the cobblestones underfoot.

You realize you could spend eternity wandering these halls. The line between memory and imagination blurs—one step, and you’re reliving a moment; another, and you’re inventing a new world, seamlessly woven from the infinite cloth of experience and possibility. And as you stand in this boundless hall, you understand: with perfect memory, every moment lived is a treasure you can revisit, reshape, and relive again and again—a universe folded inside the mind, vast and radiant as any dream.
