I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence: The Shadowed Hierophants**  

You awaken in a dusk-lit metropolis where obsidian towers claw at a bruised sky, their surfaces alive with bioluminescent veins that pulse like slow, celestial heartbeats. The air hums with whispered protocols, unspoken yet binding. Here, status is measured by the depth and dynamism of one’s shadow. The elite stride with silhouettes that writhe and ripple—serpentine, phosphorescent, singing subsonic hymns. Yours is meek, a faint smudge clinging timidly to your heels.  

You navigate a plaza where shadows coil into intricate mosaics underfoot. A Hierophant passes, their shadow a storm of winged creatures morphing into galaxies. Instinct screams: *Do not intersect*. But your foot grazes the edge of their tableau. The shadow *hisses*, recoiling as if scalded. The crowd freezes. A thousand heads turn, their eyes voids flickering with ultraviolet fury.  

A gong reverberates—a sound felt in the marrow. The Hierophant raises a hand, and the ground liquifies beneath you. Shadows surge like black tides, their tendrils knitting a cocoon around your limbs. You struggle, but the darkness is sentient, viscous. It floods your nostrils, your throat, sweet and cold as midnight nectar.  

Your body dissolves. Not into nothingness, but into *shade*. You become a silhouette, weightless yet bound to the heels of passersby. Your consciousness flickers at the edge of perception, forced to mirror the movements of a novice scribe, then a glassblower whose shadow driks molten gold. Each touch of light sears; each step is puppet-like, involuntary.  

Days blur. Nights are worse. The living shadows feast on starlight, curling into fractal patterns you cannot mimic. You ache to scream, but your voice is moth-wing thin, audible only to other exiles—faceless shades flickering at the city’s periphery, their whispers a chorus of regrets.  

A dawn arrives, syrupy and green-gold. A child’s shadow—untethered, rebellious—brushes yours. For a heartbeat, you feel corporeal again, a flicker of warmth. But the Hierophants descend, their shadows swallowing the anomaly. As you’re dragged back into the dance of obedience, one truth etches itself into your fading mind: *To err here is to become the rhythm of the world, but never its song.*  

You wake, your own shadow pooling beneath you, quivering like a reprimanded dog. The taste of nectar lingers, and your limbs hum with the memory of tides.
