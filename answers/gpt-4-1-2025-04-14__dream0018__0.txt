I am dreaming.

It begins with a thunderstorm, the kind that rattles the windows and makes the air hum with static anticipation. In the blue, flickering half-light of my dream, I wander my home—a place that is at once familiar and strange. The walls waver as if made from candle wax on a hot summer day, sagging and bulging under the onslaught of the storm’s demand. Above, great wooden beams arch and creak, leaking raindrops that fall with the cadence of ticking clocks. The floor beneath my feet has softened to the consistency of wet cardboard, the boards threatening to give way with every uncertain step.

Panic rises in me like the water pooling around my ankles. I realize that if I do not act—if I do not save this place, this fragile sanctuary woven from memory and longing—it will collapse into the sodden earth and leave me adrift. But my pockets are empty save for a bent spoon, a spool of scarlet thread, and exactly three copper coins—hardly the tools fit for an architect or a savior. My only companion is the fluttering anxiety in my chest and a scant knowledge of how things are supposed to work, gleaned from watching old repairmen patch up childhood homes.

Resolute, I hunt for materials in the shadowy corners of my dream-house. I tear down faded curtains to stuff into the cracks. I unscrew picture frames, using their glass to reinforce weak window panes. The scarlet thread winds through the wood like a lifeline, binding the trembling beams and doorways. With the bent spoon, I scoop spackle from the depths of cupboards, desperately patching fissures in the walls.

From outside, the wind howls encouragement or warning—I cannot discern which. As I struggle, rooms rearrange themselves, passages turning in upon themselves like a Mobius strip, making the work both ceaseless and impossible to finish. When exhaustion threatens to drag me down, I discover a new determination hidden in the melodic pitter-patter of rain on the roof above—a song that reminds me this house, no matter how warped or battered, shelters all I know and love.

Splinters pierce my fingers and sweat blurs my sight, but slowly, miraculously, the patchwork “repairs” begin to hold. My home, though ramshackle and eccentric, becomes a strange, fortress-like haven, defended by the oddities of my resourcefulness and imagination. I curl beneath a patchworked quilt of old newspaper and sunbeam, listening as the storm passes and a golden light brightens through the patched glass.

Finally, as the dream dissolves, I walk through newly-stabilized halls—each scar and stitch a testament to the desperate, wondrous will to protect what matters most, no matter the odds or the strangeness of the journey.
