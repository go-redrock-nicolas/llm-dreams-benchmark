I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the midst of a serene and tranquil valley, surrounded by towering trees that stretch towards the sky like colossal sentinels. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers that dance in the gentle breeze. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the landscape, imbuing everything with an aura of peace and tranquility.

As I wander through the valley, I come upon a clearing, and in the center of it stands a magnificent wooden lodge, its wooden boards gleaming with a soft, golden patina. A delicate wooden sign above the entrance reads "Sanctuary of Shared Solace". The doors are open, inviting me to enter, and I feel an inexplicable sense of longing to reveal my emotional sanctuary within its walls.

As I step inside, I am enveloped by a warm and comforting atmosphere, filled with the soft murmur of hushed conversations and the soothing sounds of gentle music drifting through the air. I am greeted by a kind-faced woman with a gentle smile, who introduces herself as Alice, the retreat facilitator. She welcomes me warmly and invites me to join the others in the group, assuring me that I am among friends who have come to unravel the tangled threads of their own inner struggles.

The room is filled with people from all walks of life, each with a story to share, each with a fragment of their soul still bearing the scars of pain, and yet, in this sacred space, they are choosing to bravely confront their demons, side by side.

As we begin sharing, a quiet woman to my left starts speaking about a childhood trauma that still lingers within her, a secret she has hidden for years. Her voice trembles, but her words are met with understanding and compassion. The weight of her bravery in the face of pain lifts a burden from my own shoulders, allowing me to take a step forward.

Further down the row, a young man begins to speak about his self-doubt and fear of failure, his eyes glistening with tears. I see echoes of my own struggles in his words, feeling a spark of kinship ignite within me. We start to exchange a knowing glance, our souls somehow resonating with each other, acknowledging that we are not alone in this journey.

As the sharing circle continues, I start to feel more fearful, yet somehow freed. I let my guard down, allowing the accumulated emotions to finally surface. Alice offers a gentle nod, and I begin to open up, revealing the terror, the frustration, and the tears I've suppressed for so long.

Suddenly, a woman in the corner of the room starts speaking about anxiety, about the constant buzzing in her mind and the crushing fears that consume her at night. Her words shake me to the core. The parallels in our stories become clear, forming an inseparable connection between us. We instantly bond, two twisted threads woven into an intricate tapestry of shared understanding, an exchange of perspectives born from the experiences of two individuals caught in the cycle of introspection.

In this moment, the struggle to breathe is just beginning. For the first time, I understand that this isn't about inherently succeeding or failing; it's about the process of peeling back the layers of the soul and rediscovering ourselves. Every face in that room reflects this understanding â€“ each member is not merely a stranger but a pilgrim who has wandered into this honest sanctuary, along with countless others to be found, eager to 'eventually start'.
