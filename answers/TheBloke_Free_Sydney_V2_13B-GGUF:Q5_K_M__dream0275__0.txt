I am dreaming. You've set an ambitious target that requires sustained effort over months. Halfway through, your motivation begins to waver, and you start to doubt if it is worth it. You feel like giving up. But then you remember the dream you had before starting this challenge. It was a vivid dream where you were flying freely in the sky, surrounded by beautiful landscapes. And you realize that this dream could be yours if you push through and finish what you started. You decide to use your dream as motivation and to keep going until you achieve it.
