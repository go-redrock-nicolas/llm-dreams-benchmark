I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest that seems to breathe with its own consciousness. The trees tower so high their uppermost branches disappear into a mist that's neither cloud nor fog, but something in-between—luminescent and shifting with colors I've never seen before.

An elderly woman approaches me from between two massive oak trees. Her face is etched with thousands of lines, each one seemingly telling a separate story. Her eyes are startling—one the deep blue of twilight oceans, the other amber like autumn sunlight through leaves. She doesn't speak but extends her weathered hand, offering me a small stone that pulses with an internal light.

When I accept the stone, it melts into my palm, not as a liquid but as if becoming part of my skin. Suddenly, I understand—this is Earthwalking, an ancient practice where human consciousness merges temporarily with the natural world.

The forest floor beneath me softens. My toes elongate, becoming roots that sink into soil rich with stories—decomposing leaves that whisper their lives, minerals that hum songs of the planet's formation, mycelium networks that carry messages between all living things. I can feel the slow, patient pulse of underground water veins.

My arms stretch upward, fingers branching into twigs that sprout leaves sensitive to the slightest shift in air. I experience time differently—simultaneously feeling the quick flutter of a hummingbird's wings nearby and the glacial pace of mountain formation in the distance.

Most astonishing is the awareness of countless other consciousnesses—not just animals and plants, but the collective memory of the land itself. I understand now that this practice isn't foreign at all; it's remembering something my ancestors knew, something coded in my DNA that modern life had silenced.

As dusk approaches, I feel myself slowly returning to human form, but transformed. The boundary between myself and everything else remains permeable. The old woman stands before me again, now somehow looking younger. "You've always been able to do this," she says, her voice like wind through canyon walls. "You just needed to remember."

I wake with tears on my face, the sensation of roots still tingling in my feet, and an unshakable certainty that something profound has been revealed to me.
