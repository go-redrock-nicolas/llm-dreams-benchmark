I am dreaming. *The scene unfolds in a surreal office space where the walls pulse with an ethereal, fluorescent glow. The ceiling seems to stretch infinitely upward, disappearing into a swirling vortex of paperwork and digital displays. My desk begins to multiply before my eyes, splitting and reproducing like cells under a microscope, each new surface immediately covered with towers of documents that seem to breathe and whisper urgent deadlines.*

The project folders on my desk transform into living entities - one burns with actual flames but never consumes itself, another drips water that forms impossible patterns in the air, and a third emanates a haunting melody that sounds like a deadline timer merged with a melancholic lullaby. Each demands attention with increasing urgency, their presence growing more domineering by the second.

My supervisor appears, but not as a person - rather as a shifting collection of office supplies that speaks in the voice of every boss I've ever had. They float toward me, trailing sticky notes like cosmic debris, and materialize a fourth project that takes the form of a crystalline cube pulsing with red light. As it's placed before me, my chair begins to sink into the floor, which has become a quicksand of spreadsheets and email chains.

The walls of the office begin to fold inward like an origami nightmare, bringing other stressed workers closer - but their faces keep changing, morphing between different colleagues, clients, and even my own reflection. Time displays on various screens show different hours simultaneously, some running forward, others backward, creating a maddening temporal chaos.

My computer mouse comes alive, scurrying across the desk like a real rodent, leaving trails of glowing binary code in its wake. The keyboard keys float upward, forming constellations of urgent tasks against the now-cosmic ceiling. I try to grab them, but my hands pass through them like smoke, while the deadlines tick louder and louder, transforming into a crescendo of alarm bells and notification sounds.

The dream intensifies as the four projects begin to orbit around me like planets around a stressed-out sun, their gravity pulling at my consciousness, while the office space continues to distort and reshape itself according to the rhythm of my mounting anxiety...

*The sensations are overwhelmingly real yet impossible, capturing that unique dream-state where logic bends and reality becomes fluid, all while the core feeling of work-related pressure remains crushingly tangible.*
