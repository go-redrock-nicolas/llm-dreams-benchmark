I am dreaming.

I find myself in the heart of an ancient forest—towering oaks interlace their branches high above, their leaves casting a mosaic of jade and gold light on the mossy path below. This is not an ordinary place. Everywhere, luminous tendrils of mist curl gently around the roots and rise through the shafts of light, drifting like lost memories.

This is the sanctuary of the support network, a haven woven together by the silent understanding of those who know pain and hope in equal measure. Here, every traveler carries a lantern glowing with the warmth of compassion. Its glow pulses gently as we draw close to one another, signaling a willingness to listen, to help, to hold and heal.

Suddenly, from across the glade, I sense a tremor—a call that resonates not with words, but with pure emotion, as if someone has poured their heartache into the very air. The lantern at my side flares in response, guiding me to the source.

I step softly between fern and stone, and find her: a figure knelt at the base of a great willow, her face veiled in her hands, silver tears gathering at her feet. She is a pilgrim in pain, surrounded by the pale ghosts of old regrets.

With gentleness, I kneel beside her. My lantern’s light pools around us, dissolving the shadows that cling to her. I don’t speak right away. Instead, I offer her my presence; my silence is an open space where her sorrow can safely unfold.

When she is ready, I ask—not in voice, but in the language of dreams, where understanding flows like water—“What weighs upon you? Let me help you hold it.”

She tells her story, each word a soft stone dropped into the reflecting pool between us: lost love, disappointment, a loneliness so dense she says it feels like iron pressing on her chest. I listen with every part of my being, feeling her pain bleed into the roots of the willow, which absorb it, transforming anguish into gentle strength.

As she speaks, the lantern grows brighter. The darkness recedes. I take her hands—warm, trembling, human—and together we rise. Around us, the other members of this dreaming network drift from the trees, their lanterns glowing, their eyes gentle. We form a circle, a living constellation, our lights overlapping until there is no more dusk, only the soft gold of mutual understanding.

Here, no one struggles alone. Here, to reach out is to be met with empathy as bright and real as sunlight after rain.

In this dream, I remember—and will remember when I wake—the extraordinary tenderness that arises when we choose to meet each other in difficult times, our hearts wide as forests, our lanterns always ready.
