I am dreaming. You face a personal crisis that feels impossible to handle alone. When you reach out to others around you, they either don't understand or aren't interested. You feel isolated and powerless. 

Suddenly, you see a door in front of you. It looks ordinary but somehow it seems like the only way out. 

As you approach the door, you hear a faint voice whispering from behind it: "Be brave, trust me, and open the door." You hesitate for a moment, then you grab the doorknob and turn it counterclockwise. 

The door creaks open slowly revealing a dark corridor that leads somewhere unknown. 

You take a deep breath and step inside.
