I am dreaming. Each breath is a sweet explosion of sunlight. I find myself standing barefoot on the crest of a grassy hill that undulates beneath me like a gentle sea. The air shimmers with an impossible gold, the sky unfurling over my head in billowing clouds of electric lavender and peacock blue. Laughter bubbles up from somewhere deep within, spilling forth richer and fuller than I’ve ever known. Its sound echoes out across the meadows and seems to birth wildflowers wherever it touches—riotous clumps of poppies and lupins bloom, their colors brighter than any in the waking world.

I spin slowly, arms flung wide, astonished by the effervescent joy humming through my marrow. The grass feels like velvet, and with every step, crystalline notes ring out—a symphony rising from the earth itself, synchronized to my heartbeat. The simple act of moving, of waking breath in my chest, seems to merit a jubilation so profound that tears well up in my eyes—not sad tears, but a sparkling overflow, the way rain spills from clouds full to bursting.

All at once, I notice that I am not alone. Around me, figures appear—some familiar, some strange, all smiling with the same unbridled glee. We link hands and leap together, weightless now, bounding higher and higher, endlessly suspended in a moment of exuberance. Above us, the sky fractures into a million shining fragments, each reflecting memories and hopes, loves and songs. The world feels impossibly light, as if joy itself is the gravity tethering us to the dream.

I am surprised—but also, for the first time, I remember: joy can be bottomless, boundless, and here in this dream, it is as infinite as the sky.
