I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a bustling cityscape at twilight, the skyscrapers around me casting their long, dark shadows across the pavement, illuminated only by the soft glow of streetlamps and the distant, neon flicker of advertising billboards. The air is filled with the usual city symphony: the dull hum of traffic, distant sirens, and the faint chatters of people hurrying home.

Suddenly, the scene shifts. The city around me begins to undulate and pulse, like the rhythm of a heartbeat. The buildings twist and contort, their once-sturdy structures now writhing like serpents, their windows shattering and reforming into glittering, fragmented tears flowing down their facades. Panic starts to rise in my throat, but I can't move, transfixed by the surreal spectacle unfolding around me.

The city stops its convulsive dance, and an eerie silence falls. I look down at my hands, which are now glowing with an ethereal light. I can feel a strange energy coursing through my veins, a pulsing, living force that responds to my every thought. As I focus my mind, the energy extends out from my body, reaching out and touching the city. To my astonishment, I see the city's condition reflected in the energy's glow: the darker the glow, the more negative the impact. My heart sinks as I watch the city's systemic, invisible wounds laid bare before my eyes.

I turn my attention to a nearby street, its surface gleaming with the reflection of distant lights. The energy from my hands reveals a dense, inky black patch spreading out from a nearby convenience store. I step inside, drawn inexorably by the darkness. The store is brightly lit, filled with the usual suspects - rows of fatty, sugar-laden snacks, energy drinks in gaudy colours, and piles of over-packaged goods. It's only as I reach for a familiar,*crisp apple*-flavoured, neon-green soda that I realize the truth: every time I've purchased this small, convenient pleasure, I've stained the world a little darker.

My gaze shifts to the tall, refridgerators humming in the corner, their doors plastered with posters of smiling celebrities hawking their various wares. The energy from my hands reveals the cold, harsh truth: the energy wasted on constantly chilling these beverages, the packaging that can't be recycled, the greenhouse gases emitted during their transportation... each decision has adds to the city's environmental burden.

I look back to the hand holding the soda. It's trembling now, the light within it flickering like a candle in the wind. I feel a sharp, painful tug in my chest, a profound conflict tearing at my soul. The convenience, the pleasure that these little indulgences bring... it's all built on a foundation of destruction, a horror I can no longer pretend I don't see.

The dream shifts again. I'm walking home through a park, its once-verdant trees now withered and black, their leaves crumbling to dust at my touch. The grass is gone, replaced by cracked, barren earth. The world is dying, and it's happening because of choices I've made; choices that I never considered had consequences this severe.

I wake up, panting, the sheets tangled around me. My heart is pounding in my chest, my mind racing. I know now that my actions have consequences, consequences that I can no longer ignore. I take a deep breath, resolve shining in my eyes. I'll make changes, small ones at first, but they'll add up. I'll find new ways to seek pleasure, new ways to live that won't destroy the world around me. I won't let my city, my world, fade into more dreams like this one.
