I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, frozen mountain range. The air is crisp and cold, biting at your skin as it creeps into the crevices of your clothing. Your breath escapes in visible puffs, merging with the soft, icy fog that obscures the view beyond the ridge. The mountains stretch endlessly, their jagged peaks piercing the lavender and orange hues of the setting sun.

You begin to walk, your footsteps muffled by a thick layer of pristine snow that crunches softly underfoot. The lower regions of the mountains are lush with dense, emerald green forests that contrast sharply with the stark, white expanse surrounding them. As you ascend, the forest thins, revealing barren rocks and snow-covered slopes leading to the towering peaks.

The air grows thinner, and your breath quickens with the exertion of climbing. The cold begins to seep into your bones, numbing them even through layers of protective gear. Your journey becomes more challenging, with each step requiring more effort as the snow has deepened and becomes more powdery. The once serene silence of the mountain is now intermittently pierced by the sound of shifting snow and gusts of icy wind piercing through the thin atmosphere.

As you crest another ridge, the temperature drops further, and the sky becomes a deeper hue of violet and pink, casting shadows over the frozen landscape. The snow glitters as if made of diamonds, reflecting the last rays of theSetting Sun, creating an otherworldly glow that envelops everything. Yet, despite its beauty, you feel a growing sense of unease, an instinctual tug that something is wrong.

The sense of impending danger intensifies when you notice faint cracks appearing in the snow around you.

Crrrkk...
