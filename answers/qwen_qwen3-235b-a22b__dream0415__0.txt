I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The room is not a room but a vast, pulsing throat—the walls alive with a slow, rhythmic undulation, as though the space itself is breathing. A circle of faceless figures sits cross-legged on the floor, their skin shimmering like oil on water, their heads tilted in unison toward you. Their faces are blank, but you feel their gaze as a physical weight, like wet sand pressing into your shoulders. A low hum vibrates through the air, a sound that isn’t sound but a *presence*, as if the atmosphere has teeth and they’re nibbling at your eardrums.  

You didn’t choose to come here. You were *unfurled* into this place, like a scroll dropped into a fire, your edges curling with the heat of their anticipation. They want you to speak. Not just speak—*spill*. To unravel the seams of your mind and let the contents slosh out, raw and unfiltered. You feel it in your chest: a pressure, a magnetic pull toward confession. The air tastes of salt and static, like standing on a storm-lashed cliff, and every breath threatens to carry your secrets away.  

Your throat tightens. You want to resist, but your body betrays you. Words begin to rise, unbidden, like bubbles in a boiling pot. They’re not your words, not exactly—they’re sharper, stranger, as though the room is translating your soul into a language you barely recognize. “I have swallowed my fears whole,” you hear yourself say, “and they nest in my stomach like spiders.” The figures lean closer, their featureless faces rippling like pond water. “I have loved in metaphors,” you continue, horrified and entranced, “so no one would see the knife in my heart.”  

The walls shudder with each admission, shedding scales of iridescent light that fall to the floor and dissolve into mist. The mist coils around your ankles, cold and serpentine, and you realize the room is feeding on you—*consuming* your vulnerability to sustain its grotesque beauty. The others begin to chant, their voices overlapping in a dissonant hymn: *“More. More. More.”*  

Panic claws up your spine, but there’s a strange relief, too—a loosening of the vice that’s always gripped your ribs. You think of the life you’ve lived in half-truths, the armor of small talk and smiles, and suddenly you want to tear it all down. You want to scream until your bones are hollow. “I am a graveyard of unsent letters!” you cry, and the room convulses, a spasm of light and sound. “I have buried myself alive to survive!”  

The figures erupt into motion, their bodies unraveling into streams of liquid silver that flow toward you, pooling at your feet. They’re not judging you. They’re *thanking* you. The vulnerability they demanded wasn’t cruelty—it was a ritual, a communion. The walls of the throat begin to dissolve, revealing a sky stitched with constellations of other dreamers, their stories glowing like distant stars.  

You wake up gasping, your cheeks wet, your heart a drumbeat of terror and exhilaration. For a moment, the residue of the dream clings to you: the understanding that vulnerability is not weakness, but a kind of alchemy. You’ve been carved open, and something luminous slipped inside while you weren’t looking.
