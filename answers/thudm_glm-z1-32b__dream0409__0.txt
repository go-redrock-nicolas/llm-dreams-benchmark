I am dreaming. The world around me is a blur of colors and sounds, but my focus is drawn to a distorted mirror in the center of a bustling marketplace. In the glass, I don't see my own reflection. Instead, it's a composite of people I've known—my coworkers, a childhood friend who betrayed me, and even my own frustrated younger self—all racing and overlapping in a grotesque, kaleidoscopic dance. My hands are stained with ink from a broken fountain pen that's oozing onto the cobblestones, each drop turning into tiny, screaming mouths that chant my most private insecurities. The air tastes metallic, like rust and regret. I try to scream, but my voice dissolves into static, echoing off buildings that seem to be melting into waterfalls of alphabet soup. A black cat with eyes like shattered onyx watches, its tail twitching with glee. In the distance, a xylophone plays a haunting melody that's both familiar and wrong. I wake up, the sheets tangled like a spider's web, and realize I've been clenching a receipt from a bar I swore I'd never patronize. The clock glows 3:47 AM. Outside, the first rays of sunrise catch the edge of my windowframe, casting a thin, hopeful golden stripe across the floor. It's still there, that faint line of light, even though I won't look at it for days.
In my dream, I am standing at the edge of an abyss that yawns like a mouth full of jagged teeth. The air is thick with the scent of burnt cinnamon and gasoline, and the sky above me is a swirling kaleidoscope of purples and pinks, as if the sun is bleeding through a stained-glass cathedral. A thousand fireflies, their glow flickering like faulty neon signs, swarm around me, their wings beating a rhythm that echoes the mantra I’ve repeated a thousand times: *always be kind, always be honest, always be enough*. But the words blur as they leave my lips, dissolving into static.

Before me, the abyss is not empty. It’s filled with things that shouldn’t be there: a bicycle from my childhood, its wheels rusted and spokes twisted like a broken spine; a letter I never sent, its envelope addressed to a version of myself that doesn’t exist; a pocket watch stopped at 3:47 AM—the same time I woke up gasping for air on the nights when I’ve eaten my feelings instead of calling a friend. These objects float, suspended in a viscous liquid that sloshes with the weight of my regrets. The bicycle’s creaks in sympathy, each link groaning with the collective guilt of every time I’ve said "I’m fine" when I wasn’t.

I step closer, my feet sinking into the liquid—thick as honey, cold as a draft from an open window. The letter unfurls itself in midair, the ink bleeding into the liquid, forming words that slither like snakes: *you are not who you think you are. You are not who they want you to be. You are a house of cards in a hurricane.* The fireflies dim, their glow fading to a dim, sickly green. The bicycle’s wheels begin to spin, not with the gentle motion of a child’s ride, but with a frantic, desperate pace, the spokes clicking like a metronome counting down to a deadline I’ve already missed. The pocket watch opens, its lid revealing a miniature stage where tiny versions of me—some in business suits, some in pajamas, all shouting over each other—recite apologies, excuses, demands. The words collide, creating a cacophony that drowns out the sound of my own breathing.

Then, a figure appears on the far side of the abyss, their silhouette sharp against the bleeding sunset. It’s me, but older, wiser, and infinitely more tired. Their eyes are the color of storm clouds, and their mouth is a thin line that could cut glass. They hold out a hand, the palm upturned, offering a single, glowing emerald. The emerald pulses with a green light that burns brighter than the fireflies, brighter than the neon signs of the city I’ve sworn to leave behind. But as I reach for it, the liquid in the abyss begins to rise, lapping at my knees, my thighs. The bicycle’s wheels slow, then stop. The letter crinkles, its edges curling like burnt paper. The pocket watch clicks, and the hands spin backward, the numbers blurring until they’re nothing but a smear of black ink.

I wake up, my chest heaving, the sheet tangled around my ankles like a bad-luck charm. The clock glows 3:47 AM, and I realize with a jolt that the emerald in my dream is still there, perched on the edge of my nightstand, its green glow faint but unmistakable. I reach for it, but my hand stops short, hovering like a bird deciding whether to fly or crash. The city outside is silent, the windows fogged with the breath of a million strangers. I press my forehead against the glass, feeling the cold seep into my bones, and wonder—if the abyss is real, if the emerald is real, if I’m real—is there a way to cross without falling?
