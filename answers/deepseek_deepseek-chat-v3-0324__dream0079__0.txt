I am dreaming. The air around me is thick with the scent of damp earth and something electric, like the moment before a storm breaks. I stand at the edge of a vast, shifting labyrinth—its walls not of stone, but of towering, living brambles, their thorns gleaming like polished obsidian under a sky stained in twilight hues. The path ahead twists and coils like a serpent, vanishing into shadow. My breath quickens; I feel the weight of the challenge before me, immense and suffocating.  

Desperate for direction, I turn to my community—figures woven from memory and dream, their faces shifting like candlelight on water. There’s Old Marla, her voice the rustle of autumn leaves, hands gnarled as ancient roots. Beside her stands Eli, whose laughter used to echo across summer fields, though now his eyes are solemn. A chorus of others gathers—some familiar, some half-remembered—each a presence as real as the ache in my chest.  

"Help me," I plead, my voice trembling. "I can't do this alone."  

Marla reaches out, pressing a sprig of dried lavender into my palm. "You think the maze is there to trap you," she murmurs, "but it's only asking you to wander awhile, until you forget to be afraid."  

Eli nods, stepping forward. "Remember when we crossed the flooded creek as kids? You hesitated, thinking the current too strong. But the water wasn’t your enemy—you just hadn’t learned to move with it yet."  

The others murmur in agreement, their voices merging like wind through reeds. Someone places a lantern in my other hand—its flame burns blue, casting eerie, dancing light on the bramble walls.  

And then, all at once, the labyrinth seems to breathe. The thorns shiver and part, not to grant me escape, but to invite me deeper. My fears don’t vanish, but they no longer feel like chains.  

The dream lingers as I take the first step—forward, not toward an end, but into the unknown, guided by the whispers of those who walk beside me, even when I can’t see them.
