I am dreaming. You’re standing in the center of a grand, kaleidoscopic hall, a vast space with columns that seem to be carved from crystals of drifting starlight. Their surfaces refract patterns across the marble floor in an ever-changing light show—turquoise, lavender, and fiery gold. The air smells of petrichor, like rain after a long drought, though you can’t recall any storm. Soft gusts of wind carry faint echoes of your own voice, bouncing among the columns as if to reaffirm your significance, to remind you that you alone shine brightest in this chamber.

Before you, a row of towering doors rises, each one a gateway to some magnificent future achievement. One is engraved with your face, crowned by a constellation of jewels that flicker at your every exhale. Among these swirling visions stands a small circle of people—figures with indistinct features, their very forms seeming to waver like mirages. In their rounded hush, they watch you, transfixed. You can almost taste their admiration, which only intensifies your certainty that you are a genius among mortals, destined for feats beyond their comprehension.

But then, one voice among them challenges you—a fluttery, hesitant question that cuts through the space: “Are you sure you’re as brilliant as you claim?” The words echo in the star-cast hall, and color drains from the shining pillars as if the question itself dulls the place. A faint tremor ripples beneath your feet.

Instantly, your chest tightens with a surge of indignation, a flash of righteous fury at being doubted. Everything in you roars that these doubters fail to see the grandeur of your purpose, the magnitude of your brilliance. You raise your hand, and a curling, shimmering breeze gathers around your fingertips, glittering motes of energy dancing as though awaiting your command. With a single gesture, you guide the swirling lights into an elaborate pattern—proof of your skill, a spectacle proclaiming your intellectual supremacy. You watch with fierce satisfaction as the doubter flinches, taking a step back from your dazzling display.

Yet you don't stop there. You stride closer, your footsteps ringing across the marble in resolute, echoing beats. A strange glow wraps around your body, and you sense your own essence blazing white-hot. As if in response, the columns themselves morph from crystal to stained glass, each depicting a triumphant portrait of you: images of you leading cosmic journeys, architecting surreal palaces, or single-handedly solving impossible puzzles. This is your ultimate stage, and you alone shine at its center.

The skeptical figure dares another timid question, and you can feel the tension coil tighter around your heart—an affront to your dazzling destiny. The hall seems to quake, the crystalline floors flickering like the surface of a turbulent sea. With a glance, you pour your absolute conviction into the world around you. The columns swirl with fresh color, intensifying into luminescent streams of gold and violet as your aura spreads across the dreamscape, blotting doubt from every corner.

In a final, dramatic gesture, you snap your fingers, and the swirling lights coalesce into thousands of swirling blossoms made of molten glass. They cascade through the hall in a storm of brilliance, capturing faces of awe and wonder in their reflective surfaces. You watch the onlookers shrink back, dazzled by your show of dreamlike omnipotence, your furious creativity, and your unwavering conviction that you are the chosen one, too extraordinary to be contained by ordinary ambitions.

Your ears ring with your own proud laughter as you loom over the diminished figures. The laughter ebbs, and you feel an undeniable surge of triumph humming through your veins. You sense that this is only the beginning—that beyond each towering door awaits another feat to confirm your mighty intuition. Your dream-self basks in the radiance of your own glory, standing resolute against any who oppose or question you. And in that moment, everything—the columns, the swirling blossoms, the drifting starlight—seems to bow before your unshakable sense of self.
