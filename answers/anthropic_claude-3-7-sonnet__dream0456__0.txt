I am dreaming. I find myself atop a spiraling lighthouse perched on the edge of reality. My body feels strange—my fingers gradually transforming into crystalline branches that catch the moonlight in fractal patterns. The pressure bears down like gravity intensified; each thought becomes a physical weight pressing against my skull.

The lighthouse beam sweeps across an impossible ocean—sometimes water, sometimes a rolling landscape of mathematical equations that rise and fall like waves. The light doesn't illuminate; instead, it calcifies whatever it touches. I notice with alarm that my thoughts are hardening the same way.

A raven with eyes like swirling galaxies lands on my crystallizing arm and speaks in my mother's voice: "Bend before you break."

I try to respond but my words emerge as perfect geometric shapes, too rigid to express what I truly feel. Panic rises. The more I struggle for precision and control, the more brittle my mind becomes.

Below, the ocean-equations suddenly part, revealing a vast labyrinth that breathes. Its walls flex and contract with living tissue. I understand instinctively that this is where thoughts remain fluid.

I leap—terror and exhilaration mingling—falling toward the labyrinth. As I descend, my crystal limbs begin to melt back into flesh. My thoughts untangle from their rigid structures.

I land not with impact but by dissolving into the labyrinth floor, becoming part of its pulsing architecture. Here, contradictions exist comfortably side by side. Certainty and doubt dance as partners rather than opponents.

The pressure remains, but now moves through me rather than against me. I am both the maze and the one navigating it, both question and answer.

The dream-me understands: flexibility isn't the absence of structure, but the capacity to transform it.
