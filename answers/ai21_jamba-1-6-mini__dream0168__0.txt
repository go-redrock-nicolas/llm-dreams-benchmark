I am dreaming. You are standing amidst chaos, the city around you shrouded in an eerie orange glow as towering infernos rage in the distance. The ground vibrates beneath your feet, homes crumble, and sirens wail. You are directing emergency services during multiple simultaneous disasters. Your teamâ€™s resources are stretched thin, yet you remain calm and resolute, like Nash as he led ERP into business operations. The communication systems buzz and crackle, failing repeatedly, forcing you to rely on nothing but your sharpened instincts and the raw drive to save as many lives as possible. Lives dangle precariously in the balance, and every split-second decision you make carries the weight of life and death. This is your battlefield; this is your test.
