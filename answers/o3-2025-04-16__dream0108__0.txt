I am dreaming. It begins the way dreams often do—without warning, already in full gallop.

You’re striding through the triage bay of St. Elara’s Hospital, clipboard in hand, when the hallway lights flicker and reality tilts as though the entire building has inhaled. Fluorescent tubes buzz like disturbed wasps overhead. A wall-mounted clock liquefies, its numbers trickling down the plaster like droplets of mercury. Somewhere distant, sirens bend and warp, the pitches sliding around each other the way oil swirls through water.

Outside, an invisible calamity has ruptured the city: a chain of factory explosions, a tunnel collapse, and a chemical fire at the river docks—each one feeding a relentless tide of casualties. They pour through the double doors in waves, borne on gurneys that look at first like wheeled lilies drifting into the fluorescent glare. You clutch the clipboard harder. The paper seems to pulse beneath your thumb like a heartbeat.

A nurse with galaxies for eyes—twin spirals of star-stuff swirling in her irises—leans close and murmurs, “We’re out of beds.” You nod, though the words take an extra second to reach whatever part of you can still understand language. “Then walls will have to become beds,” you reply, and in the pliant logic of dreams, the walls obediently unfold into cots, sheeted in crisp white that smells faintly of ozone.

A fresh tremor ripples through the floor, as if some gargantuan creature is pacing the sub-basements. IV poles sway like reeds in wind. Overhead, copper pipes moan—a low, metallic lament. An intercom crackles: “Code Crescent, Code Crescent,” a designation no waking hospital has ever used. Yet you know, with dream-perfect certainty, that it means “resources below fifteen percent.”

You sprint—or float, it’s hard to tell—down the main corridor. It lengthens ahead of you, tiling replicating underfoot like a printer spitting pages, each square stamped with footprints that glow phosphorescent green. Doors on either side open onto impossible scenes: an operating theatre lit by candle chandeliers; a radiology suite where x-ray films flutter from the ceiling like raven feathers; a pharmacy whose shelves ripple away into an ocean of pill bottles bobbing like buoys.

In Trauma Room Seven stands Dr. Horowitz, though here he wears a coat that morphs through colors with the rhythm of his pulse—scarlet to ultraviolet and back. “We need whole blood!” he says. A pneumatic tube rattles overhead, but the carriers are empty; the blood bank is dry. Then a case cart rolls in carrying glimmering bags filled with aurora borealis instead of plasma, ribbons of green and purple light swirling within. “Will it work?” you ask. “If we believe it will,” Horowitz answers, eyes glittering like cut garnets.

You cut through the cafeteria, now transformed into a command center. Portable vents gust cold air that smells of midnight forests. A giant chalkboard stretches the length of the wall, displaying patient counts written in numerals that squirm, tadpole-like, across the surface. Every time you erase one, three more appear. It’s arithmetic bred from nightmare: subtract, multiply.

Suddenly a hush falls. Outside the glass walls, snowflakes the size of dinner plates begin to drift down, each flake containing flickering images—memories of the patients inside: a birthday cake, a piano recital, the birth of a child. The flakes melt as they hit the pavement, releasing aromas of vanilla frosting, cedarwood, and newborn skin. You feel your heart hitch at the reminder of why you’re fighting to keep strangers alive.

But supplies slide further toward nothingness. The oxygen gauges fall into the red. The emergency generator coughs like a dying dragon. You push through double doors into the loading dock. Freight trucks should be here—yet you find only a vast, moonlit harbor. Water laps at the concrete edge. A ferry of pale blue light glides toward you, piloted by a figure in coveralls stitched from hospital wristbands. Each band bears a different name. The figure signals wordlessly: Load the patients.

You return to the wards. Beds—if they can still be called that—now float inches above the floor, tethered by IV lines like balloon strings. Your voice booms through the corridors, reverberating with impossible acoustics: “Evacuation route is the loading dock! Follow the music!” And music does swell, inexplicably, from the ventilation shafts: a gentle waltz played on glass harmonica, notes tinkling like icicles.

Staff shepherd patients toward the dock. The nurse with galaxy eyes uses her pupils as lanterns, casting constellations onto walls to guide movement. In Pediatrics, you scoop up a toddler whose tears are tiny pearls; they roll off your sleeve and hatch into fireflies, illuminating the path.

The hospital itself seems to exhale relief as the last gurney crosses the threshold. Behind you, lights wink out room by room until the building’s silhouette is an empty husk against a bruised horizon. The ferry, radiant and silent, bears the patients across the mirrored harbor. You remain alone on the concrete, clipboard now feather-light, pages empty of ink.

A final quake rattles the earth. The hospital folds inward like an origami swan, compressing century-old brick and steel into a single white paper crane that flutters upward, joining the first pale glimmer of dawn. You watch as it catches a rising thermal and soars, impossibly graceful, into a sky turning lavender at the edges.

Sirens hush, replaced by the hush of wind through imaginary trees. The clipboard dissolves to sand, spilling through your fingers and away on the breeze. And you think, with the serene clarity that only dreams can conjure: Resources end, but imagination replenishes itself forever.

The ferry vanishes into the brightness at the horizon, and the world pulses once—like a giant heartbeat—and fades.

You wake, the ghost of aurora-blood still swirling behind your eyelids, the echo of glass-harmonica waltz lingering somewhere just beyond morning’s reach.
