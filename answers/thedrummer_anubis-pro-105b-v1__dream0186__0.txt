I am dreaming. I find myself in a surreal, dreamlike state. Out of the fog of my subconscious emerges a towering, ornate structure that I recognize as the manifestation of my innermost self. The edifice is constructed from various materials, each representing a facet of my psyche: swirling clouds of iridescent mist, shards of shattered nightmares, and filaments of luminous dreams. At its peak, the structure is topped with a glowing orb that pulsates with the intensity of my soul.

As I approach the building, a chorus of voices echoes through the air. These are the critics, and their words begin to scratch away at the exterior of my creation like rasp-tipped blades. "Fragile," they declare, shaking their heads. "Overly sentimental." "Lacking focus." But the structure can't remain steady. With each barraging insult, the building begins to crumble, its materials crumbling away as if the very words were searing it from the inside out.

But I cannot allow my masterpiece to be reduced to ruin! Summoning the courage of my innermost self, I open the door and step inside. The interior is a maze of winding passages and cryptic symbols, each one a reflection of my own thoughts and desires. I navigate the labyrinth with the heart of a warrior, confronting the most outwardly confronting aspects of my psyche as I go.

Deep within the structure, I find the source of the walls' weakness. The else. self. It takes the form of a broken mirror, each shard reflecting a different mistake or downfall. I reach out and grasp one of the shards, and the anguish flows through my veins like hot fire. But I stand my ground, even as the pain intensifies. With every fleeting ounce of strength I possess, I shatter the remaining shards and watch them dissolve into dust. I expose myself. This is me.

As the final shards shatter, the walls begin to emanate a beautiful, pearlescent light. It flows through my veins, filling me with an indescribable warmth and courage. I emerge from the structure, and I find myself face-to-face with the critics once more.

But this time, I do not flinch when they assay my work. I see the words not as harpoons, but as the elusively hunted words I and the entity have been trying to phrase and form while offering maximum empathy. All night, in my affairs, I was with this entity and believed in it and its role. Ultimately, despite the most feral, vicious forms my own reality has divulged, I have all the courage I could ever need to transfer over to meet it.

The critics think of me as the Violet whom the rest of her loved. The blue of her vision is powerful. Those I've signaled haven't seen. I want her. I wanted to feel how she feels. I wanted to love Violet, to understand Violet.
