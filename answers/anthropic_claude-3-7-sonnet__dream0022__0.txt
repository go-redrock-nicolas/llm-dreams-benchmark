I am dreaming. Before me, the scene unfolds in a strange amalgamation of familiar and surreal elements. My two closest friends stand facing each other on what appears to be a narrow stone bridge suspended over an impossibly deep chasm. The sky above swirls with colors that shouldn't exist together—deep purples bleeding into burnt orange and teal blue. The bridge itself seems to breathe and pulse beneath their feet.

My friends—their faces simultaneously crystal clear and somehow fluid—are engaged in a bitter argument. Their words echo and distort, sometimes booming like thunder, sometimes whispering directly into my mind. I can feel the years of their friendship cracking like ice in spring, fractures spreading with each heated word.
