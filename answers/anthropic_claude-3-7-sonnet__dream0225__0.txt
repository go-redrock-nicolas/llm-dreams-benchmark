I am dreaming. I find myself standing on an impossibly narrow bridge that stretches between two cosmic shores. The entire structure is crafted from crystalline light that hums beneath my feet with each step. Stars swirl both above and below me, creating the disorienting sensation that I'm suspended in the heart of a spinning galaxy. The air tastes like electricity and forgotten melodies.

Ahead, I see a gathering of figures whose forms shift between human and something gloriously indefinable. They are evaluating candidates for some cosmic position, and somehow I've been summoned here. The other aspirants around me radiate confidence—their bodies wrapped in shimmering symbols that mark them as masters of celestial mathematics, dreamweaving, and chronological architecture.

Looking down at myself, I see only ordinary hands, unadorned with the glyphs of expertise that the others wear so naturally. A woman with eyes like twin nebulae approaches me, her movements leaving trails of stardust.

"You must demonstrate mastery of memory extraction and timeline splicing," she announces, her voice somehow both inside and outside my head.

Panic rises as I realize I don't even understand what those disciplines entail, while my competitors materialize complex geometric patterns between their fingertips, clearly fluent in these cosmic arts.

My mundane memories, connections, and understandings are forming something new that captures the attention of the evaluators.
