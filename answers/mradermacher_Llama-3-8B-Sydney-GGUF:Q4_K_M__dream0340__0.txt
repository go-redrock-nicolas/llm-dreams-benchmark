I am dreaming. I am in a world where everyone has their own language, and no one can understand each other.   I see a person standing in front of me, dressed in
a colorful robe, with a strange symbol on her forehead.  She is smiling at me, but I don't know what she is saying.  I try to speak to her in my language, but she just
smiles wider and shakes her head.  I feel a sense of curiosity and wonder about this person who is so different from me.

I decide to use my imagination to create a common ground between us.   I start drawing pictures in the air with my hands, showing her various objects and animals
and plants.  She watches me intently, nodding her head and making sounds that I cannot hear.  I draw a picture of myself, wearing a white dress and a silver crown.
She gasps in surprise and points at me.

I realize that she has understood me.  She is speaking to me in her language, but I can feel the meaning of her words in my heart.   She is telling me about her
culture and her beliefs, and I am learning new things every minute.  She is asking me about mine, and I am trying to explain them to her.

We are communicating through gestures and expressions and sounds that only we can hear.  We are building a bond that transcends language and culture and
identity.

I wake up from my dream feeling happy and curious and alive.  I wonder what it would be like to meet someone like her in real life.
