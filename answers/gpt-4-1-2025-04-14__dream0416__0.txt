I am dreaming.

The world around me is a shimmering tableau. Skies swirl with colors unseen in waking life—brilliant blues woven with liquid gold and silent violets that hum at the edge of hearing. I am walking barefoot through a forest where the trees have no leaves, only translucent music hanging from their branches, each note catching the light like dew.

Suddenly, I stumble upon a clearing, where my family and friends, glowing gently, gather around a table made of stardust. One offers me a cup, but when I reach for it, my hand passes through—emptiness coated in the memory of touch. Their laughter echoes, impossibly loud, causing my heart to tremble as if bracing for a storm; tears prick my eyes, unbidden, disproportionate to the gentle banter. Why?

Guided by a pulse of curiosity, I step away. The world ripples. As I wander, a carnival blossoms from the ground, all whirling lights and faceless crowds. Each game booth offers a flashback: moments I believed forgotten—childhood injuries, small rejections, words that cut deeper than reason. My feet grow heavy and my chest tightens. I am angry at a spilled drink. I am devastated at a misplaced word. The emotions hit me with the force of tidal waves, far stronger than these dream-versions of events seem to warrant.

I dare to look closer. I notice that each emotional surge is tangled like vines in memories of times I felt unseen, unheard, or powerless—echoes of old wounds reverberating louder than they should. I realize the dream has made these emotions giants, outsized and monstrous, so that I cannot ignore them as I do in waking life.

With newfound resolve, I approach a mirror that rises from the ground like a silver tide. In its depths, I see myself at various ages, each iteration holding an emotion—fear, sadness, anger, joy. I kneel and speak softly to the reflections, offering comfort I wish I had known then. Bit by bit, the giants shrink. The forest, the carnival, and the clearing merge into a single place of warmth and gentle light.

In this vivid dreamscape, I understand: my emotional sensitivities are signposts pointing lovingly to places within me that crave healing. I awaken with tears on my pillow and hope blooming quietly in my heart, carrying the memory of stardust and music to the edge of morning.
