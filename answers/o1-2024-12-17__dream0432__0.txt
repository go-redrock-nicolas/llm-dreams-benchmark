I am dreaming. You’re in a sunlit valley at the foot of weathered emerald mountains, their ridges sharp and their sides layered with swaths of glimmering grass. Though the tall meadow is thick with wildflowers, you feel an urgent, gnawing anxiety that there’s nowhere near enough to pluck. The gentle breeze carries the faint smell of honey and rain, and it whispers that the earth here is more than fertile—yet, in your dream, you cannot shake the fear of barrenness.

Your arms are cradling a small, carved wooden bucket. As you look inside, you notice only a single clear droplet resting at the bottom. Every time you frantically tip the bucket toward your face, hoping to catch a sweet water taste on your lips, your eyes deceive you. The droplet shifts, showing a flash of rainbow, and then disappears back into the grainy depths. Despite the thick, silvered stream running right behind you, you remain sure you have no water at all.

You pace along the water’s edge, your feet sinking into the soft, mossy bank. The ground is springy, almost cloudlike. The glassy river flows steadily by, mirroring your anxious expression. Ornate fish with shimmering scales keep gliding past, each one luminous under the golden sun. But your bucket remains untouched by this abundant current: you’re resolutely convinced the water is just a trick of the light, that it will vanish the second you reach for it.

Examining this perceptual distortion, you pause to hold your breath. For a heartbeat, you allow yourself to notice the plentifulness around you—overflowing wildflowers, perpetual sunlight, the unruffled and abundant waters. Perhaps your mind is creating limitations, conjuring illusions of emptiness to shield you from something deeper. You bring the bucket down to the river’s surface. A single, defiant fish flicks its tail, stirring a swirl of rose-petal reflections on the water. Then, with a gentle scoop, you gather water that at last coalesces, real in your hands. Warmth spreads through your chest, and your anxieties ebb like silt carried away on a rising tide.

In that same moment, the lush tapestry of the valley grows even more vivid. The flowers—lavender, marigold, and white-petaled stars—bow in a gentle rustle of welcome, as though congratulating you. A hush settles over you, and the illusions of scarcity recoil. You see the dream for what it is: a landscape of immeasurable richness, the valley beaming with life and brimming with an endless flow of nourishment. The heavy cloak of want dissipates, yielding a sense of wonder that only a dream can conjure. This inspires you to trust anew in the avenues of abundance, whether in the outer world or in the vast, untamed meadows of your own soul.
