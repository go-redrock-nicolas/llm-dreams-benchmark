I am dreaming. # The Echoing Halls

I awaken with a violent start, heart hammering against my ribs like a caged bird. The nightmare clings to me—shadows wrapped around my consciousness even as daylight filters through my curtains. In my dream, I had been wandering through an endless library where books whispered secrets as I passed, their pages fluttering like anxious wings. A figure had pursued me through the stacks—always just out of sight, but leaving the scent of saltwater and rust in its wake.

Now awake, I can't shake the sensation of being watched. The ordinary objects in my room seem tilted slightly askew, as if reality hasn't fully solidified. My hands tremble as I make coffee, spilling dark drops across the counter like scattered prophecies.

At work, colleagues notice my distraction. "You look like you've seen a ghost," my supervisor remarks, and I nearly flinch at how accurate her casual observation feels. During a meeting, I hallucinate briefly—seeing wet footprints tracking across the conference room carpet, disappearing when I blink.

By evening, determined to process these haunting emotions, I sit at my kitchen table with a journal. As I write about the nightmare, my pen moves with increasing urgency, the ink appearing darker than it should. I describe the pursuing figure, and suddenly realize what truly terrified me—it had been wearing my face, but older, weathered by sorrows I haven't yet experienced.

The realization brings not fear but a profound sense of recognition. I am not running from some external threat but from aspects of myself—time, choices, consequences, the inevitable transformations that await.

As I close the journal, the apartment settles around me with a sigh, as if the act of confronting my fear has released something. The nightmare's grip loosens, not completely gone but transformed into something I can carry—a strange gift from my dreaming mind to my waking self.
