I am dreaming. Before me a great  parade moves slowly along, everyone somberly marching, drums tapping out a mournful beat. As I look around at the procession, I notice everyone dressed in the most elaborate of mourning attire - long black robes adorned with intricate lace, and black veils reaching down to the ground. The air is filled with the scent of incense that burns in tall silver censors carried by hooded figures.

A steady beat of a drum, and my heart, however, are in stark contrast with the overwhelming desire to laugh that is bubbling up inside. The funny thought of a group of squirrels performing a synchronized dance to this funeral march plays out in my mind, and I stifle a snicker.  The more I try to suppress it, the funnier it feels– it’s maddening. I try to get a handle on this rebellious reaction even as my eyes start to tear up.

Then, the procession stops. A hush falls over the crowd and the squirrels in my head mercifully pause mid-twirl. The silence is broken by the reverberating sound of a gong and all eyes turned towards the sky. The night has turned into a Disneyland of stars. Shooting stars flash and streak, painting ephemeral designs in the dark sky, flowers of fire that bloom and fade in an instant. It’s a mesmerizing dazzling fireworks display on a galactic level. 

The tightness in my chest from the suppressed laugh eases as awe takes its place– a smile on my face seems entirely appropriate now. I gaze upward, lost in the unfolding beauty and for a moment, I'm one with the universe.

In this fluid way of dreams, suddenly, I have a paintbrush in my hand. Like some cosmic artist, I sweep the brush across the heavens and a streak of purple paint spills out into the darkness, igniting into a thousand shades of lavender, plum and violet. Now a yellow stroke, and the sky fills with amber and golden hues. Streak after streak, the sky becomes a riot of colors– cerulean blues, ruby reds, emerald greens. Swirling and shifting, melting and merging, they form a breath-taking celestial tapestry.

Drawn deeper into this dream, I find a sense of profound peace washing over me, a connection to some universal truth. The vibrant heavens dance on, and I am at the center, grounded yet soaring,  awash in color and light.
