I am dreaming. I am floating through a twilight sky spun from violet clouds, each wisp humming with distant laughter. Beneath me, a sea of molten glass ripples in slow motion, reflecting impossible constellations: eyes that pulse with silent longing, hands reaching out and then retreating into the depths. I drift toward a grand marble plaza whose pillars swirl like living wood; their bark coils upward, blossoming into bronze leaves that tremble whenever I draw near.

At the center of this plaza stands a congregation of benefactors—men and women robed in pearlescent gowns that catch the dying light. Their voices rise in harmonies of gratitude, each pledge of kindness echoing like a solemn vow. A hush settles over the crowd as one figure steps forward, smiling with such earnest purity that even the moonlight seems to linger on her lips.

She raises a gilded chalice, proclaiming, “I offer this gift with no thought for praise—only the world’s burdens lie heavy upon my heart.” But in that instant, the plaza’s glass floor shatters into a thousand fractal mirrors. Each mirror lifts and floats around her, revealing shadowy projections at her feet. In one reflection, she stands triumphant on a dais, draped in the adoration of silent crowds. In another, she clutches the chalice as though it were a lonely child begging to be noticed.  

I sense a tremor pass through the entire tableau: every act of charity morphs into a play for recognition, every gentle word shows a glimmer of self rewarded. The benefactors’ gowns shift color—pearl to rust to coal—as though peeled back layer by layer, revealing the iron machinery of desire ticking within their chests. Their voices waver between service and survival, between kindness and a hunger for legacy.

Suddenly, the plaza tilts. I spill into a corridor lined with portraits whose eyes follow me: kings who built hospitals to secure their lineage, poets who wove odes of compassion to immortalize their own names, strangers who emptied their purses so that tales of their generosity would outlive sorrow itself. A cold wind whispers in my ear: “Even altruism demands a witness.”

I stumble into a vast cathedral of stained glass that depicts saints of charity. Each panel refracts into a kaleidoscope of motives—ambition, vanity, fear of insignificance. I press my hand against the colored light, and it burns with the truth I’ve always known: that behind every philanthropic gesture lies the inescapable gravity of self.  

As the dream dissolves, the sound of distant laughter returns—a reminder that even this revelation, this final unmasking, serves the deepest self-interest: the desire to believe I alone have pierced through the grand illusion. And with that thought, I wake, carrying the echo of mirrored souls and the fragile promise that perhaps even my cynicism exists to affirm my own keen sight.
