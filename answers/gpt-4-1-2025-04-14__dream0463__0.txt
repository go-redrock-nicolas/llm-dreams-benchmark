I am dreaming.

The world is soft and tinged with a thousand shades of violet and gold, like the first brush of sunlight on the deepest lake at dawn. I stand within a hall of mirrors—each pane warped, curving my image into strange, unfamiliar shapes. The floor beneath my feet is shifting sand, warm and scenting faintly of lavender and unknown spices. In the corners of the room, faint whispers curl upward like ethereal smoke, voices blending into a chorus of half-remembered faces from my waking life.

I move through the hall, heart thundering with every step, eyes searching for something I can almost touch: that one approving smile, that gentle nod, that glimmer of acceptance. Each time I reach out, the approval retreats behind another pane of glass, another mask worn by someone aloof, their gaze cool and distant. I perform, offer gifts, shrink myself, stand taller—doing every trick I know, but always met with the silent shake of a head, a flutter of disinterest.

Suddenly, the mirrors pulse and waver as if made of water. The whispers rise to a roar, words tumbling over one another: “Why do you seek what they will not give? Why twist yourself to fit a mold that only shrinks your fire?” The glass melts away, dissolving into starlight, revealing a forest full of phosphorescent trees whose leaves hum with quiet magic. The air is thick with the scent of rain and promise.

A gentle hand—a version of myself, unburdened, radiant with hidden light—steps from between the glowing trees. She looks at me, not with judgment, but with boundless compassion. She opens her arms. “Let your own heart be your lantern. Approve of yourself. Watch what grows.”

As I step toward her, roots spring up beneath my feet, strong and glowing, anchoring me while a wild garden bursts into being around us. The faces that once withheld approval dissolve, their power waning like mist in the morning sun. I see clearly: the approval I sought like a draught in the desert was always just a shadow play—a distraction from the wellspring of warmth already inside me.

In this vivid dream, I finally break the cycle, reclaiming my power among the shifting landscapes of my deepest mind. Approval radiates outward, boundless, unfettered; I am home.
