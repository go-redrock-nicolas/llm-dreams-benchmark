I am dreaming. I slip into the dream as if stepping through a film reel: one moment I’m standing on firm ground, the next I’m poised atop a vast translucent platform suspended in a lavender sky. Beneath me stretches a sea of silvery mist, and all around the horizon blossoms with floating spires that pulse with soft emerald light. In my hands I hold a slender baton made of spun moonlight—it’s the key to the operation I must oversee.

Before me, eight enormous crystalline tubes arch upward like the ribs of some gargantuan leviathan. Each tube contains a different element—liquid starlight, humming ether, shifting sands of time—and all eight must release their contents in perfect sequence. The moment each droplet is unleashed, it will join a swirling vortex at the platform’s center, forging a new constellation of energy that will stabilize the dreamworld’s fragile balance.

At first, everything proceeds as planned. My baton glows in my grip, each flick of my wrist sending a soft chime through the air. Tube one drips a vein of molten gold. Tube two replies in gentle lavender, tube three in shimmering indigo. I feel a quiet thrill, like the world itself is breathing in time with my pulse.

But then—without warning—an electric crack reverberates through the sky. A ripple of violet storm clouds rips across the horizon, and the tubes begin to vibrate. In the haze a new variable emerges: tiny motes of black moon-dust, drawn by the storm’s charge, start drifting into the open ends of the tubes. If even one mote slips inside, it will poison that element, and the entire constellation will collapse.

My heart hammers. I glance at the sequencer displays hovering in midair: the timing is down to milliseconds now. I have to act. The world tilts, and for a moment I’m weightless—then I catch my balance and plant my feet firmly on the platform.

I raise the baton high. Its light flares into a beacon, and I let the calm settle over me like silk. In that still point I sense the tubes’ own heartbeat. Whispering to them, I redirect the starlight to form protective halos around each opening, just as the black motes surge forward. They crash against the shields and shatter like fragile glass, dissolving into harmless sparks that swirl away.

With the threat contained, the timing kicks back in. I lower the baton, welcome the trembling hum in my ears, and tap out the final three beats. Tube six exhales a ribbon of opal radiance. Tube seven sighs in pale turquoise. Tube eight bursts open in a blaze of rose-gold brilliance—and all eight streams spiral together in a slow-motion dance, coalescing above the vortex into a living star.

A hush falls over everything. The lavender sky softens to bloom-pink, the floating spires hum a gentle lullaby, and the platform beneath my feet warms with the promise of new balance. As the fresh constellation settles into the heavens, I breathe in relief and wonder—and feel the dream shift beneath me, richer and steadier than before, as if the very act of saving it has given it deeper life.
