I am dreaming. You plunge into the dream as though diving from a cliff’s edge into a liquid sky. All around you, the air is alive with the hum of color—emerald gusts swirl with molten gold, and every breath tastes of lilac and old paper. You wander through a forest of towering glass ferns whose fronds shimmer in perfect silver resonance. When you reach out to touch one, it bends and sings a high, crystalline note that echoes like laughter down the tree trunks.  

But then the forest floor, which a moment ago felt like soft moss, gives way beneath your foot. You tumble into a hollow carved from the roots of a giant glass beech, and a sharp jab of pain shoots through your ankle—an electric scream of agony. Instinctively, your lips quirk into a wry grin and you blurt, “Well, that’s one way to break the ice!” A tiny burst of nervous laughter slips out, despite the fire licking at your nerves.  

In that fractured instant of levity, something inside you nudges awake. You realize the joke was your shield, conjured to ward off the sting. You sense a younger part of yourself cowering behind the humor, afraid to face the raw, humming ache. And so—in the living, breathing theater of this dream—you stop laughing. You cradle your throbbing ankle with both hands and allow the pain its full voice: a jagged, urgent message rather than an insult to your dignity.   

As you do, the glass ferns lean in, their hum shifting from laughter to a deeper tone, as if offering compassion. Their silver fronds bend gently, forming a cradle of shimmering light beneath your twisted leg. You feel astonished tenderness course through you, replacing the fluttery shell of humor with something real and grounding. You close your eyes and sink into the subtle embrace of pain’s honesty. In its place rises a soft, steady warmth—understanding that laughing at hurt was once a way to hide, but here and now, you choose to feel.  

With that choice, the forest around you responds. The liquid sky ripples, colors blending into a serene lavender dusk. You stand, supported by the luminous fronds, and take a careful step. The pain remains, but it no longer terrifies you. You carry it as an old scar carries its own story. And in this dream’s gentle afterglow, you walk on—aware, whole, and no longer afraid to let every sensation, painful or sweet, have its honest voice.
