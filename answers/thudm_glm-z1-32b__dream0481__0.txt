I am dreaming. I am in a vast crystal cavern, the walls glinting with prismatic reflections that dance like liquid light.  My bare feet press against cool, smooth stones that pulse rhythmically beneath me, responding to some cosmic heartbeat.  The air smells of petrichor and wildflowers after rain, even though there isn't a cloud in sight - or maybe the clouds are all made of<beginofsentence># Quadratic Equation Problems

**Instructions for Solving:**

1. Show all your work step-by-step.
2. Circle or box your final answers.
3. Provide detailed explanations for each step.
4. Use proper mathematical notation and formatting.
**Problem 1: \(2x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0\)**

1. **Discriminant**:  
   \(D = (-4)^2 - 4(2)(1) = 16 - 8 = \boxed{8}\)

2. **Nature of Roots**:  
   \(D > 0\), so roots are **real and distinct**.

3. **Roots Using Quadratic Formula**:  
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{8}}{2(2)} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2}}{2} = \boxed{1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
   \]

**Problem 2: \(f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5\)**

1. **Vertex**:  
   \(x = -\frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3\).  
   \(f(3) = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4\).  
   Vertex: \(\boxed{(3, -4)}\)

2. **x-intercepts**:  
   \(x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \Rightarrow (x-1)(x-5) = 0\).  
   Intercepts: \(\boxed{x = 1 \text{ and } x = 5}\)

3. **Range**:  
   Opens upward, so \(y \geq -4\).  
   Range: \(\boxed{[-4, \infty)}\)

---

**Problem 3: Ball Height \(h(t) = -5t^2 + 20t + 20\)**

1. **Time to Hit Ground**:  
   \(-5t^2 + 20t + 20 = 0\).  
   Solve: \(t = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 400}}{-10} = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\).  
   Positive root: \(\boxed{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) seconds (\(\approx 4.83\) s).

2. **Maximum Height**:  
   Vertex at \(t = -\frac{20}{2(-5)} = 2\).  
   \(h(2) = -20 + 40 + 20 = \boxed{40}\) meters.

---

**Problem 4: \(x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\)**

- **Algebraically**:  
  \((x-1)(x-3) = 0 \Rightarrow \boxed{x = 1 \text{ and } x = 3}\).  
- **Graphically**: Parabola intersects x-axis at \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\).

---

**Problem 5: Quadratic with Roots \(\alpha = 2\), \(\beta = -3\)**  
\[
(x-2)(x+3) = x^2 + x - 6 = \boxed{x^2 + x - 6 = 0}
