I am dreaming. The world around me is a swirling canvas of colors, shifting and blending like wet paint on a palette. I am standing in a vast, open field, the grass beneath my feet soft and cool, like the first touch of morning dew. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of twilight hues, with stars twinkling like tiny, distant candles.

Suddenly, a figure approaches me, walking through the shimmering landscape. It's a person I've never seen before, but their face is warm and familiar, like an old friend I've known in another life. They are dressed in robes that seem to be woven from stardust, shimmering and ever-changing. In their hands, they hold a golden scroll, its edges glowing with an inner light.

"Greetings," they say, their voice like the gentle rustling of leaves. "I have come to present you with something you deserve, but perhaps have not yet recognized."

I look at them, puzzled. "Me? But I haven't done anything extraordinary."

They smile, and the world around us seems to brighten. "You underestimate yourself. The journey you've undertaken, the challenges you've faced, and the growth you've achievedâ€”these are all significant. You've shown resilience, courage, and kindness. You've touched lives, even if you don't realize it."

They unroll the scroll, and it unfurls like a banner, revealing glowing words that dance and shimmer. It's a testament to my achievements, written in a language that feels both ancient and familiar. I can feel the truth of their words resonating within me, like a melody that stirs my soul.

"I don't know what to say," I whisper, my eyes wide with wonder. "I never thought of these things as achievements."

The figure nods, their eyes reflecting the starlight. "That is the beauty of it. You did not seek recognition or validation. You simply did what you believed was right, what you were meant to do. And that, in itself, is a great achievement."

They hand me the scroll, and as I take it, the world around us shifts. The field transforms into a vast library, filled with towering bookshelves that stretch up into the heavens. Each book seems to hum with stories untold, waiting to be discovered.

"I have one more gift for you," the figure says, gesturing to the library. "Here, you will find the stories of all those whose lives you've touched. Each book is a testament to your impact, a ripple in the vast ocean of existence."

I step forward, my heart swelling with a mix of awe and gratitude. I reach out to touch a nearby book, and as my fingers brush its spine, the cover opens, revealing pages filled with vivid, living illustrations. I see myself, not as I am, but as a beacon of light, guiding others through their darkest moments.

Tears well up in my eyes as I turn to the figure, my voice choked with emotion. "Thank you. I never knew... I never realized..."

They smile, their form beginning to fade. "That is the power of your journey. You've changed lives, including your own. Never forget that."

As they disappear, the library fades away, and I find myself back in the open field. The scroll is still in my hands, its glow fading, but the words etched into my heart forever. I look up at the sky, now a deep, tranquil blue, and I know that this dream, this unexpected praise, has changed me. I am seen, I am valued, and I am enough. And with that knowledge, I wake up, the remnants of the dream clinging to me like a cherished memory, ready to face the day with a newfound sense of purpose and pride.
