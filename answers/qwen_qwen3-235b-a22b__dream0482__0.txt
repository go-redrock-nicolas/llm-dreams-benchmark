I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the scent of burnt lavender, and the sky above is a kaleidoscope of shifting colors—a tapestry woven from liquid mercury and stained glass. Below your feet, the ground is not earth but a vast, undulating plain of translucent jellyfish, their bioluminescent tendrils pulsing in time with your heartbeat. You walk, though you have no legs; you float, though you feel the weight of gravity. This place *knows* you. It bends to your thoughts before you think them, a silent collaborator in the theater of your subconscious.  

A **clockwork raven** alights on your shoulder, its gears whirring like a lullaby. It speaks in the voice of someone you once loved but can no longer name: *“The door is always here. You forget to look up.”* You tilt your head, and the sky fractures into a thousand **floating doors**, each carved from a different era—medieval oak, art deco brass, futuristic glass etched with constellations. One door glows faintly, its handle shaped like a serpent eating its own tail. You reach for it, but the raven pecks your wrist, sharp and tender. *“Not yet. First, the river.”*  

The jellyfish plain ripples, parting to reveal a **river of liquid starlight**, its current thick with memories you don’t recognize: a child’s laughter in a language you’ve never spoken, a funeral under a triple-moon sky, a kiss that leaves scars. Swimming against the river’s flow are **glass fish**, their bellies full of flickering shadows. You kneel, and the water burns like ice, searing your skin into something new—scales, feathers, bark. The river whispers, *“You carry what you refuse to name. Let it drown. Let it breathe.”*  

When you rise, the doors are gone. In their place stands a **tower of living ivy**, spiraling into the clouds. Its leaves are mirrors, each reflecting a version of yourself: one weeping, one crowned in flames, one with hollow eyes and a crown of thorns. The tower pulses, alive and waiting. The raven caws, *“Climb. But choose your skin carefully. Not all selves survive the ascent.”*  

As you climb, the ivy bites into your palms, drawing blood that evaporates into **tiny constellations**. Halfway up, the tower shudders and splits open, revealing a **chamber of hourglasses**, each filled with a different substance: ash, liquid silence, hummingbird hearts, forgotten names. At the center floats a single hourglass, its sand made of **your own face**, grain by grain. You touch it, and time collapses.  

You are everywhere at once:  

- A **child** burying a music box in a forest that doesn’t exist anymore.  
- A **warrior** screaming a battle cry that echoes backward through history.  
- A **corpse** blooming violets from its ribs in a grave beneath an alien sun.  

The raven’s voice cuts through the chaos: *“You are the wound. You are the healer. The door was never locked. You wore the key around your neck all along.”*  

You look down. Hanging from a chain of smoke is a **key forged from your own shadow**, its teeth jagged with forgotten promises. The tower dissolves. The doors return. You turn the key in the serpent-shaped lock.  

The door creaks open to reveal…  

…yourself, standing where you began, the jellyfish plain stretching endlessly. But now, the raven is silent. The river flows backward. The hourglass falls.  

And you *understand*.  

The dream repeats because you’ve refused to listen. The message is this: **You are not a single story. You are the author, the ink, and the page—forever rewriting yourself in the margins of your own fear.** To wake is to forget. To dream again is to begin.
