I am dreaming. In the heart of a once-thriving, now forgotten city, I find myself wandering through the labyrinthine catacombs, a place untouched by time and the elements. The air is a blanket of damp and decay, heavy with the perfume of centuries-old earth and the faintest tang of salt from a distant sea. The walls of this subterranean world are lined with sarcophagi and crypts, their marble surfaces etched with the names and stories of those who have long since turned to dust. Motes of golden dust dance around me, caught in the_SWirling light from my flickering torch, which casts eerie, writhing shadows onto the cold stone walls.

The passage is narrow, and I brush against the rough-hewn stone, feeling the history seep into my fingertips. The acoustics are peculiar, and my footsteps echo in a dance of distant clatters and muffled thuds, as if the very bones of the earth resonate with my passing. The silence is not a void, but heavy with whispers and echoes of the past - the muttered prayers of the long-dead, the scurrying of unseen creatures in the depths, and the distant, unnerving drip-drip-drip of water from some unseen cavern.

The torch flickers unpredictably, its flame shrinking and growing with each gust of the cold, whispering breeze that seems to follow me from the deep. I hug the wall, feeling my way along its uneven surface, praying that the light does not fail me entirely in this lightless tomb. The shadows grow darker, encroaching on my world with each faltering breath of the flame, and I feel a shiver run down my spine, not from the cold, but from the primal fear that clings to these ancient depths.

Rounding a bend, I stumble into a vast chamber. The torch flickers wildly, its light dancing crazily across the room, revealing a forest of columns, carved with intricate scenes of gods and heroes. The ceiling, far above, is lost in darkness, but I can make out the silhouettes of stalactites,US like the teeth of some vast, slumbering beast. The floor is inscribed with a complex mosaic, depicting a celestial map of stars and constellations, the tiles worn smooth by the passage of untold generations of the restless dead.

But my attention is drawn to the centre of the chamber, where a massive sarcophagus lies open, its occupant missing. A gust of wind from some hidden vent extinguishes the flame of my torch. I am plunged into darkness, the torch holder falling from my numbed fingers. Panic claws at my chest, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps. I am alive, but I might as well be one of the corpses buried here, for I am blind and lost, a heartbeat in the infinite silence of the ancient, the unknown, the forgotten.
