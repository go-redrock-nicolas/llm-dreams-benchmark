I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinth of glass corridors that spiral through a suspended city. The twilight sky bleeds colors I cannot name—hues that exist between purple and green, between sunset and dawn. My footsteps echo with hollow resonance as I walk past doorways filled with gatherings of shadowy figures, their laughter and conversation spilling out into the passageways.

Though I recognize some faces, I continue walking past each entrance. My hand rises involuntarily to wave, but I never stop. Inside, a hollow ache expands beneath my ribs—a yearning to join them, to feel the warmth of connection.

The corridor narrows, and suddenly the glass beneath my feet turns to water. I'm walking on the surface of a vast, midnight lake that reflects constellations I've never seen before. Each step sends ripples outward, disturbing the perfect mirror of stars. In the distance, I see a floating island where everyone I've ever known mingles beneath lanterns that glow like captured fireflies.

"Why don't you join us?" they call, their voices carrying across the water like music.

But something invisible tethers me to the shore—a weight of unspoken fears, of vulnerability, of the effort required to bridge the gap. The contradiction tears at me: the desperate need to connect and the instinctive retreat from it.

The water beneath my feet begins to form into a boat made of memories—childhood laughter, shared secrets, tender embraces—all solidifying into a vessel that could carry me across. As I hesitantly step aboard, I realize the distance to the island isn't as vast as it appeared.

The dream shifts, and I am already halfway there, the journey easier than my fears had led me to believe.
