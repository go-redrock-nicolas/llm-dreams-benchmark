I am dreaming. The room around me is vast and cavernous, its walls lined with towering bookshelves that stretch into a ceiling lost in shadow. The air hums with an eerie, electric tension, thick enough to press against my skin like unseen fingers. The panelists sit behind a long mahogany table, their faces obscured by shifting veils of mist—every time I try to focus on them, their features blur further, leaving only piercing gazes that seem to bore straight through me.  

I place my trembling hands on my research notes, the parchment warm as living flesh under my fingertips. But as I flip through the pages, my stomach plummets. The text is unraveling, letters twisting like worms, rearranging themselves into gibberish before my eyes. Diagrams melt, ink spreading like black veins across the paper, distorting the years of meticulous work into a grotesque, incomprehensible mess.  

A low, resonant chuckle rings through the air—the sound of distant thunder. One panelist leans forward, their voice smooth as oil yet sharp as broken glass. "Is *this* what you’ve spent your life on? A fever dream scribbled in smoke?"  

Panic tightens my throat, but when I try to speak, my breath comes out as silvery moths, fluttering toward the unseen ceiling. The room wobbles like water, the floor dipping beneath my feet. And then—I notice something shifting in the margins of my ruined notes. A word repeats, growing bolder, darker:  

*Wake.*  

Then louder—**WAKE.**  

The panelists rise as one, their silhouettes elongating, stretching toward me like hungry shadows—  

My eyes fly open. The dream dissolves. But my heart still pounds with the certainty that somewhere, in some other layer of existence, they’re still waiting for me to finish my presentation.
