I am dreaming. You're caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire with no clear escape route. As smoke thickens and flames approach from multiple directions, you realize that your only hope is to jump into a nearby river. With courage and determination, you make a leap of faith and plunge into the water below.

You wake up in shock but relieved. 

Your dream was about me.
