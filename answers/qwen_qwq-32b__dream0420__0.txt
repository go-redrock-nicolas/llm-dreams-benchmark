I am dreaming. I am standing in a boundless meadow of iridescent grass that shifts colors with every breeze. Above me is a twilight sky with three moons: one the traditional silver, another glowing a molten gold, and the third pulsing with bioluminescent violet. My hands are pressed against the soil, and when I pull them away, the ground beneath me ripples like water, revealing a labyrinth of glass tunnels leading downward.

A voice, both familiar and alien, murmurs, *"You have outgrown the cage of your old name."* I follow the tunnels that refract light into rainbows dancing on the walls. In the center of the maze is a obsidian throne where an aged version of myself sits, holding a silver mirror etched with constellations. 

When we meet, the reflection shows me not as I am now, but as the child who believed they were "not enough"â€”too quiet, too small, too plain. The elder self smiles and offers the mirror. As I touch it, the etchings come alive, swirling into scenes of my life where I hesitated to speak, shrank from opportunities, let others overshadow me. 

*"Shatter it,"* the voice commands. Hesitant, I strike the mirror against the throne. The shards morph into thousands of fireflies, each carrying a fragment of that old identity. They ascend through the tunnels, igniting the underground rivers into liquid starlight. 

Emerging back into the meadow, the moons now spin in a celebratory dance. My breath visible in the cool air, I speak words I never thought possible: *"I am vast."* The ground beneath me explodes in a crescendo of blossoms, their petals spelling words like courage, radiance, and wildness.
