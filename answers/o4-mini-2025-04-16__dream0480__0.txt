I am dreaming. I drift into a moonlit glade where silvery fog coils around my ankles like gentle serpents. The trees here breathe in slow, deliberate bellows, their leaves flickering between emerald and violet—as if they can’t decide which side of themselves to show. In my hand I clutch a mask of woven steel, cold and carved with features I know aren’t mine. Voices swirl overhead: some whispering encouragement to toss it aside, others insisting I fasten it tighter, “blend in,” “fit the mold,” “don’t scare them.” Each breath tastes of ozone and anticipation.  

When I slip the mask off, my reflection shivers in a pool of liquid mercury at my feet. The moment it touches the surface, ripples explode like silent fireworks, scattering shards of mirror that rise into the sky to form a shifting constellation—my face, half-smiling, half-frowning, constantly rearranging. Around me, a carnival springs to life: stalls draped in iridescent cloth, each offering a different suit of clothes. One booth insists on charcoal-grey jackets with polished buttons; another whispers of rainbow silks that hum with my heartbeat.  

Drawn toward the silks, I try one on and feel warmth unfurling in my chest. The fabric undulates with every pulse, etching my laughter into its threads. But across the midway, I glimpse a booth of uniform grey once more—behind its counter stands a faceless judge, arms crossed. The judge’s gaze slices through the carnival lights, and I feel the old weight settle into my shoulders: the fear of standing out, of being “too much” or “not enough.”  

I wander away, heart pounding, until the carnival dissolves beneath my feet and I’m perched on a balcony of white marble, overlooking a city made of glass spires. Each tower is crowned by a different colored lantern—blue, amber, crimson—yet they all shine through the same pale dawn. A wind rises, carrying distant applause. It’s hard to tell if it’s celebration or judgment, but it rouses something fierce inside me. I press my palm to the marble’s cool edge and close my eyes, inhaling courage like perfume.  

When I open them again, the glass spires have bowed toward me, lanterns dancing in unity. My carnival silks have drifted here, swirling around my ankles in a living waltz. The faceless judge reappears—this time in a grey cloak stitched with threads of every color—and steps back, nodding. My own voice rises, echoing across the city: a clear bell tone that carries every facet of me, loud enough to dissolve fog, to crack the steel mask at my feet. As dawn light floods in, I wake with my heart still humming, certain that somewhere between conformity and true self lies the raw, unbridled power of being wholly myself.
