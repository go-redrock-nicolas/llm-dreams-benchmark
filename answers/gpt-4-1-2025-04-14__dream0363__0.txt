I am dreaming.

I am walking through a twisting corridor of glass, suspended in the sky. Shards of memory float by, caught in the walls—shimmering images: a friend’s betrayal, a harsh word from a loved one, moments when I bit down on my own sharp retorts. The air is cool, almost electric. Each step echoes, as if the corridor is listening. I have been holding onto my anger for so long that it flickers in my chest like a trapped moth.

Suddenly, the glass starts to tremble from some deep, silent thunder. My suppressed fury, for so long just a faint ache, swells into a storm. In the dream, it becomes fire—leaping from my hands, streaming through my veins, golden and hot. The corridor’s clear surfaces fracture, spiderwebbing in intricate patterns that look less like destruction and more like revelation. Light pours through.

I stand at a fork in the corridor. One path is shrouded in shadow—a maze of dead ends. The other is veiled in a roaring wind, toward an open window. My anger won’t let me remain still. I run, the howling wind stirring up a cyclone of leaves, pages, and bits of colored glass around me. My breath comes loud, fierce. 

At the window’s edge, the anger pulses, raw and wild. Instead of recoiling, I let it move through me, fill me, illuminate the space inside that pain left behind. I do not shout or lash out. Instead, I gather the flame within and press my palm to the cold glass. It melts, not with violence, but with the warmth of acknowledgment. The window dissolves. I step through, out into an endless field beneath dusky, violet clouds, the air suddenly crisp and clean.

The anger, now named and honored, dissolves into the wind—leaving me lighter, braver. I understand: only by allowing the truth of my rage to surface could I transform it, shaping it into a doorway rather than a locked room. As the dream drifts, the field stretches before me—spacious, golden, and free.
