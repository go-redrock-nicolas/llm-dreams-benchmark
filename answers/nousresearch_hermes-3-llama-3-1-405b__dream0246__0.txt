I am dreaming. I find myself caught in avalanche terrain with unstable snow conditions deteriorating rapidly.  Around me, the world is washed in stark white, the sun glaring off the snowy peaks so brightly that it makes my eyes tear up.  The air is so cold that it feels like needles against my skin, and each breath forms frosty clouds around my face.

As fissures begin forming beneath my feet and the mountainside trembles, I reach out instinctively and try to grab hold of something, anything to steady myself.  But my gloved hands find no purchase in the shifting snow.  My heart is pounding, thudding against my ribcage like a wild bird trying to break free.

Suddenly, the snow gives way beneath me and I am tumbling down the mountainside, caught in the roiling heart of the avalanche.  My world turns upside down, blinding white and deafeningly loud, like being trapped in the center of a blizzard.  I am tossed about like a rag doll, powerless against the awesome force of the snow.

I am sure that I am about to die, but just as suddenly as it began, the movement stops.  I blink in the sudden stillness, my breath coming in harsh gasps.  Somehow, impossibly, I am alive.  The snow around me is packed solid, but I manage to claw my way out, each movement a brutal effort.

Finally, I break free, gulping in great lungfuls of the icy air.  I stand at the base of the mountain, looking back up at where I came from.  The mountainside is scored and raw-looking where the avalanche tore through, a vivid reminder of the power of nature.

But I am alive, and the world around me is so bright and sharp that it almost hurts.  The sky is a brilliant, aching blue, and the sun glints off the snow like flecks of gold.  I am shaking, my muscles aching, but I am alive.  And somehow, despite everything, the world is beautiful.
