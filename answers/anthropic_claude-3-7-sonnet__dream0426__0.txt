I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a glass bridge, suspended between two towering cliffs of shimmering amethyst. Below me, a sea of clouds churns in slow motion, occasionally revealing glimpses of an impossible landscape—cities built upside-down, forests growing sideways. The air tastes like memories I've never had.

A figure waits at the other end of the bridge—someone whose face shifts between those I love, those I've lost, and those I've yet to meet. They extend their hand expectantly, and I feel the familiar weight in my arms: a glowing orb containing fragments of myself—my time, my desires, my boundaries, my truth—all wrapped in gossamer threads.

I've crossed this bridge a thousand times before, each crossing leaving the orb a little dimmer, my steps a little heavier. The ritual is always the same: I surrender a piece of myself, the figure smiles, the bridge remains intact, connecting us for another day.

But tonight, something has changed. The orb pulses with sudden urgency against my chest. I look down and see hairline fractures spreading across the glass beneath my feet, each one corresponding to a compromise I've made that hollowed me out rather than brought me closer.

I step back. The figure's expression flickers between confusion and alarm. For the first time, I notice vines of crystalline flowers growing between the cracks in the bridge—not signs of damage, but of transformation.

I cradle the orb close and whisper, "No more." The words echo strangely, gaining substance and color as they ripple outward. The bridge doesn't collapse as I feared—instead, it begins to widen, strengthen, reshape itself into something new.

The figure across the way is changing too, becoming more solid, more real, as I hold my ground. We can still connect, but not at the cost of my dissolution.

The clouds below part, revealing not an abyss, but gardens and pathways I never knew existed—possibilities that open when sacrifice becomes sacred exchange rather than self-erasure.
