I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a moonlit meadow that shimmers with liquid starlight. Each blade of grass is tipped in opalescent dew, singing as you brush past. Far above, clouds part to reveal a colossal, silver-veined moon, its surface rippling like quicksilver. You walk, barefoot, feeling the soft pulse of the earth beneath you—an invitation to follow wherever your heart leads.

At the meadow’s center, two towering figures stand on a dais formed of living vines and midnight blossoms. To your left perches a great golden owl, wings unfurled in quiet majesty; its eyes glow with knowing amber light. To your right coils a sinuous silver serpent whose scales glint like falling tears of mercury; its tongue flicks out in a hissing whisper of rational counsel.

The owl speaks first. Its voice is a gentle thunder: “Trust the compass within your chest. Let your pulse be your guide. Do not stray into paths that leave your soul cold.” When it speaks, the world around you hums in resonance—flowers tilt toward you, and the breeze carries the faint scent of honeysuckle and cinnamon.

Then the serpent unfurls its body in a slow, hypnotic spiral. Its voice is smooth as polished steel: “Emotion is a fickle captain. Logic charts a safer course. Follow my counsel and you will avoid hazard and heartbreak.” With each sibilant syllable, the night air cools; distant stars retreat behind drifting curtains of fog.

You feel the bird’s warm assurance stirring in your heart, urging you to leap across an abyss of doubt. Yet beneath it, the serpent’s calculated promise weighs on your mind, promising certainty and security. You taste fear—fear of regret if you ignore either call.

Closing your eyes, you sink to one knee on the dewy dais. The moonlight pools around you, forming a silvery mirror on which your face appears twice: one reflection calm and bright, the other tense and shadowed. You recall how your pulse quickens when you dare to follow your own spark of inspiration, and how your thoughts quiet into steady purpose when you heed reason’s measured voice.

A single drop of dew falls from the owl’s beak into your palm, warm and alive. At the same moment, the serpent presses a polished obsidian scale into your other hand—cool, unyielding, heavy with promise. You lift them both to your chest.

In that heartbeat of stillness, you realize true guidance lies not in choosing one alone but in listening to both, in letting intuition paint the broad strokes and reason fill in the details. You stand and raise owl and serpent high; their forms merge, transforming into a brilliant phoenix of moonlight and steel. Its wings beat in a rhythm that is at once your heartbeat and your steady breath.

Awakening in that dream, you feel whole—armed with the courage of your heart and the clarity of your mind, ready at last to walk your path.
