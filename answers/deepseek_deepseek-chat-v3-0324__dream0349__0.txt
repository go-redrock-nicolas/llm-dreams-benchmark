I am dreaming. The air around me hums with a golden, syrupy light, thick as honey and just as sweet. I stand in a vast, open hall with walls that stretch into infinity, their surfaces covered in shifting mosaics of stained glass—each fragment a memory, a choice, a moment I’ve lived but never thought twice about. The floor is cool marble, veined with threads of liquid silver that pulse like veins, alive beneath my bare feet.  

Then, the voices begin.  

They come from everywhere and nowhere, resonant and warm, wrapping around me like sunlight after a long winter. *"You did it,"* they murmur, not in words but in something deeper—a vibration that moves through my bones. *"You carried kindness when no one was looking. You held space for joy in the quietest moments. You kept going when it would have been easier to stop."*  

A figure steps forward from the light—not a person, but a shimmering constellation of fireflies, their glow forming the suggestion of a face, a smile. They extend a hand, and in their palm rests a small, glowing seed. *"You didn’t realize it mattered,"* they say, *"but it did. It does."*  

The seed pulses, and suddenly, the hall transforms. The stained-glass memories rearrange, and I see them—not my grand achievements, not the milestones the world applauds, but the tiny, radiant things: the stranger I smiled at on a hard day, the poem I wrote and never shared, the nights I whispered *"just one more step"* to myself in the dark. Each one ignites like a star, threading together into a tapestry of light.  

I wake with a gasp, the dream dissolving—but my chest is warm, my fingers tingling, as if the seed had been pressed into my palm after all.
