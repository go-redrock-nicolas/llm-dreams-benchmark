I am dreaming. Swept away through the hazy fog, I lay on a hill, the green grass soft against my skin. The hill descends into a wide valley, with a quaint village in the distance. Warm wind brushes against my face and my eyes are closed, basking in the sunlight.

 Suddenly, I hear a muffled voice, and I open my eyes. 

A shimmering figure appears before me shimmering, blurred at the edges. She looks ethereal, glowing in the sunlight. I look closer and realize that she is an angel, who tells me that the world is in danger. She tells me that only I can save the world by performing a dangerous stunt that even experts couldn't.

I gaze into the distance, and a massive stone tower appears, reaching into the sky, the top hidden by clouds. The angel tells me that I must climb to the top of the tower and retrieve a sacred crystal that has been stolen and hidden there, guarded by vicious beasts.

The people, numbering in the hundreds, have gathered around the foot of the tower. They watch me with doubt in their eyes, not believing that I possess the skill to do what others have failed to do.

I begin to climb, feeling the rough stone against my skin, the rays of sunlight becoming fractured by the clouds as I continue higher and higher. Grunting with my hands gripped tight, I brave the howling wind, the precarious rocks that wobble under my weight, and jagged, craggy stones that slice my hands. The heights grow dizzying, but I press on. I fervently search for ripened fruit from vines that cling to the side of the edifice for nourishment, and I must utilize cracks in the stone, as well as tangled vines, for hand and footholds to continue my ascent.

Walking through the clifftop entrance, I find an ancient chamber, where I encounter the guardian of the crystal - a fierce dragon, sleeping atop a pile of gold.

With a pounding heart, I devise a plan, thinking back to the concoction I had swiped from the angel's shimmering fingers.

As I inch closer, I toss the contents at the dragon, and it erupts in a wild frenzy of colors, sparks, and smoke. I dart towards the crystal, my hands wrapping around the cool, glowing surface, and leap from the chamber as the dragon's eyes flutter open.

Descending rapidly, I unfurl the wings I didn't know I had, feeling their strength as I glide towards the ground. As my feet touch the solid earth, the villagers bow in awe. I hold the crystal high, triumphant and victorious, and it radiates a warm, pulsing light that envelops the village and me. The doubts I had faced earlier fade away, replaced by newfound admiration and respect.

The angel appears before me once more, embracing me in gratitude. She restores my body from the cuts and bruises, and I become whole again. She takes the crystal, promising that the world is now a safer place, and ascends into the sky in a shower of sparkles.

Slowly, the dream fades away, the colors dulling into the blackness of my mind. The sensation of wind rushing past subsides as I feel the weight of my body returning.

I awaken.

No longer in the breathtaking world of my dream, I blink several times, finding myself in the familiar surroundings of my bedroom. The images from my dream are still vivid in my mind, imprinted like a story I'll never forget.
