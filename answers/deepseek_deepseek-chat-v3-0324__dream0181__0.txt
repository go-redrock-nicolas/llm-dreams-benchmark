I am dreaming. The weight of an ornate scepter presses into my palm, a twisted helix of gold and pearl humming with an unfamiliar energy. I blink, and the throne room comes into focus—impossibly vast, its ceiling lost in swirling clouds of incense, its walls lined with tapestries that shift and murmur, showing histories I do not recognize. A voice, like wind through hollow reeds, had just proclaimed me sovereign.  

But the silence that follows is heavy, threaded with disbelief. Around the obsidian dais, ministers in deep indigo robes stare. Their eyes are not eyes but chasms, sucking in light, ancient beyond measure. One steps forward—his robe stitched with constellations that churn as he moves—and bows just low enough to avoid offense.  

"You are untested," he says, not unkindly, though his voice sends ice spiders skittering down my spine. "What do you know of the Falling Monarch’s curse? Or the treaty with the cities beneath the earth?"  

A murmur ripples through the court. A scribe in the corner is writing with a quill dipped in liquid shadow, and the words scorch themselves into the air before fading. I clutch the scepter tighter, and its pulse quickens, whispering things—half-formed warnings, secrets, a name that might be mine if I choose to claim it.  

Then, from the back, laughter—bright and sharp as shattered glass. A woman in armor made of mirrored shards strides forward, her helm an ever-shifting mask reflecting a thousand faces, none of them hers.  

"Let the age of the unprepared begin!" she declares, raising her sword. Its edge weeps tiny silver tears. "Let us see what chaos breeds!"  

And the ground beneath us trembles—not in fear, but anticipation.  

(Would you like to reign—or unravel?)
