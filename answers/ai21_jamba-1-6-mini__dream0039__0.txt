I am dreaming. In your vivid dream, you find yourself standing on a distant planet of swirling azure skies, where the air feels dense and cool, almost like the weight of the world is on your shoulders. The ground beneath you is a patchwork of deep violet soil and jagged, neon orange rocks that glow softly as if alive. The sky pulses with strange huesâ€”shifting between amaranth, cerulean, and golden streaks that cut through the clouds like ancient hieroglyphs written in light.

Time feels fluid, and the planet hums with an otherworldly energy. You sense its deep mysteries, vast as the cosmos stretching above. You hear whispers of the wind, a melody unlike anything you've heard before, carrying strange yet familiar words that don't belong to Earth.
