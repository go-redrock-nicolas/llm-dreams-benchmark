I am dreaming. The dream starts wordlessly, like water turning into music.

You awaken on the floor of an abandoned planetarium. Every velvet seat is empty, but the antique star-projector still whirs in the center, casting galaxies that rotate too fast, smearing constellations into streaks of molten silver. Something in you decides—even before you’ve bothered to stand—that the ordinary limits of ownership, politeness, or consequence no longer apply.

So you pull the cosmos down.

With a single tug you rip the projected heavens out of the air as if they were curtains. Constellations crumple in your fists like tissue paper, and when you shake them out they fall as real diamonds across the dusty floor. A notion sparks: Why not keep the brightest fragments? You pocket the Pleiades, slip Orion’s belt around your wrist like a bracelet, and kick aside the remaining stars to clang off the brass railings. The universe shrinks and trembles at your feet like a scolded pet.

A door appears—black-framed, gilt-hinged, utterly out of place. It bears a sign: “PRIVATE. NO ENTRY.” Without hesitation you fling it open. On the other side is an ocean suspended vertically, a wall of turquoise water that roars yet never spills. You step through the threshold and gravity forgets its job. Now you’re walking up rippling staircases sculpted from pure current: schools of fish dart beneath your heels, turning like living sequins. Each time one tries to dart away, you whistle; they freeze, glittering, and rearrange themselves into swirling patterns that spell your name. Somewhere below, ancient rules about respecting life tug feebly at your conscience, but you swat them aside like errant bubbles.

Higher and higher. You reach a plateau—an air bubble the size of a ballroom trapped inside the water. Inside this chamber stands a banquet table dressed in linen so white it glows like an eclipse’s corona. Silver platters wait, empty. You clap once; the platters fill with whatever flickers across your mind: towers of sugared lightning crackle beside roasted constellations that taste of cinnamon and nebula dust. A single seat remains person-shaped but unoccupied; you decide the chair is too presumptuous and kick it in half. You dine standing, ripping bites straight from the incandescent dishes. Each swallow warps the water outside the air shell, as if even the sea itself grimaces in offended etiquette.

When the last mouthful slides down, you shout for music. The chamber obeys. Violins made of shards of sunrise appear mid-air, playing themselves. The water outside vibrates with the refrain, splintering into kaleidoscopic corridors. Your pulse hammers to the rhythm. You sense countless unseen eyes—fish, forgotten gods, the timid conscience you buried earlier—watching, fearful, scandalized. You laugh in their direction, and your laugh becomes a soundwave-surfboard. You ride it straight through the liquid ceiling.

Suddenly you emerge beneath a moon that fills three-quarters of the sky, cratered and close enough to kiss. A city of alabaster rooftops clings to its surface like barnacles. “No Trespassing,” the rooftops whisper in choir-voices of cracked porcelain. You answer by leaping across the vacuum, landing in the city’s central plaza. Cobblestones shatter. Towers leaning in admonition topple around you like dominoes; bells toll in objection until you steal their clappers for jewelry.

Finally, a cathedral door swings open, enormous as a memory of guilt. Inside stands a mirrored hall, each panel showing alternate versions of you: some kinder, some smaller, some trembling at the edges. They glare in silent protest. You grin, raise a hand, and the mirrors dissolve into mercury that drips away, leaving only a boundless night sky—all rules erased, all boundaries flattened. Endless possibility yawns before you like an open script begging to be scribbled over.

And that is the moment you wake, the taste of stolen galaxies still fizzing on your tongue, the echo of collapsed starlight still humming around your heartbeat—vivid proof that even in sleep, nothing could bar your way once desire ignited.
