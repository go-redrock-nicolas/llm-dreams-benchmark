I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a grand library that seems to stretch into infinity, its walls lined with books of every size and color. The air is heavy with the musty scent of old parchment, and the only sound is the whisper of your own heartbeat. A sense of immense responsibility weighs on your shoulders, but you are not alone. Figures dressed in shimmering robes emerge from the shadows, bowing respectfully before you.

They call you "The Wearer of Time," a title that resonates with an ancient power you can't quite grasp. As you reach out to the nearest book, it opens and emits a soft golden light, illuminating a swirling vortex in the center of the room. The figures urge you towards it, their voices a harmonious chant that fills your veins with both fear and exhilaration.

 Emerging into a vast, storm-tossed ocean, you find yourself piloting an ancient ship of unyielding oak and glimmering gold. The wind howls, the waves crash, and the ship groans under the strain, but it obeys your subtle commands, moving effortlessly through the tempest.
