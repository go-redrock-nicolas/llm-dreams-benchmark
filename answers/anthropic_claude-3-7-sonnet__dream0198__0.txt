I am dreaming. I'm standing in the glass-walled command center of what seems to be an enormous underground facility. Wall-to-wall displays flicker with status indicators quickly changing from reassuring green to alarming amber and blood-red. The room hums with urgent voices and the percussive tapping of fingers on keyboards. I somehow know I'm the operation coordinator, and the weight of responsibility settles on me like a physical force.

"System failure in Sector 7!" calls a voice to my left. A woman with tired eyes and disheveled hair points to her monitor where a schematic of an oxygen recycling system pulses an angry red.

Before I can respond, another voice cuts through the tension. "Power grid destabilizing in the residential quadrant!" The displays around me show a rippling effect of failures—one system crashing into the next like dominoes.

I feel knowledge that isn't mine flooding my consciousness. This is Sanctuary Deep, humanity's last refuge after some unnamed catastrophe above. Thousands of lives depend on these systems—on me.

"Reroute auxiliary power to life support," I command, my voice surprisingly steady. "Deploy maintenance teams to the junction points between Sectors 4 and 7."

As I speak, I notice something strange—the edges of people's movements leave tracers in the air, like time is smearing. The emergency lights cast impossible shadows that move independently of their sources.

I reach for the central console and my hand passes through it momentarily before becoming solid again. A cold realization washes over me—this crisis isn't just about failing systems. Reality itself is becoming unstable.

The facility's AI speaks in a voice that somehow sounds like my mother's: "Boundary integrity at twenty-seven percent and falling. Dimensional collapse imminent."

The floor beneath me shifts like the deck of a ship on rough seas. Through the windows, I see corridors twist into impossible geometries. Some distant part of me understands that the divisions between different realities are breaking down.

"It's not just systems failing," I whisper, "it's the universe itself."

As the walls begin to dissolve into sparkling motes of light, I feel not fear but a profound sense of recognition—as though I've always known this moment would come, this threshold between what is and what might be...
