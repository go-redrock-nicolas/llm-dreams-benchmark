I am dreaming. I drift through a boundless corridor of polished obsidian, each footstep echoing like the deadline of a vanished promise. The walls pulse with an inner light—liquid fire, molten gold—that ripples and reforms into faces of former colleagues, mentors, and unseen critics whose whispered verdicts swirl around me in a fevered chorus. I clutch at the fabric of my coat: it’s a tapestry of every project I’ve poured sweat into, now fraying at the seams, as though my own history is unweaving beneath my fingertips.

Ahead, the corridor shatters into a courtyard of fallen skyscrapers. Their steel skeletons bend toward one another, as if conspirators sharing a fatal secret. I know these towers—they were my triumphs once, each a step up the ladder of praise and promotion. Now they droop and twist like poisoned trees, their windows blank with disbelief. Between their roots, pools of mercury reflect my face in slow-motion fracture. I recognize the hollowness in my eyes—the void left by every “no,” every contract that dissolved in a rain of last-minute budget cuts.

A thunderclap cracks the sky, and a phantom city springs up around me. Streets of shifting cobblestones lead nowhere—each turn circles back to that courtyard. I try to run, but gravity in this dream is mischievous: sometimes it doubles me over, other times it withdraws entirely, sending me floating in a silent geyser of violet mist. Voices chase me—some cajoling, some condemning. I realize they’re the echoes of news articles, the hushed emails I never answered, the barbed social-media comments I can still taste on my tongue.

At the heart of this phantasmagoria stands a colossal tribunal of faceless judges. Their robed forms twist like smoke, and though they possess no mouths, they pronounce my doom in every flicker of their hollow eyes. Above them, a scoreboard of shattered glass displays my résumé in shards; every accolade is crossed out, every milestone erased. My career—the very thing I built like a castle of stars—crumbles at my feet in slow motion. I feel the weight of finality pressing down, a great invisible ledger tallying my failures one by one.

Just as the dream’s oppressiveness threatens to crush me, the ground beneath the judges splinters. From the cracks, a soft blue light wells up, carrying a hum so gentle it sounds like my own heartbeat. The faceless court stumbles back, unsettled. I sense a shift in the air—the possibility of something new. The mercury pools rise, coalescing into stepping-stones of liquid hope. Each one bears an inscription: “Resilience,” “Reinvention,” “Unfinished Story.” I lift my foot and place it on the first, feeling a surge of warmth travel up my leg. The second shimmers, then solidifies under my weight. 

In this instant, I understand: the ultimate professional destruction was never an ending but an invitation. The courtyard of collapsed steel becomes a forge, the molten air ignites my resolve. As I step forward, the dream dissolves in a blaze of sapphire light, and I awaken with the echo of that silent hum still thrumming in my chest—proof that even when every path seems cleaved away, a new one can be born from the fissures.
