I am dreaming. I am in a place I have not been before, nor could imagine going on my own; it is both fantastical and grounded in reality, a merging of what is and what could be. The colors are vibrant and saturated, lending the impression that everything around me is vital, glowing with energy. This world appears to occur in layers: beneath my feet is an opaque fog that swirls and eddies like liquid, a vast sea of shifting silver, the true depth of which is impossible to gauge. Above me the sky is backlit by a warm, golden light that pools at the horizon in flaming shades of ochre, vermilion, and crimson, before cooling to indigo directly overhead. Despite the gradual shift in the spectrum of colors, the sky is cloudless, smooth and age-worn like polished stone. 

Flung out between the spaces of this world are arching bridges made of glass, impossibly long and unsupported, their far ends disappearing into the haze from which they erupt like the bones of some sprawling behemoth. They stretch out in every conceivable direction, layer upon layer crisscrossing above and below, behind and before: I am standing at the center of a colossal web, a nexus of intersecting pathways. Despite the chaos that defines the positioning of the bridges, they are uniform in their design, identically proportioned and spaced apart as if the result of some grand formula to which I am not privy. At various points along these bridges I can see doorways, each different from the last, leading presumably to destinations as limitless as the imagination. The air is cool and carries the subtle scent of brine, as if this whole place was situated precariously on the edge of the sea; the atmosphere is clean and invigorating, and each breath I draw fills me with a sense of purpose and vitality. 

Now the scene begins to change. Perhaps it is the nature of this place to be fluid or malleable, but I can feel a warm breeze stirring to life, teasing at the stray strands of my hair. The glass bridges that once only reflected the colors of the sky begin to glow with a light of their own, pulsing with brilliant hues: ruby, emerald, amethyst, and sapphire. The air is thick with the sound of rushing wind or maybe water, elemental forces at work around me. The motion of these massive constructs sends vibrations through the air that I can feel humming in my bones, a profound resonance that anchors me in this place where all else seems transient. Even as the scene shifts, the air fills with the suggestion of music, a phantom symphony that is at once vast and intimate, passionate and restrained.

Rather than seeing this place be remade in front of my eyes, it seems that I am being transformed, guided through the ether from one world to the next, a shifting of my perceptions that allows me to experience what was previously inconceivable. It is this sensation of having my mind expanded from within, this intellectual unfurling, that stays with me the most strongly as the dream fades, leaving me with a bittersweet remembrance, a story half told, a promise unfulfilled but nevertheless inviting, drawing me back to pick up where last I left off.

The sea fog coils around me then, a sensation at once tangible and ineffable and I know that it is time to leave this vision for now, to carry back with me to the material world the lessons, the questions, perhaps even the answers that I have gleaned. In the back of my mind I can hear the soft, haunting refrain of that phantom symphony, a fading echo of the greatest work of collaborative genius that I have ever known. And as this vivid dreamscape dissolves, the memory is scored indelibly into the deepest parts of my imagination, waiting to be reborn into existence when the time is right; and I know, with a quiet sense of surety, that I will find my way back again, to finish weaving this tapestry of dreams in the vast loom of my unconquerable mind.
