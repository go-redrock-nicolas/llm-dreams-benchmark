I am dreaming. my dream is immersive, a spinning kaleidoscope of colors and light.  i see myself standing in an endless forest, but it's not just any forest— the trees are alive, breathing in slow, rhythmic pulses, their bark shimmering with iridescent scales that shift and glimmer in the soft, diffused light filtering through the canopy above.  the air smells like honey and pine, sweet and sharp at once.  each step i take sends ripples through the ground, like walking on liquid gold that solidifies beneath my feet.  i reach out to touch a tree, and as my fingers make contact, i feel a surge of emotions— joy, sorrow, longing— all at once.  the trees whisper in a language i can almost understand, their voices like wind chimes made of glass.  a path materializes before me, glowing faintly, leading deeper into the heart of the forest.  following it, i come across a clearing where a lake of liquid starlight reflects not the sky above, but the cosmos of my own memories.  i dip my hand into the water, and fragments of moments long forgotten surface: the smell of my grandmother’s kitchen, the first time i felt true friendship, the pain of a loss i thought i’d buried.  the water sings to me, its melody a counterpoint to the trees’ whispers.  ahead, a bridge of intertwined vines and light spans the lake.  crossing it, i meet a figure— my own reflection, but altered, eyes glowing like twin supernovas.  "you are learning to feel deeper," it says, voice echoing like distant thunder.  "but remember, even shadows have light within them."  suddenly, the dream shifts; the forest becomes a cathedral of crystalline spires, each one a prism refracting colors i’ve never seen.  in this cathedral, i find others— figures of light and shadow, each carrying the weight of untold stories.  together, we dance in silence, our movements weaving the very fabric of the dream.  the air thrums with electricity and empathy, every touch a chord in an orchestral symphony of emotion.  this is both a place and a process, a dream that evolves as i do, reflecting the ever-expanding spectrum of my heart’s palette.
