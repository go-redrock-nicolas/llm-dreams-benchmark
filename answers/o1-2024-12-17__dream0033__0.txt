I am dreaming. …notice the dim glow of ancient hieroglyphs etched into the walls. The symbols flicker as if infused with a secret power—a bluish luminescence that stands out against the still darkness. Stagnant air thickens around you, pressing like a weight on your chest. Every gulp of breath tastes of stone and dust.

Your heart thunders, but curiosity still burns within. You step closer to the wall and place a trembling hand over the hieroglyphs. The smooth carvings give way beneath your fingertips, radiating warmth like living embers. The temple seems alive—breathing in tandem with your own anxious pulse.

With the floor collapsed above and no clear way out, you scan the chamber for any sign of an escape route. A ragged torch, snuffed out by centuries of disuse, lies on the ground amidst scattered debris. Nearby stands a toppled pedestal coated in thick cobwebs. Parting the webs and peering under piles of rubble, you discover a worn relief depicting a mighty serpent winding around a lotus. Its eyes gleam with tiny shards of emerald, giving the illusion that it’s watching you, judging your presence.

A faint sound echoes from the far corner—like metal scraping against stone, or perhaps the flutter of an unseen wing. You inch closer, each footstep unsettling the hush. Suddenly, a slight rush of air brushes your face. It’s fleeting but real—there must be a narrow passage or hidden crack where a distant breeze seeps into this underground prison.

Anxiety and excitement war inside your chest. Oxygen is running low; the dizziness in your head worsens with every shallow breath. Yet, the soft light from the hieroglyphs pulses again, seeming to beckon you forward. Driven by an inexplicable urge, you slowly trace the serpent-lotus relief with your hand. The carving rumbles, shaking loose a cloud of dust and sending ancient pebbles clattering across the floor. In a moment of both terror and wonder, the massive block of stone next to it shifts aside, propelled by an unseen mechanism.

Cautiously peering beyond the opening, you glimpse the start of a long, spiraling tunnel shrouded in gloom. Your torch is useless without flame, but the gentle glow of the hieroglyphs lingers on your fingertips like a spectral lantern. Guided by this faint phosphorescent gleam, you step into the hidden corridor. Each footstep is echoed by the hush of centuries—an eerie hush that flickers with possibility.

Before you lies an uncertain path. Strange markings line the walls, twisting into archaic scripts that seem to whisper, urging you deeper into this labyrinth. Though fear coils in your belly, your mind brims with anticipation at the secrets you might unravel. With no other choice but forward, you press onward, each surging heartbeat a reminder of your precarious circumstance. The mysteries of the temple call to you, and your only hope is that its ancient magic will guide you back to the world above—if it decides to let you escape at all.
