I am dreaming. The sensation of weightlessness envelops me like a comforting shroud as I float effortlessly through the crystal-clear waters of the underwater cave. The beam of my scuba gear's light dances across the glittering stalactites and stalagmites, casting an ethereal glow on the ancient limestone formations. I feel a sense of freedom and tranquility, the water pressure a gentle caress against my skin. Schools of rainbow-hued fish dart past me, their scales shimmering like jewels as they weave through the darkness.

As I swim deeper into the cave, the air supply gauge on my tank begins to tick away, its monotone voice a steady reminder of my limited time. I squeeze through a narrow opening, and the water rushes past me like a silk scarf, rippling my skin with each gentle caress. The tunnel opens into a vast underwater cavern, its ceiling lost in the depths above. Towering stone pillars rise from the seafloor, supporting an intricate network of dripping waterways and fragile, glowing jellyfish-like auroras.

But amidst the serene beauty, a faint feeling of trepidation begins to creep in, like a twilight shadow creeping over the moon. I glance over my shoulder, and my heart skips a beat as I see the passage behind me begin to cave in. The walls are crumbling, the rubble swiftly filling the narrow tunnel, and I know I'm running out of air. Panic's icy fingers claw their way up my spine as reality asserts its stronghold over my peaceful reverie.

Alarm echoes through the water, a distress signal broadcast to the emptiness around me. Attempts at calm logic are overridden by primal instincts. I frantically scan my surroundings, mentre alert for any escape route. The remaining air from my tank hisses with a low shriek, a steady countdown to the inevitable. My heart pounds in my chest like a jackhammer, threatening to shatter the fragile tranquility of the underwater world.

The cave's eerie silence is shattered by the sound of rushing water, the roar growing louder as the passage collapses further. I'm trapped, with no clear escape route in sight. My thoughts are a jumbled mess of fear and desperation, as I realize I'm running out of time. The darkness closing in around me is a living, breathing entity, its crushing weight suffocating me. My air supply dwindles, and I'm left with a haunting sense of hopelessness, the only sound the steady hiss of my tank and the ominous rumble of the cave's collapse.

In this desperate, dreamlike state, I'm forced to confront the abyss, the unknown, and the limits of my own mortality. The water's icy grip tightens around me, a cold, unforgiving shroud that threatens to extinguish the flickering flame of my consciousness. I'm trapped in a desperate, underwater nightmare, with no escape from the crushing weight of the cave's collapse, and the suffocating darkness that's closing in around me...
