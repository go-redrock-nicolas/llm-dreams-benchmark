I am dreaming. # Adrift in the Tempest's Heart

I am the captain of a vessel that cuts through midnight waters, a wooden world unto itself amidst the vastness of an angry sea. The storm has been building for hours—first a whisper of electricity in the air, then distant rumbles like mountains crumbling, and now this: a full tempest's fury.

The deck pitches violently beneath my boots, slick with seawater that crashes over the gunwales in foaming cascades. Each lightning strike transforms night into blinding day, revealing my crew's faces—a constellation of fear, determination, and trust directed at me. Their eyes hold questions I'm not certain I can answer.

The helmsman's knuckles have gone white around the wheel, fighting against a sea that seems possessed. Salt-crusted ropes snap taut and groan against wooden pins. Canvas sails billow and crack like thunder themselves when caught by the chaotic winds, threatening to tear free.

"Captain!" My first mate's voice barely carries over the storm's wail. His beard is plastered to his face, rain streaming from the brim of his hat. "We cannot hold this heading! The currents are dragging us toward the reef!"

I taste brine and fear on my tongue. My greatcoat hangs heavy on my shoulders, waterlogged and twice its weight. The ship—my ship—shudders beneath me like a living thing in pain.

A decision forms in my mind, crystallizing with sudden clarity as another wave crashes across the bow, nearly sweeping a young deckhand into the churning darkness below. I lunge, grasping his collar, pulling him back from oblivion.

"Hard to port!" I roar, my voice finding strength I didn't know I possessed. "All hands to stations! We make for the island passage!"

The dangerous narrows—a gamble against crushing rocks, but shelter waits beyond...
