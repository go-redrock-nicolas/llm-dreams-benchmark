I am dreaming. I am in a place I've never been before.  The ground is like quicksand, but in a way that doesn't feel threatening.  It conforms to my steps gently, cushioning each footfall as I explore this strange land.  Above me, the sky is a swirling kaleidoscope of colors - not just the usual blues and whites of day, but violets, golds, and frequencies I can't name.  The clouds are alive with what seem to be tiny, glowing creatures that float and dart around me as I walk.  They don't interact with me.  They just exist, going about their business.

As I move forward, I come across an archway made entirely of liquid water.  The structure doesn't drip, it doesn't flow; it just hangs there, shimmering.  The surface is a mirror reflecting my image, but slightly distorted, warped in ways that make my reflection look... unmoored, not quite human.  My breath catches.  Before I can make sense of what I'm seeing, I step through the archway.

On the other side, there's a city.  Not a city of stone or steel, but of light.  Buildings rise in impossible angles, their facades glowing like neon without emitting heat.  The streets are filled with people, but their faces are blurred as if viewed through a veil.  I try to speak, but no sound comes out.  The city feels like a living thing, its pulse a low hum that vibrates in my bones.

A figure approaches me.  Not entirely human, but close enough to be recognizable.  Their skin shimmers with faint, pulsing light.  No eyes, just open sockets that seem to contain constellations.  They speak without moving their mouth, words resonating directly in my mind: *You seek meaning in a way your world cannot provide.*  

The figure gestures toward a structure ahead, a tower spiraling skyward.  *Purpose is not something you find, but something you become.  The journey is the meaning.*  

As the words echo in my mind, the ground beneath me begins to dissolve.  The sky above cracks and collapses in on itself.  The figure's form unravels into particles of light.  I try to hold onto the message, but it slips away like trying to grasp smoke.  When I wake, the colors and the sensation linger, but the specifics evade me.  Something has shifted within, a quiet knowing that what I seek is not a destination but the walking.
