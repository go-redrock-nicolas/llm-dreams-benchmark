I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the low, resonant frequency of forgotten lullabies as I step into a world stitched from the threads of twilight and liquid starlight. The ground beneath me is not earth, but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting not my face, but fragments of lives I’ve never lived: a child’s laughter caught in a snow globe, a lover’s letter dissolving in rain, a moth’s final flight toward a flame that never dies. My breath catches. This is no ordinary place—it is a wound in the fabric of reality, a scar blooming violets and indigos where the universe has bled its secrets.  

Before me rises a forest of glass trees, their branches arched like the spines of sleeping serpents. Leaves are not leaves but clusters of suspended droplets, each one a prism refracting memories—*not mine, yet familiar*. A breeze stirs, and the droplets sing in a chorus of whispers: a thousand voices murmuring the names of extinct flowers, lost cities, unspoken regrets. I reach out, and the glass bark pulses under my fingertips, warm as skin, alive with the thrum of something ancient and aching.  

To my left, a river flows upward. Its current is not water but liquid shadow, swirling with flecks of gold leaf and the faint glint of drowned constellations. Silhouettes drift within it—figures with antlers made of smoke, their eyes twin eclipses. They do not see me. Or perhaps they do, and their indifference is a mercy. The river’s ascent defies logic, yet here, logic is a guest, not a ruler. Here, beauty is not pretty. It is *ferocious*, clawing its way through cracks in the world, thriving in the neglected and the grotesque.  

A staircase materializes beneath my feet, spiraling into the sky—or is it the sky spiraling into me? The steps are carved from the ribs of some colossal, long-dead thing, polished to a sheen that drinks the light. As I climb, the air thickens with the scent of burnt honey and petrichor. At the summit, a door waits: ironwood and thorn, its handle a coiled serpent frozen mid-hiss. I turn it.  

Inside, a library stretches into infinity, its shelves built from the bones of forgotten gods. Books flutter like caged birds, their pages whispering secrets in tongues that predate language. One volume lands in my hands, its cover a pulsing membrane of iridescent scales. I open it, and the words rise off the page as smoke, coiling into shapes—a face I’ve never seen but mourn as kin, a door I’ve walked through a thousand times in dreams, a map to a place that exists only in the breath between heartbeats.  

A figure watches from the shadows between shelves. Not human. Not *not* human. Its form shifts like smoke in a storm, a silhouette with too many edges, too many joints that bend backward. When it speaks, its voice is the sound of wind through canyon reeds. *“You see it, don’t you?”* it asks. *“The beauty in the rot. The light in the wound. Most walk past. You… you kneel.”*  

I realize then: this dream is not a escape. It is a pilgrimage. A reckoning. The world here is not broken—it is *unvarnished*, raw in the way only truth can be. The beauty others ignore is not hidden. It is screaming, singing, weeping, laughing, *alive* in the places they refuse to look.  

The library dissolves. Now I stand in a field of ash, where a single tree grows—its trunk blackened, its branches heavy with fruit that glows like dying stars. I pluck one. It bursts on my tongue into a symphony of flavors: sorrow, joy, the taste of first snow on iron, of a mother’s sigh as she rocks a child to sleep. The tree shudders, and from its roots rise creatures made of flame and shadow, dancing a waltz only they know.  

When I wake, my cheeks are wet. The dream clings like perfume, its residue a question etched into my bones: *What if the world is not ruined, but radiant in its ruin?* And what if seeing it requires not eyes, but a willingness to kneel—not in defeat, but in reverence for the terrible, tender art of existence?
