I am dreaming. I find myself floating through a swirling vortex of iridescent clouds, suddenly landing with a soft thud on an exotic planet teeming with alien flora. An ethereal being materializes before me, its translucent form shifting between butterfly and human features.

"Greetings, human," the creature's voice echoes in my mind. "You have been chosen for a cosmic quest of unimaginable importance."

The being explains that a distant galaxy is threatened by a malevolent entity consuming entire star systems. However, this dark force can only be vanquished by a master chef specializing in intergalactic cuisine.

I pause in disbelief - I'm not even a skilled cook, let alone prepared to save a galaxy from an alien threat. But a group of highly advanced robots surrounds me, beginning an intensive culinary training program that pushes my senses to the limit.
