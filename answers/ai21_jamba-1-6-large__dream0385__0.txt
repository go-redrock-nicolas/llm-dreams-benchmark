I am dreaming. In my dream, it feels like I’m watching a close friend or someone I care deeply about standing on the edge of a cliff, staring down at turbulent waters far below. The winds are strong, and as they lean forward, I can feel myself wanting to call out, to warn them of the danger, to pull them back to safety. But my voice doesn’t carry. It’s as though the wind snatches my words away, leaving only silence between us. 

The air around them is thick with shadows, swirling and moving like an ominous fog. It clouds their vision and their heart. I can see the lights flickering in their eyes, dimmed by choices that seem to pull them away from what's good and true. Each step they take is slow, deliberate, like they’re searching for something but can’t quite figure out what it is. 

I try to get closer, to reach out and hold their hand, but every time I try, something invisible stops me. Then, I notice figures in the fog, voices whispering words I can’t quite make out. They seem to be telling my loved one to keep going, to walk toward the edge, promising peace or happiness beyond. The truth is, I know deep in my soul that those promises are lies, but the words feel so soothing, so convincing. 

As much as I want to scream out, telling them to stop, to turn back, my voice gets trapped in my chest. I can see the pain in their eyes, the confusion they feel, like they’re caught between two worlds—lightness and despair. And so, I stay close, silent and watchful, hoping I can reach them, praying they’ll hear a small whisper in their heart that guides them back.

But all the while, I’m gripped by this deep fear that maybe, just maybe, they’ll take that final step. And I won’t be able to save them.
