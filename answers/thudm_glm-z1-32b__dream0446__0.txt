I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, opulent ballroom suspended above an infinite void.  The ceiling is a swirling galaxy, casting prismatic light across floors of liquid mercury.  My reflection shifts like my decisions.  

A gilded pocket watch dangles from my fingertips, its chain a serpent withruby eyes.  The hands move rapidly, counting down moments I can't afford to waste, yet when I try to close my hand, the serpent unhinges its jaw and licks my palm with a velvet tongue.  The clock's face alternates between two futures: a mansion wreathed in ivy & thorn, and a dockside shack glowing with lanterns. Each image pulses with correspondingly cool/arctic temperatures.  

My choice is in the watch - wear it or abandon it.  Mercury underfoot turns viscous when uncertainty rises.  Do I twist the serpent's head to trap the chosen fate inside?  A distant chord of piano scales resolves into a scattered cacophony as the void pulses darker.  Silver dust from the ceiling rains down, each particle reflecting simultaneous sunsets and moons.  The serpent's hiss crescendos into a human voice: "Some diamonds form through pressure, some stars through explosion â€” which pain are you intending?"
