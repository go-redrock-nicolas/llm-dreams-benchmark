I am dreaming. The knowledge sits like molten lead in my chest, burning and churning as I watch them move through their daily routines with blissful ignorance. Their smile still brightens the room, yet now it pierces me like shards of glass, knowing what I know. Every casual conversation becomes an intricate dance around the truth, each word carefully chosen to avoid stumbling into that forbidden territory.

The dreamscape warps and shifts around us - familiar rooms stretch and distort like melting wax, the walls seeming to pulse with the weight of my secret. Colors take on strange new meanings: their favorite blue sweater now reminds me of drowning, the yellow curtains they love feel like a sickly warning sign.

In this dream-state, I see double: the person they believe themselves to be overlaid with the reality I've discovered, like two photographs imperfectly aligned. When they laugh, I hear both the genuine joy and the hollow echo of what that laughter would become if they knew. Their innocence has become both precious and painful to witness.

Time moves strangely - sometimes rushing forward in anxious bursts, other times stretching like taffy as I watch them plan for a future that my knowledge could shatter. The secret feels physically present, like a shadow creature perched on my shoulder, whispering temptations to unburden myself, to share this crushing weight.

In this dream, even silence becomes dangerous - each quiet moment threatens to crack open and spill forth the truth. I find myself speaking too much, too fast, filling the air with meaningless chatter just to drown out the words struggling to escape. My hands shake when I hold their photographs, and I've started avoiding mirrors, afraid to see the lie written across my face.

The dream pulses with the question: Is protecting them from this truth an act of love or betrayal? The answer shifts like quicksand beneath my feet, never letting me find solid ground. Their trust in me feels simultaneously like a precious gift and a crushing burden, and I'm trapped in this liminal space between truth and mercy, watching them smile, laugh, and live in a world that's now filled with invisible fault lines only I can see.
