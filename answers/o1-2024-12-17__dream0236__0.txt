I am dreaming. …you find yourself standing in a grand, circular amphitheater carved into the side of a crystalline mountain. The sky above is swirling with violet and saffron clouds, and each swirl seems to hum with faint, melodic overtones that reverberate through the air like ghostly violins.

The stone steps under your feet feel cool and slightly damp, as if chiseled from living rock that still breathes. Before you stands an imposing marble stage. Its surface gleams with veins of shimmering gold that catch the phosphorescent glow emanating from the surrounding crystal walls. Gathered around this stage, in semicircular rows of ornate seats, are robed figures from every corner of the realm—sages, mystics, and fellow apprentices who whisper behind intricately embroidered scarves. Their eyes pierce you with both curiosity and expectation.

A sign, etched in swirling runes that shift and flicker like living flame, announces your name beside the grand title of this esoteric craft. Everyone here believes you’ve spent years perfecting arcane techniques, although precisely yesterday, you were only just introduced to them. Your heart thuds in your chest like a thunderous drumbeat. For a moment, you doubt you can conjure the ability to move your limbs in the right sequence, let alone weave the invisible threads of magic required.

A tall figure with skin the color of midnight and eyes like polished moonstone strides to the center of the stage, raising both hands. Suddenly, the entire amphitheater’s hidden mechanisms kick into motion. Polished mirrors unfold from the stage’s rim, and jewel-encrusted braziers ignite in perfect synchronicity, bathing the space in cascading prisms of light. A hush falls over the crowd. The figure extends a single, tapered finger at you, silently inviting you to join him center stage.

As you step forward, the texture of the floor changes beneath your feet. The gold veins pulse in time with your heartbeat, sending shimmering energy into the soles of your shoes. You can feel it pooling in your core, stirring your latent potential. You try to remember the complicated sequences your mysterious mentor taught you: the sharp swirl of the wrist, the low pivot on the heel, the whispered incantation that must be woven just so. Your nerves threaten to scatter your focus, but somehow, you manage to keep your breath steady.

With your first movement, the fibers of reality seem to bend. A wispy ribbon of silvery light manifests from your outstretched palm, spiraling upward like an ethereal serpent. The watchers gasp, and you sense their wonder fueling your newfound powers. Each step you take etches runic patterns into the stage. Your voice, surprisingly clear, recites the ancient language—half-remembered phrases that swirl through your mind like drifting confetti. 

Then, just as you begin to trust in the currents of magic coiling through you, the runes flare brightly, threatening to overwhelm your concentration. Waves of color shimmer around the amphitheater, warping the mirrored panels behind you, each reflection showing a slightly different version of yourself. Some reflections have swirling tattoos on their arms; others sport luminescent eyes or horns curling behind their temples. The images unnerve you, but you hold your gaze firm, reminding yourself—and them—that you are not your fear.

You continue weaving the dazzling ribbons of power, shaping them into grand arcs that intertwine above your head. The spectacle draws gasps and murmurs of awe from the crowd, but you feel the strain in your muscles and mind. Beads of sweat streak down your brow. A single mispronounced syllable or a fraction-of-a-second lapse in concentration could unravel everything in an explosive cascade of magic.

Yet, you persist. There’s an unexpected wellspring of determination within you, a warmth that blossoms in your chest and urges you forward. You recall glimpses of your fleeting lessons: a high, spiraling motion with your left hand, a gentle chord plucked from within your own heart, a whispered note that channels cosmic rhythms. Each piece falls into place.

Suddenly, with a final flourish of your arms, the swirling lights coalesce into a glowing orb above the stage—a shimmering testament to your newly awakened powers. The robed audience rises to its feet, and a chorus of applause resonates across the amphitheater, echoing off luminous crystal walls like distant thunder.

Breathless, you lower your arms, heart vibrating in your chest from astonishment and relief. You have channeled this mysterious craft for the first time in a grand performance you had no right to be able to pull off—and yet, you just did. The tall figure smiles, a silent acknowledgment of your accomplishment. The acceptance, the hush of the crowd, and the shimmering residue of your conjuration converge around you like a gentle embrace.

The dream begins to blur at its edges, the amphitheater’s carved walls and swirling clouds fusing into soft shapes of prismatic color. But you can still feel that transformative warmth throbbing in your heart, lingering as a promise—an affirmation that, sometimes, even the most unprepared souls can find unexpected genius within themselves when the universe calls them forth.
