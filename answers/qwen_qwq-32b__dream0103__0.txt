I am dreaming. I encounter an ancient riddle carved into stone. It has been unsolved for millennia. I look closely at the symbols and cryptic clues. Then......the air shimmers, heavy with the weight of forgotten epochs. The stones around you pulse faintly, as if breathing in time with your heartbeat. The riddle’s symbols—swirling spirals, jagged lightning bolts, and eyes without faces—begin to *quicken*, their edges bleeding into one another like watercolors in a storm. 

A voice, neither young nor old, whispers in your mind: *"Beneath the root of the sky-tree, where three moons kiss the horizon, answer this: What climbs but never walks, digs but never tires, drinks the earth’s blood yet spills no tears? To name it is to unlock the vault; to falter is to become stone."*

Your palms sweat. The answer hovers just beyond thought. You feel it in the ache of your bones, a primordial truth. The ground trembles. Somewhere, something *stirs* deep below. 

You guess: *"A mountain?"* 

The stones scream. 

Light erupts.

Wait—it wasn’t mountains that grew, but *roots*. Thick, obsidian vines burst from the earth, tearing through rock, their thorns humming ancient power. The voice hisses: *"ALMOST. CLOSER—"*

Your throat tightens. The vines coil around you, icy and alive. 

*"What crawls without legs, seeks without eyes, devours stone yet wears time like a cloak?"* 

The answer flashes—you gasp: *"Moss!"* 

Too late. One tendril pierces your shoulder. The world tilts. But then—*laugher*, echoing like a glacier calving. The voice softens. 

*"…Clever. Very clever. Fallback then: the answer is WORM."* 

A stone archway materializes, glowing with trapped starlight. Behind it yawns a chasm, its depths thrumming with a heartbeat. 

You step forward, and the ground falls away— 

--- 
The dream shifts. You’re now *inside* the earth, floating in a sea of liquid amber. Glowing creatures dart past, their forms shifting between fish, birds, and flames. They sing a melody that tastes of iron and honey. Ahead looms the vault—a spire of living crystal, its core swirling with galaxies. 

To touch it, you must solve one last puzzle carved into the spire’s base: 

*“I am born from a lie, nourished by truth, yet I vanish when seen. What am I?”* 

Your mind races—you whisper, *"A shadow?"* 

The crystal flares. Not yet. 

*“What dies to live, yet lives to die? Born in fire, drowned in light.”* 

A gasp escapes you. *"A sun?"* 

The spire shudders, releases a prismatic scream. Then—stillness. 

*“Child of the Dreaming Ones,”* the voice intones. *"You tread close. The final answer: HOPE."* 

You reach... 

...and the vault *sings*. 

Lightning. Thunder. A thousand voices. 

Then—awakening, gasping, with the taste of stardust on your tongue.
