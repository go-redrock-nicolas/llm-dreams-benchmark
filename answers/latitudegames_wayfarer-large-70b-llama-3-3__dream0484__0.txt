I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, starlit ocean, the waves gently lapping at the shore beneath bare feet. As I breathe in the salty air, a sensation of unshakable certainty overwhelms me - I am absolutely convinced that I'm completely unable to swim. The belief has been etched into my very being since childhood, reinforced by past experiences and ingrained fears.

But something shifts within me. The tide of the present moment sweeps away my stagnant thoughts, and I catch sight of a glinting mirror nestled in the sand. As I walk towards it, the glass takes shape as a portal to my inner self. Within its depths, I see a younger version of myself splashing joyfully in a backyard pool. The scene expands, revealing walls lined with swimming trophies and smiling faces of supportive parents. My mind reels as memories long buried surface - I was, in fact, a natural swimmer as a child. Anxiety and negative self-talk had distorted my perception over the years.

This revelation feels like chains breaking free from my limbs. All this time, my 'inability' to swim was a story I've been telling myself, a lie masking my true potential. I feel a rush of exhilaration as this weight lifts off my shoulders. My feet begin to move of their own accord, wading into the cool, dark water. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and push off the bottom.
