I am dreaming. You are adrift in a vast hall of shifting light. The walls ripple like liquid silver, and every step you take echoes as if inside a seashell. Above you, translucent ribbons of color drift through the air—emerald green, sunset orange, deep violet—each one humming with a soft, resonant tone. You find yourself inexplicably moved, though nothing in particular has happened to merit such feeling.  

Exploring this heightened sensitivity, you follow one ribbon as it dips and coils around your outstretched hand. Up close, you see tiny motes of starlight pulsing within its seams, as if each ribbon carries its own secret heartbeat. When you brush your fingers along its surface, a warm sigh of sound spills into the air, and suddenly your chest tightens: a single tear blossoms at the corner of your eye.  

You blink, startled—why cry here, in a place of silent wonder? But the moment itself feels unbearably poignant. The ribbon dissolves into mist, and in its place a white feather drifts down, tumbling end over end. You reach for it, and as you touch its softness, memories flood in—not of anything you consciously remember, but of distant sunlit mornings, the smell of dew on grass, laughter echoing in a backyard you can no longer locate. Your throat tightens, and more tears spill freely now.  

All at once the hall transforms: the silvery walls melt away into a meadow of tall, whispering grass. Each blade gleams with dew like a thousand tiny lanterns. The feather flutters down in slow motion, tracing an arc that seems to draw your attention to an old wooden bench beneath a massive, gnarled oak. On that bench sits a small, ragged doll—no larger than your hand—its button eyes reflecting your own tears with uncanny clarity.  

You set the feather beside the doll, and a soft melody rises from the grass, a lullaby half-forgotten. It presses against your heart so insistently that you crouch beside the bench, gently picking up the doll. The moment your fingers close around its fabric torso, the world brightens, as if a thousand dawns are dawning at once. You realize the tenderness you feel isn’t about the feather or the doll themselves, but about the echo of something once precious and now irrevocably changed.  

In that space between waking and sleeping, you cradle the doll to your chest and allow yourself to weep for the innocence you’ve lost and the beauty you still carry. The meadow’s lullaby swells, carrying you upward on a wave of gentle light—and as your tears glisten like tiny stars on your cheeks, you understand: this dream isn’t showing you a pain to avoid, but a memory that needs honoring.  

You breathe in the hush of the meadow, and for the first time in a long while, you lean into your own tenderness, letting it guide you between one world and the next.
