I am dreaming. I bite into a strawberry, and instead of seeds, tiny blinking lights spill out, each containing a memory of me laughing when no one else is around.
I am dreaming.

The air hums with the smell of burnt sugar and distant thunderstorms as I stand in a plaza paved with tessellated mirrors, each fragment reflecting a different version of myself: a flushed stranger in a sequined mask laughing too loudly, a shadow hunched over a notebook whispering secrets to moths, a statue of polished marble with eyes like frozen lakes. My footsteps fracture as I walk, splintering into echoes of stifled apologies and swallowed giggles. 

Then—a strawberry appears, cradled in my palm, luminescent as a dying star. I bite. The flesh gives way not to tartness but to cold, electric light. Tiny blinking seeds spill like fallen constellations onto the mirrored ground, each orb pulsing with scenes: me alone in a bathtub singing sea shanties to a rubber duck admiral, dancing barefoot in midnight kitchens to music only the refrigerator hum understands, sobbing violently at a sunset while clutching a wilting dandelion. The seeds roll away, slipping into mirror-cracks, and wherever they land, the reflections shatter—masked selves dissolving into confetti, marble cracking to reveal wet, trembling earth beneath.

The plaza begins to flood. Water rises, liquid and mercury-thick, carrying the floating lights. I wade deeper, seeds sticking to my skin like bioluminescent freckles. A voice, neither mine nor a stranger’s, thrums in the current: *"You taste like the quiet hour between midnight and confession."* When I open my mouth to reply, fireflies stream out, each one a silent, golden laugh. 

Above, the storm breaks. Raindrops fall as liquid glass, freezing every mirrored shard in midair. Suspended there—a thousand fractured selves, finally still. The only movement is the strawberry’s glow in my grip, beating like a heart, or a lighthouse.
