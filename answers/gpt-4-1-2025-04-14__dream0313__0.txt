I am dreaming. I find myself drifting in a delicate haze—one foot in the waking world, the other submerged in the strange, uncharted waters of my own subconscious. Here, the sky is a deep, swirling lavender, pulsing with shifting ribbons of gold and midnight blue, like the auroras of a distant planet. Buildings rear up on impossible stilts, balanced precariously, with their rooftops sprouting wildflowers and ancient cypress trees. Every window reflects a different childhood memory, looping silently.

In the center of it all, a grand theater sits on the banks of a glassy, ink-black river. The doors are open wide, beckoning. Inside, the velvet seats are filled with plush toys and childhood friends, each face flickering momentarily between joy and the trace of old, small discontents. On the stage, I stand alone, the unreliable narrator in my own fantastical drama.

A sudden hush falls as I begin to speak about something that aches deep in my chest—a sadness, a sorrow, an unresolved ache. Without warning, sharp humor bubbles up, spilling from my lips like a rogue stream. I quip and jest, the words tumbling out as brittle jokes, each one an ill-fitting mask for the pain I cannot name. The audience laughs—a strange, echoing sound that rolls over itself, as though even my plush companions know this is a deflection, a shield forged from nervous wit.

In the swirling purple light, I see myself—split into two: one self deflecting, the other watching with the knowledge of what I am doing. The watcher steps forward, takes my hand, and gently, kindly, turns me back to face the truth. The laughter fades into the shimmer of the room, and the theater fills with the scent of rain-soaked earth, promise and rebirth.

Recognizing my humor as a shield rather than a sword, I allow the feelings to ripple through me—not as a punchline, but as poetry. The theater transforms, its walls dissolving into open fields of poppies and tall, swaying grass under a sky dappled with infinite stars. Here, at last, pain is met with acceptance, and my laughter blends with the wind—not forced, but genuine, tinged with relief and bittersweet understanding. 

The dream deepens, the world softens, and within this place woven from the deepest threads of my being, I learn that there is a time for laughter, and another for honest feeling—and sometimes, if I am gentle with myself, the two can coexist, each honoring the other like old, beloved friends.
