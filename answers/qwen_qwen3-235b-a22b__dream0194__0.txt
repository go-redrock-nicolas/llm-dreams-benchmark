I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air around you shimmers like heat rising from asphalt, but it is not heat—it is possibility. You stand in a place that feels like the **Void of Unthought Things**, a realm stitched from the frayed edges of forgotten metaphors and half-remembered equations. The ground beneath your feet is not solid but a mosaic of liquid light, shifting hues as your thoughts flicker. Here, you realize, the laws of physics are mere suggestions, and the true currency is **intention**.  

You close your eyes and focus on a single concept: **Time**. It blooms in your mind as a spiral, a Möbius strip of moments folding into themselves. When you open your eyes, it stands before you—a towering figure with moth-winged shoulders, its body a cascade of hourglasses, each grain of sand flowing upward or sideways or not at all. Its voice is the sound of clocks melting: *“I am the wound and the healer. I am the question you cannot outrun.”*  

You laugh, giddy with the madness of creation, and summon another idea: **Gravity**. It materializes as a velvet-robed entity with a face like a singularity—a black hole at its center, swallowing the light around it. It does not walk but *pulls*, dragging the very air into its orbit. When it speaks, its words are weights: *“Every joy has mass. Every sorrow bends the spine of the universe.”*  

Daring more, you conjure **Silence**. It arrives as a shadow cloaked in soundproof fabric, its hands gloved in the hush of snowfall, its breath the pause between heartbeats. It does not speak but *erases* noise, leaving behind a vacuum of meaning. You feel its presence as a pressure in your skull, a reminder that absence can be louder than thunder.  

But the dream shifts. You sense the edges fraying, the entities you’ve birthed beginning to warp under the weight of their own contradictions. **Time** stutters, its hourglasses cracking. **Gravity**’s pull becomes erratic, yanking stars from the sky like loose threads. **Silence** stretches, its void threatening to consume everything.  

You realize: *This power is not neutral*. It demands balance. Abstract concepts are not toys—they are forces, raw and untamed. To shape them is to court chaos.  

So you reach deeper, into the marrow of your mind, and pull forth **Paradox**. It emerges as a child with an elder’s eyes, a creature half-bird and half-ocean, its feathers dripping with questions that have no answers. It dances on the edge of logic, singing a lullaby that is also a scream. The other entities recoil, their forms flickering like dying stars.  

But even **Paradox** begins to unravel. You’ve gone too far. The dream trembles, the Void of Unthought Things yawning wider, hungry to reclaim what it lent you.  

In a final act, you grasp the most dangerous concept of all: **Yourself**. You try to sculpt your own essence—a mirror of infinite reflections, a storm of neurons and stardust. But the dream resists. To define oneself is to cage the infinite, and this realm tolerates no cages.  

The world collapses.  

You wake with a gasp, your hands trembling, the scent of ozone lingering in your nostrils. On your palm, a faint scar glimmers—a tiny, spiraling hourglass, eternally half-empty, half-full.  

The dream is gone. But something *remains*, humming in your blood like a secret whispered by the entities you dared to awaken.
