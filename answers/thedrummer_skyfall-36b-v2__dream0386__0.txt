I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a strange, yet oddly familiar city, the streets stretched out before me like an endless labyrinth of glass and steel. The air hums with an electric energy, pulsing through my veins as I walk with purpose, my gaze fixed ahead. 

I ignore the stares and murmurs of passersby, their eyes wide with a mix of curiosity and disapproval. Their judgement bounces off me like water off a duck's back. In this place, in my dream realm, I am unbound, free to indulge every whim and desire.

I spot a glimmering storefront up ahead, a boutique filled with the most exquisite, outrageous fashion pieces I've ever laid eyes on. The clothes are a riot of color and textures, each one more daring than the last. Without hesitation, I shoulder my way inside, careless of the shocked exclamations that follow me.

The cheeky shopkeeper narrows their eyes at my bold entrance but greets me with an amused grin. "Well well, if it isn't Trouble Incarnate, strutting in as if they own the joint! What can I interest you in today, darling?"

I flash a mischievous smile back, my eyes glittering with anticipation. "Show me something that will make heads spin and tongues wag when I parade down the street in it."

The shopkeeper lets out a throaty laugh, snapping their fingers in delight. "Now you're speaking my language!" They vanish into the back room, returning moments later with a garish, floor-length coat in a clashing houndstooth pattern. The puffed sleeves are studded with an array of winking faux diamonds, and the hem is embellished with several dozen round mirrors. 


"Behold, the ultimate statement piece!" the shopkeeper announces dramatically, presenting the coat like a prized peacock. "Spot-recognize it."
I burst out laughing at the sheer audacity of it, I run my hands over the coat, feeling the buttery softness of what must be very fine mink, the ever-so-slight weight of the faux gemstones and mirrors. 

"I'll take it," I declare, slipping it on with a theatrical flourish. The coat flows around me like liquid sin, the mirrors catching the light and sending dizzying reflections skittering across the walls. 

I saunter out of the store with renewed vigor, my head held high, the coat billowing behind me like a two-ton should of amiable ataxia. The city feels electric, pulsating with my audacity.

As I strut through the streets, people gape and point, their eyes following my every move. Some whisper amongst themselves, while others snap surreptitious photos with their phones. But I pay them no mind, reveling in the attention and the sheer delight of breaking the mold.

I cut through a bustling park, startling the pigeons and ruffling the lawn furniture on my way. A bemused park bench occupant has a look of abject horror on their face as I crash off the metal armrest of the bench perched next to them.

But I don't stop there. Oh no, that wouldn't be nearly enough. I kick open the door to a high-end coffee shop, sending customers and baristas alike scrambling in surprise. The cloying scent of overpriced beans and an endless array of phobic arrangements of soy/lactose options transform me into this world's most sought-after shopper.

With a wave of my hand, I clear off the chic display tables and plunk myself down at one, spreading my arms and legs wide. 

"Nachttickenschnitzel and Private Stock on tap," I declare loudly, snapping my fingers at a flummoxed barista. "And make it snappy, dearie. This divine elite party in my coat has quite a lot of shop-traveling to do today."

The barista gapes at me for a long moment, clearly torn between complying with my ridiculous request and throwing me out on my ear. In the end, they rumple a teaspoon and turn away, muttering under their breath about "dreaming without restraint"

But I don't hear any of it. I'm already lost in my own little world, sailing through the city in my garish coat, acting exactly like an irascibly offensive monarch to settle somewhere new and renovate it entirely to my own peculiar cultured eccentricity.

This is my dream, after all. And in the end, isn't that what it's all about? The freedom to lash about like a toddler in a chin-up bar, unfettered by the constraints of polite society or tiresome consequences?
