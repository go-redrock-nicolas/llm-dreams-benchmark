I am dreaming. feel a breeze coming down through the canyon and cooling off the sunbaked earth. 
The rocks are warm to the touch and the plants release their sweet aroma as the wind brushes past. 
There's so much sensory input that one might feel overwhelmed, but for me, it's a symphony of sensations.

The sun is low in the sky, casting long shadows across the canyon floor. 
The sound of birds chirping and rustling leaves echoes off the walls. 
I look forward and see a wide, rushing river
with crystal clear waters that sparkle in the fading sunlight. 
The sound of the water is rhythmic, almost hypnotic. 

I take a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill my lungs. 
My feet move effortlessly over the rocky terrain, as if they know where to go. 

As I walk closer to the water, I notice small fish darting back and forth in the shallows. 
The river is alive with activity. 

Then, I see something strange. 
There, on the other side of the river, is a tall figure standing in the shadows. 
I can't make out any features, but something about the way they stand makes my heart race.

I take a step forward, feeling the current of the river pulling at my legs. 
The figure doesn't move. 
I step onto a large rock to get a better view, but my foot slips and I fall into the river.

The water rushes over me, pulling me downstream. 
I fight against the current, trying to keep my head above water. 

As I struggle, I hear a voice in my head, calm and steady. 
"Let go," it says. 
"Trust the flow."

I stop fighting and allow myself to be carried by the current. 
It's exhilarating and terrifying all at once. 

The water swirls and twists around me, carrying me deeper into the canyon. 
I feel weightless, almost as if I'm flying.

As I drift further downstream, I see something in the distance. 
A figure standing on the bank, watching me with keen interest. 
It's the same figure I saw earlier on the other side of the river. 

The water slows and I float towards the shore, coming to a stop at the figure's feet. 
They reach out a hand, offering me help to stand up. 

I look up, noticing their calm demeanor and warm smile. 
"Who are you?" I ask.

They tilt their head to the side slightly before replying, "That's not important right now. 
What matters is that you're here, in this moment, experiencing everything around you.

"This river, this canyon, the wind on your skin, the sound of the birds... this is what it means to be alive.

"Don't forget this feeling," they say. 
"Remember it when you wake up."

And then, just like that, the dream fades away and I wake up.
