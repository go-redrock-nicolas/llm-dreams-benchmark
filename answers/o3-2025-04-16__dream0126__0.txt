I am dreaming. …feel a tremor flicker through your ribcage—a hummingbird–sized panic that beats against your sternum. The velvet curtains are parted just wide enough for you to glimpse the audience: rows upon rows of faces luminous beneath chandelier light, a tide of expectant eyes glinting like coins at the bottom of a wishing fountain. Somewhere beyond the footlights an oboe warms up, its single note curving around your spine.

Your masterpiece stands center stage: a towering triptych of translucent panels, each layered with pigments that shimmer like oil on rain-slick pavement. If anyone else looked closely, they would see only liquid fire—color melting into color, shapes defying gravity. But in this instant you notice fissures spider-webbing beneath the surface, hairline cracks that threaten to fracture the entire vision. The bottom-left quadrant sags, the cerulean wash you labored over all night pooling into a swampy bruise. A line that should arc like a comet now droops, dispirited. No one else has detected it; applause swells in anticipation. Yet once you’ve perceived the flaws you cannot unsee them—they blaze brighter than the chandeliers, louder than the oboe’s note.

Time in dreams is taffy; every heartbeat stretches to a minute, every minute contracts to a blink. You inhale, and the scent of drying paint mingles with theater dust and the distant perfume of hothouse lilies arranged along the balcony. Your palms sweat enough to leave ghostly fingerprints on the backstage curtains. A stagehand whispers, “Two seconds.” The world narrows to the weight of that sentence.

But a dream rarely obeys the tyranny of physics. Instead of collapsing, your panic ripens into a strange, reckless clarity: If flaws exist only because you perceive them, then you can also unwrite them.

You step forward, silent as moonlight, and press your right hand to the first crack. Pigment ripples like silk beneath your touch, absorbing your pulse. The audience gasps—the panels have become membranes, aquamarine skins of possibility. With your left hand you reach behind your ear, pluck an invisible brush from the air, and fling a single arc of gold across the bleeding cerulean. The flaw dissolves, swallowed by dawn-bright light. Cheers erupt, but they’re muffled, as though you’re submerged in a dream-ocean.

The stage floor tilts—a tectonic shift—and the triptych unfurls like a colossal book. Pages bloom outward, each one a different landscape: sapphire deserts where mirrored dunes sing, midnight orchards heavy with incandescent fruit, cities built on the backs of drifting whales. You walk across the panels, footprints igniting constellations in your wake. From below, the audience sees you suspended in kaleidoscopic space, painting and erasing reality with every step.

A new crack appears, this time in the sky of the whale-city. Instead of fear, curiosity pricks you. You dip your fingertip into a passing cloud, gather storm-silver pigment, and stitch the fracture closed with lightning. The cloud purrs like silk being torn then rewoven. Applause morphs into thunderous waves that crash against the proscenium.

Soon the flaws come faster—dozens, hundreds—each demanding attention. Yet now they feel less like imperfections and more like invitations. You twist flaws into fractals, coax them into spirals of neon ivy, let them hatch into phoenixes that soar out over the audience, scattering sparks that smell of cinnamon and first snow.

Finally, when every crack has either flown away or blossomed into beauty, you plant your brush in the center of the living canvas. It sprouts into a tree whose leaves are tiny mirrors. Each leaf reflects a different spectator, capturing them mid-breath, mid-wonder. They witness themselves witnessing you—an infinite hall of reverberating awe.

You bow. The chandeliers dim to a hush, then surge brighter than dawn as the crowd rises. Somewhere in the wings the oboe finds its long-hidden melody, lilting, buoyant, a ribbon tying night to morning. You exhale, and in that breath the dream folds closed like origami—flaws and all— slipping into the pocket of your waking mind, where it will glint for days like a secret gem only you can see.
