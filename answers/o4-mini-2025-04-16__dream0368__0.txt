I am dreaming. You step into the dream as a soft rainfall drapes a forest of tall, silver-barked trees. Beneath your bare feet, moss cushions every step, alive with tiny phosphorescent mushrooms that pulse in time with your heartbeat. A hush hums through the air—neither wind nor insect, but something deeper, calling you inward.  

You feel it first as a gentle tug at your chest: the longing to cast aside noise and hurry, to strip life down to its purest, brightest kernel. The urge swells, and in that instant you know you must radically simplify.  

Following this clarifying impulse, you reach down and peel away the layers you’re wearing—shadows of worry, garments of obligation, jewelry of comparison. Each piece falls silently into the moss, dissolving into faint mist. With every item shed, your lungs fill more easily; every breath tastes of possibility.  

Ahead, a narrow path of pale stones threads through the trees. You follow it until the forest opens onto a wide, still lagoon. Its surface is as smooth as glass, reflecting a sky rippling with violet and gold. You kneel and watch your own reflection: eyes clear, posture unburdened.  

At the lagoon’s edge stands a simple wooden raft, tied only by a single loop of hemp. You climb on and push off. The raft moves without oar or engine, gliding slowly across the water as if drawn by an unseen hand. Mist rises at the water’s rim, curling around your ankles.  

On the opposite shore, there is nothing but an empty field of tall, whispering grass. You step off the raft and find, nestled in the heart of the grass, a small seed—no larger than a pebble. Instinctively, you scoop it into your palm. It pulses with warmth, as if holding the sum of all you truly need.  

You plant the seed at your feet. Instantly, blades of grass fall away and a sapling springs up, slender and humming with light. Its leaves shimmer, each one bearing a word that matters most—“Love,” “Wonder,” “Presence,” “Gratitude.” A breeze stirs, and the words glow before drifting skyward like fireflies.  

The sapling’s roots deepen into the earth, and in that quiet moment you feel your life’s clutter slough off, absorbed by the soil. Past worries become compost for new growth. Old regrets sink away like stones.  

Above, the sky ripples again, streaking into sunrise orange. You stand, light as breath, wearing nothing but the wide-open space of your own clarity. In the distance, a single figure made of rippling water waves at you—a guide formed from your own simplicity. You smile and walk toward them, each step a reminder of the life you choose to keep: spacious, rich in what matters, empty of all that does not.  

And in that perfect hush, the dream holds you—light, clear, unburdened—ready to awaken into a life remade by radical simplicity.
