I am dreaming. In my dream, I am a young girl who possesses a magical power that allows me to transform into any animal I desire. One day, while wandering through a vast forest, I stumble upon a magnificent tree with glowing fruits. The word 'eternity' is etched into its trunk. As I reach out to pluck one of the fruits, I am transported to another world.

This new world is strange and wonderful. The sky is an enchanting mix of purples and pinks, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of honeysuckle. I am wearing a flowing gown made of shimmering gold fabric that feels like pure silk against my skin. Beneath my bare feet, thick grass cushions each step I take.

As I look around, I notice that the sun is beginning to set over a glistening body of water in the distance. A voice calls out to me, beckoning me towards it. I change into a majestic white horse and gallop towards the sound.

When I reach the water's edge, I find myself standing before an ageless goddess who floats gracefully on a golden raft. She introduces herself as the keeper of dreams and time. She explains that humanity is facing a crisis; they are forgetting how to dream. I realize that this is why I was brought here.

The goddess challenges me to collect dreams from all corners of the world before dawn breaks. If I succeed, she promises to restore balance to humanity. She gives me a magical horn filled with fairy dust that allows me to travel instantly to different dreams and collect them.

I wake up from my dream, feeling invigorated and full of purpose. My heart beats rapidly as I remember the goddess's challenge. With resolve in my heart, I reach for my notebook and pen, ready to start dreaming up solutions to save humanity.
