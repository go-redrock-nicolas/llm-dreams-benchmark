I am dreaming. You're exploring ancient catacombs when your only light source, an old lantern held shakily in your quivering hands, begins to flicker unpredictably. As the darkness grows more absolute and disorienting with each fleeting spark, you desperately clutch the lantern tighter, willing it not to die.

The damp stone walls surrounding you are covered in ancient frescos, their once-vibrant hues dimmed by centuries of dust and decay. The air clings with musty scents of age and forgotten histories.

The light sputters once more and fades completely. You're plunged into suffocating darkness, unable to see your own hand before your face. A suffocating panic rises up in your chest as you hear the faint distant echoes of movement through the endless tunnels ahead.

Your trembling fingers fumble desperately with the lantern, trying to reignite it as unseen things scuttle and scrape in the darkness. With a small miracle, a weak flame flickers back to life, casting eerie shadows that dance menacingly on the walls.
