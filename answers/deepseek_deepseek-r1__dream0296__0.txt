I am dreaming. You stand in a labyrinth of shifting, honeycombed mirrors, each pane framed in twisted silver and glowing faintly like bioluminescent coral. Your breath fogs the air—odd, since the atmosphere feels thick and humid, like breathing through wet velvet. There, in a fractured mirror streaked with liquid mercury and volcanic obsidian, your reflection tilts its head at a wrong angle. Its eyes are galaxy-black, swallowing light, while yours (weren’t they hazel yesterday?) burn amber, slit-pupiled and feral.

You raise a hand—a stranger’s hand, all elongated fingers and opalescent scales creeping up the wrist—and the reflection mimics you a heartbeat too late. Its mouth moves without sound, lips shaping words that scorch the glass: *You’re forgetting*. The room lurches. Mirrors splinter into prismatic shards that hang suspended, each fragment reflecting a different version of you—a child clutching a moth-eaten stuffed owl, an elder with roots instead of hair, a being of pure starlight screaming into the void.  

The floor liquifies. You sink into warm, sentient ooze that hums an ancient lullaby. Shadows braid themselves around your ankles, whispering secrets in a language of crackling embers and wind-chimes. When you claw toward the surface, your reflection grips your shoulders—only now it’s no longer a mirror but a living twin, its skin etched with glowing runes that pulse in time with your racing heart.  

“This is the shape you’ve outgrown,” it hisses, and its voice is your voice layered with a thousand others. The world implodes into a single, blinding point of light—and for one vertiginous moment, you feel your edges dissolve, molecules unraveling into stardust.  

Then you wake. Your hands tremble, still half-convinced they’re clawed and shimmering.
