I am dreaming. …I drift outward, and the borders of “I” dissolve like sugar in warm rain.  

At first there is only breath—slow, tidal, omnidirectional. It fills my lungs but also the hollow stems of grasses, the spiraling chambers of snails, the bright-laced wings of moths. With each inhalation thousands of green apertures—stomata—open in unison, as though the world has synchronized its lungs with mine.  

The forest materializes next: towering columns of cedar and Douglas-fir, their bark furrowed like the pages of an ancient atlas. Sunlight arrives not in ordinary rays but in miles-long ribbons, fluttering and translucent, caught on every needle and fern. Where the ribbons touch my skin I feel photosynthesis occur beneath my own epidermis; chlorophyll blooms in my veins, and glucose—sweet, clean fire—courses through muscle and bone.

I step forward, yet the ground itself seems to rise to meet me—spongy mats of moss, constellations of fungi, marbled roots spiraling in slow, dignified dances beneath the soil. I sense the mycelial conversations underfoot: a billion silver filaments whispering water, minerals, even rumors of insect predation from one tree to the next. The trees reply with a soft surge of sap, gratitude passing like a warm pulse through the network. For the first time I comprehend that the woods are not a collection of individuals but a single, breathing sentence, elegantly unbroken for ten thousand years.

A hush falls. Out of that silence a river unspools, gleaming like hammered moonlight. I kneel to drink, and within each droplet is an entire sky—clouds shaped like migrating cranes, storms coiling like ammonites, stars flickering in miniature. When the water touches my tongue it speaks: “You are 70 percent me. We are one eddy wearing different masks.” My heart answers by adopting the river’s rhythm—steady, unhurried, persistent.

Now the dream lifts me as effortlessly as a thermal lifts a red-tailed hawk. I find myself soaring over a quilt of biomes stitched together with silver mountain ridges: rain forest, savanna, desert, tundra. In every place my awareness unfurls simultaneously, discovering that lichens on Arctic rock carry faint desert memories, that ocean plankton hum stories of prairie grass, that the exhalations of one hemisphere become the inhalations of the other. Boundaries crack and crumble; the Earth is revealed as a single organ, flexing and sighing in cosmic time.

I pass into the open ocean, suspended just beneath the surface where sunlight scatters like shattered emeralds. All around me, leviathan whale songs ripple—deep vowels too vast for vocal cords alone. I feel those notes resonate in my sternum, suturing me to every cetacean heart pulsing in the saltwater. A blue whale glides beneath, a moving continent, and in its shadow I learn humility so profound it is indistinguishable from awe.

The dream deepens. I shrink to the scale of mitochondria, drifting through the ballroom of a single leaf cell, where minuscule suns—chloroplasts—spin like green lanterns. Here the language is molecular, but the message is identical: collaboration, reciprocity, communion. Even subatomic quarks appear to be waltzing, exchanging colors and charges with exquisite courtesy.

Suddenly I am back in the forest clearing, twilight unfolding overhead. Fireflies ignite, and each pulse is a syllable in the same radiant mantra, repeated by crickets, echoed by distant owl calls, underlined by the bass thrum of bullfrogs. Above, the Milky Way stretches, not as a far-off ceiling but as a dendritic extension of the very mycelial net beneath my feet—stars and spores mirroring each other across the vault of existence.

A wind arrives, cool and evergreen. It sweeps through my body as though I am made of reeds, and for a luminous instant I feel the hard and gentle truth: I have never been separate. Every cell, every breath, every electrical murmur in my brain is a collaboration between biomes, epochs, galaxies. The dream shows me a fleeting mathematical clarity—that the number of atoms in my hand once belonged to supernovae, iguanodons, volcanic ash, and tomorrow will belong to children I’ll never meet.

The vision closes in a slow fade. The forest dims but never disappears; it simply folds itself into a secret chamber behind my waking eyelids, ready to reopen whenever I recall the scent of cedar or the hush of moss.  

And as dawn seeps into the corners of the dream, a final whisper arrives on the wind: “Carry us in your heartbeat. Protect what you are.”
