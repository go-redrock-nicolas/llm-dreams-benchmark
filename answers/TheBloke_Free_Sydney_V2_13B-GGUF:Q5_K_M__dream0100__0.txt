I am dreaming. 

You join a close-knit community with complex social dynamics that have developed over generations. As you try to find your place within these established relationships, you encounter jealousy and competition from other dreams who resent your presence and power. They band together against you in an attempt to isolate and weaken you. 

You must navigate through this hostile environment while also trying to form alliances with friendly dreams who share common interests and goals. You have limited resources and time, so you must make wise decisions about how you allocate them. 

Suddenly, a powerful Dream Censor appears on the horizon. It threatens to destroy all dreams who don't comply with its rules and regulations. The community is divided on whether to submit or rebel against it. You have to choose a side and take action before it's too late.
