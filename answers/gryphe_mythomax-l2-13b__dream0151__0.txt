I am dreaming. Find myself in a strange, high-tech facility. As I turn the corner, I see a group of people huddled around a table. They look up at me as I approach, their expressions a mix of curiosity and doubt.

"You are awfully young to be in charge of us," says a woman with short red hair. She glances at the other members of the team, nodding in agreement.

"And you have no experience in our field," adds a man with a thick accent. He leans back in his chair, crossed arms resting on his chest.

I try to keep my cool. "That's true," I admit. "But I do have a knack for leadership and problem-solving. And you all have the expertise needed to get the job done."

They continue to stare at me, unconvinced. I take a deep breath and decide to change the subject. "So, what are we working on?"

The man with the thick accent smirks. "You really don't know, do you?" 

He gestures towards the table, where a large machine sits in the center. "This is a device that can manipulate space-time," he says. "We're trying to figure out how to harness its power for, well... for some very important things."

My heart races as I look at the machine. "Wow," I manage to say. "That's incredible."

The team exchanges glances, clearly surprised by my reaction. Maybe they're starting to see me in a new light.

As we discuss the finer points of the machine's design, I can't help but feel a sense of awe. This is the kind of work that inspires people, that changes the world. And even though I'm still learning, I'm determined to contribute everything I can to this extraordinary undertaking.

The dream fades, leaving me with a feeling of exhilaration and purpose.
