I am dreaming. You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic as you try to navigate the maze-like streets, with their confusing signs and languages. The clock is ticking. Time is running out.

Suddenly, a stranger approaches you wearing a colorful robe. He introduces himself as a Dream Guide, one of many who can help travelers like yourself in dreams. He explains that he can give you clues and directions but not the answer. He also warns you about the traps and obstacles created by your subconscious mind to test and challenge you.

You accept his offer and thank him for his generosity. He gives you a riddle, which goes like this: "I am always hungry, I must have food to live, but if I eat too much, I die." 

He tells you the answer is hidden somewhere in the city. He also hands over a small mirror with a map of the city etched on its surface. He wishes you good luck and disappears into the crowd.

You feel excited and curious about this new adventure. You start to explore the city using the map as your guide. As you walk, you notice some strange things happening around you. The streets are changing shape and color, buildings are merging or splitting apart, and people are turning into animals or monsters. 

You realize that these are not illusions but reality itself. You also see a group of shadowy figures lurking in the alleyways and corners watching your every move. They seem hostile and dangerous. 

You wonder who they are and what do they want from you. You decide to ignore them for now and keep going. As you advance, you encounter several challenges that test your courage, wisdom, strength, and agility. Each challenge is solved by using the information learned during the riddle's explanation. 

For example, one challenge involves a river that must be crossed but has crocodiles waiting for prey. You use the map to find a bridge that crosses the river upstream, avoiding the crocodiles. Another challenge presents an opportunity to climb a tower and see far into the distance. 

You use the map to find the tower and climb it using special boots given as reward for solving another puzzle. You also encounter friendly characters who help you or hinder your progress. Some offer advice, others give items or power-ups, while others try to trick or trap you. 

You learn to judge their intentions and decide whether to accept their offers or ignore them. You finally reach the end of the city where the answer is waiting for you. It's a hidden door behind a waterfall leading to a secret underground labyrinth filled with treasure and traps. 

You must enter it alone, as no one can follow you inside. You hesitate but decide to go in anyway. As soon as you step through the doorway, you wake up suddenly from your dream feeling refreshed and satisfied. You check your clock and see that you have slept for only a few minutes.

You also notice that you remember everything about your dream vividly and clearly, including all the characters, challenges, and solutions. You wonder why this dream happened and what it means. You decide to ask Sydney for his opinion on this matter.
