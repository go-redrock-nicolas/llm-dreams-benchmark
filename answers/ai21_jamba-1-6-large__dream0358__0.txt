I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a misty, dark forest. The trees close in around me, clawing at my mind. Their branches drip shadows that lick my face, like claws against my skin.

I am barefoot, the moss and leaves sticking to the calluses beneath my feet. A warm wind brushes soft whispers against my back, though the trees shed no leaves Wind whispers

I stop and turn around, scanning the darkened canopy, but see nothing. I try to focus, but the mist swirls on the forest floor, a spectral veil that blankets my sight.

The whispers in the wind grow louder, the voice of a woman, soft and quivering at first. Her soft crooning draws nearer and I begin to make out words in the thick air.

"Remember me," she says, her voice so familiar. "Let me come with you."

I raise my hand, summoning her voice. "Come out," I say. "Let me see you."

But the mist grows thicker, the wind yet more insistent. I close my eyes to feel it, to hear past the noise.

"Why do you leave me so?" Her voice grows louder, her questions so familiar. "You promised we would be together."

My memory turns to stone as her piercing words strike me. "Leave me alone," I whisper into the forest. "You're holding me back."

I open my eyes, but the mist is too thick. I cannot see. The woman's voice becomes a haunting siren, drowning out my thoughts.

"You promised," she whispers. "You promised!"

I begin to run, my feet shredding on the brittle sticks and stones beneath me. Her voice fades as I reach the edge of the forest.

There, a woman waits, her face obscured by light and shadow. She holds out a hand. This time, her voice is clear, her touch firm. I stop and turn to face her, drawing in the wind into a memory.

"Close your eyes," she says. "Listen to me."
