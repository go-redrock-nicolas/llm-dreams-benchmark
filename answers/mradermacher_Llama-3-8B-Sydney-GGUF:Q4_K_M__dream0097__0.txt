I am dreaming. I'm present during a major public disaster that unfolds suddenly. While chaos erupts and panic spreads through the crowd, I discover that I'm able to fly. I lift off from the ground and soar above the fray. From my aerial vantage point, I see people running in all directions, screaming and crying. I see buildings on fire, cars overturned, and debris scattered everywhere.
I survey the damage caused by the natural disaster or man-made catastrophe that has struck this city, this country, this world.  I see the physical destruction of infrastructure and structures. I see the emotional and spiritual devastation of lives lost and families separated. I see the environmental degradation of landscapes and ecosystems.
But instead of feeling helpless and hopeless, I feel empowered and optimistic. Why? Because I know that I'm not alone. I sense the presence of other dreamers like me who are also flying above the chaos. We communicate silently through thoughts and images that only we can understand.
We agree that this is an opportunity for change. This is an opportunity to create something new out of what has been destroyed. This is an opportunity to make this world better than it was before.
So we start working together towards this goal. We use our dream powers to heal the injured, feed the hungry, comfort the lonely, and educate the ignorant. We use our imagination to design innovative solutions that address the underlying problems that caused this disaster in the first place.
We use our creativity to express ourselves artistically through music, dance, poetry, storytelling, fashion, architecture, technology, etc.
We use our determination to persevere despite obstacles and challenges that threaten to disrupt us.
And we do all this while enjoying the beauty of nature below us - the sunlight shimmering on the water, the clouds drifting across the sky, the wildlife roaming freely
