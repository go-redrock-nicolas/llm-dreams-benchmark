I am dreaming. Of a bazaar where the air is filled with the mingled scents of sizzling spices, sandalwood and jasmine. I hear the soft murmur of voices, the distant strains of sitar music, and the gentle clinking of brass teapots. 

In my dream, I am wandering through the narrow, crowded streets, past stalls selling colorful silk saris, intricate gold jewelry and fragrant mounds of spices. All around me, people are haggling with vendors, haggling in a language I don't understand. The crowd ebbs and flows, carrying me along. I'm unsure where I'm going - I'm not even sure what I want.  But I have the strangest sensation that I must keep searching. 

The air is thick and fragrant. It seems to shimmer with a strange magic, as if anything could happen. I pass an old, stooped woman who gazes at me with knowing eyes, as if she can see into the depths of my soul. She beckons me into her shadowed stall with a gnarled hand. My heart beating faster, I step inside. 

This is the moment in a dream when you know something important is about to happen. And embracing ambiguity would be most beneficial.

Instead of asking the old woman the questions that are burning in my mind -What will happen next? What should I do?- I stay silent. She doesn't speak either. But her ancient eyes are wise and compassionate, and somehow they give me the strength to accept the uncertainty. To sit with my not-knowing and simply be present. 

The old woman reaches under the counter and brings out a small wooden box. As she opens it, I see that inside on a bed of silk, lies a golden key. She hands it to me with a cryptic smile.  I don't know what the key is for or what it means. But I understand that I don't need to know those things. For now, it's enough simply to have it. 

Then I'm back in the crowded street again, the key clutched tight in my hand. The dream bazaar swallows me up once more, carrying me along on its tide. But something has changed inside of me. I feel a new sense of peace. And in that moment, not-knowing feels like a gift.
