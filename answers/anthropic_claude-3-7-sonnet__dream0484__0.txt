I am dreaming. I'm walking through the familiar corridors of my childhood home, but something feels different tonight. The walls seem to breathe with a subtle pulse, and the air carries whispers of forgotten memories. My fingers trail along the wallpaper, which ripples beneath my touch like water.

I reach a door I've never noticed before—small, intricately carved with symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when I look directly at them. When I push it open, I step not into a room but onto a vast plateau overlooking an impossible landscape where mountains float untethered from the earth and oceans curl upward into the sky.

A mirror stands alone in the center of this plateau, its frame twisted from roots and branches that continue growing even as I approach. My reflection appears normal at first, but then begins to change—shoulders straightening, eyes brightening with a confidence I've never possessed. The reflection speaks: "You were never meant to be small."

Suddenly I understand. The belief that I lack courage—the story I've carried since childhood that I am somehow fundamentally afraid—begins to unravel like thread pulled from a sweater. Each memory I've interpreted as evidence of my cowardice plays back before me, but now viewed through different eyes. What I saw as fear was actually wisdom; what I judged as hesitation was thoughtfulness.

As this realization washes over me, the mirror shatters—not violently, but transforming into thousands of luminous butterflies that swirl around me. Each carries a fragment of my reflection, but stronger, braver, more authentic than before. I feel myself expanding beyond the boundaries I've drawn around my life.

The landscape responds to my transformation. Trees rise from barren ground where I step, blooming instantly into full grandeur. I find myself running, then soaring above the impossible geography, no longer bound by the gravity of self-doubt. Mountains bow as I pass; rivers change course to follow my flight.

Before waking, I understand with perfect clarity: I have always been the author of my limitations, and now—finally—I am free to write a different story.
