I am dreaming. The world around me is a swirling kaleidoscope of colours, a breathtaking panorama painted with hues I've never witnessed in my waking life. The air hums with a low, melodious thrum, like the distant song of celestial beings. I find myself standing on what appears to be a vast, crystalline platform suspended amidst a nebula of sparkling stardust. Below, galaxies spiral in silent, majestic dances, their light casting shifting, ethereal patterns across the platform's surface.

Then, through the cosmic ballet, two figures emerge, familiar and beloved. They are my dearest friends, Alex and Ben, their forms shimmering slightly, as if woven fr**om** the very starlight surrounding us. But their usual warmth and camaraderie are absent, replaced by a palpable tension that crackles in the dream-space between them.

Their voices, usually vessels of laughter and shared secrets, are sharp, dissonant notes in the celestial symphony. Alex, typically the calm and measured one, gestures emphatically, their starlight form flickering with agitation. "You always do this, Ben! You twist things, make it seem like I'm the one being unreasonable!"

Ben, whose jovial nature is usually as constant as the North Star, counters with uncharacteristic harshness, his own form pulsing with a stormy, indigo light. "Me? You're the one who refuses to see it fr**om** my perspective! It's like talking to a brick wall, a very stubborn, glittering brick wall!"

Their words echo across the crystalline expanse, each syllable landing like a tiny, sharp shard. The vibrant colours of the nebula seem to dim slightly, the harmonious thrum faltering as their discord grows. It's a heart-wrenching sight – these two souls, so intrinsically linked in my waking life, now stand worlds apart on this cosmic stage, their bond stretching thin and taut like a fraying silver thread.

Suddenly, the argument ceases. A heavy silence descends, broken only by the faint, receding hum of the cosmos. Both Alex and Ben turn towards me, their shimmering faces etched with conflicting emotions – anger, hurt, and a desperate plea for validation. Their eyes, pools of liquid starlight, fix on mine, expectant.

The weight of their gazes is immense, a tangible pressure in the dreamscape. They stand poised, waiting for me to cast the deciding vote, to choose a side, to mend or shatter the fragile remnants of their connection. The crystalline platform beneath my feet seems to hum with anticipation, the swirling galaxies below holding their breath.

I am caught in the crossfire of their celestial storm, the arbiter of a conflict I desperately wish didn't exist. The vibrant, wondrous dreamscape suddenly feels vast and lonely, and the choice before me looms as large and complex as the universe itself. The silence stretches, thick with unspoken words and the heavy burden of expectation, leaving me suspended in a moment of profound, starlit uncertainty.
