I am dreaming. In this strange world, you discover a hidden gem—a library that houses the forbidden logic of the "real world." The books are covered in vibrant neon colors and emit a gentle hum when touched. Each page is filled with diagrams, equations, and maps that defy the laws of this society. As you flip through the pages, you feel a rush of power and control over your surroundings. You learn how to communicate with objects, making them dance, sing, or even change shape.

The world shifts before your eyes: instead of being confined to a dreary, gray landscape, vibrant colors burst forth from the ground, and the air sparkles with tiny motes of light. You can fly, and with a thought, you soar above the clouds, leaving the oppressive atmosphere behind. Below, you see the world as it truly is—a chaotic yet beautiful tapestry of overlapping dreams and realities.
