I am dreaming. 

You've risen through grueling qualifiers to the championship match that represents the culmination of your life's ambition. As you prepare for the defining moment, you feel a surge of energy and determination. You know this is it - one last chance to prove yourself. 

You step onto the stage in front of a roaring crowd. The arena lights dim, and spotlights illuminate the center of the ring. A cue plays, signaling the start of the round. You hear the sound of cocking guns as your opponent appears from shadows. 

You brace yourself for the inevitable. Your heart beats faster, and sweat gathers on your forehead. The countdown begins, and the timer disappears. The gunshots echo through the arena, and pain engulfs you. You fall to the ground, covered in blood. 

You wake up with a start, gasping for air. Your heart races, and your body shakes. You try to calm down by taking slow deep breaths. But then, you realize something strange. 

This wasn't just a dream. This was a prophecy. A vision of your future. A foreshadowing of your death.
