I am dreaming. Or perhaps I have simply fallen into a memory I never lived, a place stitched together from fragments of myth, forgotten languages, and futures that tremble on the edge of possibility. 

I am in the city of **Elythra**, a place suspended between twilight and flame, where towers curve upward like the spines of sleeping gods, glowing faintly from within. The sky is a kaleidoscope woven with serpentine ribbons of color—emerald, violet, silver—that writhe occasionally, as if breathing alongside the city below. There is no sun, only an orb of shifting features called **The Citizen**, a collective consciousness that observes and approves or forgets, but never forgives.

In Elythra, society operates under the **Tripartic Veil**. Everyone wears masks—not of fabric or steel, but of perception. One’s identity, status, and even gender shift depending on the status of those around them, judged by how they move, speak, and most importantly, remember. To speak someone’s name is a sacred act, revealing you know their true face, both metaphor and literal—names are rarely given here; they are *earned*, through narrative, memory, or sacrifice.

I wake, or arrive, wearing a **Cerulean Half-Mantle**, marking me as *Anamnesis-Seeker*—I am in training to become a Storybroker, one who weaves memories into reality, who threads forgotten histories into the present so that Elythra may breathe. The Veil is delicate, and only those deeply attuned to it can manipulate its strands without tearing the city apart from within.

I begin my journey through the **Spiral Slopes**, an endless series of stairs inside a floating chamberless temple, where those ascending must walk always above, those descending must bow and remain still. I accidentally touch the hand of another Aspirant while moving upward. They wear Gilded Chain-Whispers; their status seven layers higher than mine.

I hear the snap before I feel the silence.

A flicker in the air—a translucent barrier rises between us. A *Sundering Bell* pulses from the sky, its toll felt more than heard. I have violated the **Protocol of Echoed Contact**: to physically touch one with Veil Superior resonance is to steal a grain of their Light. Even unintentionally, the matter is cosmic. All intentions in Elythra are *felt* in the Aether.

Two **Morbilune Sentinals** materialize in swirls of ash-silk. Their masks are empty but unblinking. They speak not words, but visions: representative contracts of my transgression, the debt I owe to the Equilibrium.

I am not exiled. No, the punishment here is subtler, grander, more shattering.

I am **Unshadowed**.

It means, simply, that no one will remember that I existed—not as a person, not even as a moment. My presence ceases to leave footprints, my voice no longer echoes in ears. It is the penultimate erasure before dissolution. Only a single desperate path remains.

I must find **the Wound That Remembers**: a sentient fault line beneath the Obsidian Library, where discarded memories and forgotten gods spiral in endless contraflow. There, I must convince one of these exile-souls—a defective goddess named *Vynah*, once Elythra’s muse of vertical love—to grant me a shard of her last true fragment: memory steeped in irony so pure it once caused civilizations to weep into song.

The journey is not linear—pathways open only when I remember something *painfully true* about myself that I’ve hidden even from my own mind. My shadow peels from my body like a cloak, being bid farewell by a gust of remembering.

One test requires me to recite a lullaby I had long since repressed—sung only by a mother I believed never existed, yet do. Another asks me to accept a gift from a child made of candlewax and ambition, though receiving anything in Elythra binds me to a vow.

I arrive at the Obsidian Library during the *Croonfall*, a sacred season when storytelling bleeds into reality and the air smells of ink that dreams in Braille. The doors open only when I project my shame, biggest and blackest, into the Memorial Bath that waits at the threshold. I weep into the pool, and from those tears rises Vynah.

She is not monstrous. Not in the way one fears. She’s a garden of sound in human shape, humming songs so ancient the library shelves shiver with forgotten titles. I present my suit for remembrance in a ritual of reversed faces and mirrored silence. She asks me what I’ve learned.

I whisper: “That forgetting may protect, but remembrance sanctifies. I sought truth in power, but found it in vulnerability. To remember is not to cling. To be remembered is not a right—it’s a gift bestowed through fidelity to authenticity, even in shame.”

She smiles.

Darkness swallows the exchange, as though it never happened.

I wake in my real bed, the scent of candlewax in the air, a single silver thread… no, a hair I do not recognize… curled on my pillow.

Did I truly forget?

Or was I simply *forgiven*?
