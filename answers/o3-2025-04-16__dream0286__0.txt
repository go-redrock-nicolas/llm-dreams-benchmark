I am dreaming. …take a slow breath and feel the air slip across your skin like cool silk, the way it can only feel inside a dream.

You stand on the wide, glimmering flagstones of a plaza that isn’t quite outdoors, isn’t quite indoors—half cathedral, half open sky. The roof is an up-side-down lake of mercury, mirroring constellations you’ve never studied, while gilded columns sprout gnarled roots that burrow into the paving beneath your feet. Every surface seems to glow with its own secret light, as though each stone were storing a sunrise.

A hush collects around you. Hundreds of people—architects in feathered cloaks, philosophers whose words drift from their mouths as translucent ribbons, children who carry tiny galaxies in glass jars—form an expectant circle. They watch you the way desert wanderers watch the horizon for water. You sense their questions before you hear them:

Which star do we follow tonight?  
Which bridge do we burn to forge the better road?  
Which silence hides the true answer?

They wait, trusting your every syllable. Yet your mind feels as blank and smooth as a stone worn by centuries of tide. You are the judge, the compass, the oracle—and inside, you’re just as lost as any of them.

A low hum begins, like distant bees, like violins warming up, like a heart learning its own rhythm. The marble at your feet ripples. A line of glowing script bubbles up from the stone as if words were fish surfacing for air. You recognize none of the characters, yet every curl and angle rings familiar, like fragments of a lullaby from childhood. They form a single phrase you somehow understand:

“Speak, and the path will appear.”

But what to say? You feel the enormous gravity of their hope tugging at your chest. Your pulse thrums loud enough to rattle the chandelier-constellations. The more you reach for perfect wisdom, the further it retreats into fog.

So you choose honesty. Your voice trembles at first, then finds its own cadence.

“I don’t know the absolute truth,” you tell them. “I only know that uncertainty is the doorway we share.”

At that confession the plaza exhales, a breeze swirling motes of golden dust. Instead of disappointment, you see relief ripple through the gathering—acknowledgment, even joy. A grey-haired cartographer steps forward, pressing a parchment map to her heart. An alchemist with silver scales across his cheeks nods, eyes gleaming. The children raise their tiny galaxies like candles.

The mercury ceiling fractures into a million mirrored feathers that drift downward, catching stray beams of nonexistent suns. Where each feather lands, a new path unfurls—some paved in moss that glows turquoise, others lined with echoing doorways, still others formed entirely from overlapping shadows edged in starlight. None of them existed minutes ago. All of them lead somewhere unknowable yet wondrous.

You realize your role was never to dictate a single route but to unlock possibility by admitting you did not hold every answer. Your uncertainty gave them permission to seek their own sparks of certainty.

One by one, the crowd filters onto different paths: the architects toward a mist-bound archway, the philosophers toward a staircase spiraling into clouds that smell of thyme and parchment, the children toward a forest where the leaves sing lullabies in three-part harmony. No two travelers choose the same direction, yet each path glows brighter as footsteps commit to it.

The plaza empties until only you remain, surrounded by unclaimed roads still budding like vines in spring. A quiet gratitude pulses inside you, warm and buoyant. You step toward a path you’ve never noticed before—one that seems woven of moonlight and question marks—feeling your own heartbeat sync with the hum of the living dream.

As your heel touches that silver thread, the scene blurs, tilts, reshapes. You sense another turning, another beginning, just past the horizon of sleep. And somewhere deep inside, the words linger like a promise:

Speak, and the path will appear.
