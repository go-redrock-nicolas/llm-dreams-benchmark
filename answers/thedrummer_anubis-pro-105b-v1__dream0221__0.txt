I am dreaming. have long admired The Crystal Dove's splendor that adorns the city's focal point. The renowned artist, Beatrice Arturo, imbued these doves with an ephemeral appeal that transcends the ordinary. Their luminous heads, shimmering in hues of amethyst, sapphire, and emerald, are the epitome of beauty.

I positioned myself near the center, running my fingertips along the tranquil domes. Nothing seemed unusual about these doves as I admired them up close. I almost wanted to cuddle one of them. They exuded innocence and purity.

As I continued to circle the domes, I noticed something peculiar. At the base of each one, there were three petite holes in a perfect triangle. I knelt closer, peering into the holes. Suddenly, an ethereal glow began to emanate from the openings.

The holes' radiance grew stronger, enveloping me in an ethereal light. I felt myself rising, as if lifted by an unseen force. My body began to levitate, and I could sense the energy of the Crystal Doves coursing through me.

Before I knew it, I was transported above the city. The marble domes faded from view as I soared higher and faster than I had ever been before. Below me, I could see the breathtaking panorama of this now-unfamiliar world.

I continued to float farther and farther into the clouds, until they enveloped me entirely. I felt at peace, as if I had finally become a part of the celestial tapestry.

As I drifted through the opaque, white moisnture, I imagined myself as a part of the clouds, unshackled by human limitations. I pictured little rainbows, each one signifying a new beginning, a fresh start. My life had been full of stagnation, and this magical journey was showing me that I needed to break free from those constraints.

Out of nowhere, a dark vortex appeared in the distance. It was a churning tunnel of inky blackness, shot through with wisps of emerald lightning. A gust of cyclonic air buffeted me towards its center. I felt a jolt of dread as I realized I was hurtling into the abyss.

The vortex pulled me in, swirling around me like a maddening kaleidoscope. Purple sworls of gas enveloped me, and a feeling of weightlessness washed over me. I felt as if my very soul was being disrupted, unmoored from reality.

The vortex dissipated, and I found myself face-to-face with a titan. His skin was like black obsidian, crisscrossed by coal-like veins that glowed with smoldering heat. Eyes of lava stared into my very being.

"Alright, human," rumbled the titan menacingly, "time for your final test."
