I am dreaming. …I take one trembling breath and feel it reverberate through a landscape that should not exist. The wind smells of wet ash, salt, and—impossibly—gardenias, like the way memory sometimes perfumes grief. Shredded siding flaps from the skeletons of houses like ragged prayer flags, and puddles flash with oily rainbows under a sullen sky. My shoes crunch over what was once the floor of my kitchen: broken plates, bent forks, a ceramic coffee mug split perfectly in half so the painted sunrise on its rim now looks like sunset.

Then the dream slips sideways, as dreams do.

The horizon yawns open and the shattered neighborhood folds inward, origami-style, rebuilding itself—but not into streets or cul-de-sacs. Instead, the splintered timber and splashed-out paint rise and refit into an enormous wooden ark. It creaks and groans, but it is undeniably alive, its hull lacquered with fresh rain and streaks of cobalt blue. I feel a tug behind my sternum, a gravitational pull both terrifying and magnetic. The ark beckons.

I climb a gangway of tilted front doors, doorknobs glinting like brass constellations. Inside, the corridors are lit by bioluminescent jellyfish drifting in glass globes nailed to the walls. Their glow stitches starry freckles across my hands. Each cabin I peer into contains an artifact of the life I lost: my childhood bicycle, somehow undented; the quilt my grandmother made, edges singed; a photograph of my street before the storm, the colors bleeding outward so it looks painted in watercolors.

As I walk, water rises around my ankles—lukewarm, silky—as if the ark has already set sail on a sea that pours from nowhere. The hall stretches into infinity yet coils around me in spirals, like a nautilus shell built from memories. With each step, the water deepens: shin, knee, waist. I panic, stupidly patting my pockets for a life jacket. That’s when a voice whispers from the rafters, “Remember, this is dreamwater; it carries, not drowns.”

I exhale and let myself float. The water buoys me into a vaulted chamber where the roof is missing, replaced by nothing but swirling storm clouds stitched with lightning. There, adrift in the middle of the room, is my favorite oak tree from the backyard—upright, impossible, its roots dangling free like loosened threads. Fireflies orbit its branches, each one flickering with a different scene:

• Me at six, holding a popsicle, barefoot in summer grass.  
• My parents leaning over a puzzle, heads nearly touching, quietly laughing.  
• The neighbor’s dog wagging in a sunbeam.  

When I reach toward a firefly, the dream slows, thickens. Touching it would mean re-living whatever glows inside. I want to clutch them all, but the moment I close my hand, the fireflies drift just beyond my fingertips, leading me upward.

The oak cracks open into a spiral staircase carved directly into its trunk, sap glimmering like amber stained glass. I climb. Halfway up, I notice that each step is engraved with a single word: “loss,” “still,” “hope,” “becomes,” “seed.” I recite them aloud, and the syllables feel like a heartbeat resetting inside my chest.

At the top of the tree, instead of leaves, there is an entire sky made of stained glass: shards of cerulean storms, panels of soft dawn pink, slivers of gold sun. I push against it, and it swings open like a cathedral window into a limitless firmament.

And suddenly, I am no longer inside the ark. I’m soaring above it on a warm updraft that smells of petrichor and lilac. Below, the wreckage-turned-vessel glides across an ocean of clouds, cutting a white ribbon wake. Somewhere far ahead, a sunrise the color of molten copper melts across the horizon.

I realize, with the lucid clarity only dreams can grant, that everything lost has been repurposed—broken boards into boats, memories into fireflies, grief into water that lifts instead of sinks. Even in ruin, something architects a passage forward.

I open my hands, and the fireflies I could not catch earlier rise from my palms like sparks, scattering into the dawn. Their glow paints fresh constellations across the thinning night sky. One cluster rearranges itself into the outline of a house—my house—its roof intact, smoke curling cheerfully from its chimney. It lingers, bright and tentative, then fades, but I understand: it is a promise, not a reminder.

A final roll of thunder hums under my feet. The dreamwater drains away, the ark dissolves into sunlight, and I am standing once more on the ruined street—yet everything is silent, serene. I kneel, brush aside ash, and discover a tiny green shoot pushing through the cracked pavement, its leaves quivering with new life.

I wake with the salt of the dream-sea on my lips and the ghostlight of fireflies behind my eyes, knowing loss has translated itself into the language of beginnings.
