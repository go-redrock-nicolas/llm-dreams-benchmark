I am dreaming.

I step, barefoot, into a glowing circle beneath a violet sky spackled with swirling constellations. Here, starlight trickles like rain, and the air smells of lavender and possibility. Around me, a diverse assembly gathers—some adorned in luminous robes streaming with delicate patterns; others wrapped in soft, earthly fabrics, their faces familiar yet tinged with ethereal understanding.

These are the travelers who have walked every thorny path I now stumble upon. Their eyes are gentle embers, burning with compassion and the memory of old wounds turned to wisdom. When they speak, their voices ripple the air as if they are pouring warm honey into my heart.

One, an elderly woman with a mane of silver curls, lifts her hands. From her palms float iridescent butterflies, each the echo of a lesson learned. She tells me: “I once felt the weight you feel, the aching doubt nesting in my bones. It softened only when I tended gently to my own heart, as if nurturing the roots of a delicate flower.”

Another, a young man with laughter lines carved by years of sunlight, offers me a glimmering stone. “The world tried to convince me I was not enough,” he murmurs. “But I learned my worth was always sparkling beneath the dust—patient, unstoppable.” I feel the warmth of the stone thrum into my palm.

Around me, wisdom rains in colors. A fierce mother, her voice wrapped in velvet, insists, “Trust the slow unfolding. Even the longest twilight yields to dawn. Tend to yourself as nightfall tends the moon—soft, relentless.” An artist, her hands stained in pigment, weaves, “Let pain turn to paint—let sorrow become song.”

Their words—my future memories—settle onto me like a silken cloak. I close my eyes and sense the strength that has brought me here, that will carry me forward. Every voice is a lantern, and their stories braid themselves into an intricate thread of hope, cinched tightly around my heart.

I am not lost. I am gathering the glimmering pieces of their wisdom, and in my dream, I feel, at last, the hush of true understanding begin to dawn.
