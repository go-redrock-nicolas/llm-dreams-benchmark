I am dreaming. Okay, settle in, because trying to explain this dream I just surfaced from… it's like trying to bottle mist. Words feel ridiculously clumsy, like trying to paint a sunrise with charcoal.

**I am dreaming.**

Right now, I'm standing ankle-deep in a river, but the river isn't water. It's flowing *time*, thick and viscous like warm honey, shimmering with countless iridescent moments – tiny, refracting points of light reflecting faces I almost recognize, scenes half-formed, echoes of laughter and distant bells. The current pulls gently, persistently, not threateningly, but with the undeniable momentum of existence itself. Looking down, I see my own hands, but they ripple slightly, like reflections on disturbed water, sometimes appearing young, sometimes ancient and weathered, all within the span of a heartbeat.

The sky above isn't blue or black; it's a vast, breathing tapestry woven from nebula clouds in shades of deepest violet, emerald green, and searing magenta. Stars aren't distant specks; they are massive, crystalline geodes hanging low, pulsing with soft, internal light and emitting a low, resonant hum that vibrates right through the soles of my feet and up into my chest. It's a sound that feels like belonging and infinite distance, all at once.

Beside the river of time, the banks aren't made of earth. They are composed of tightly packed books, their leather spines worn smooth, their titles written in languages I've never seen but somehow understand instinctively. Opening one reveals not pages, but intricate, moving clockwork mechanisms, each gear and spring releasing faint scents – old paper, dried roses, ozone, rain on hot pavement. The collective ticking isn't monotonous; it's a complex, polyphonic symphony, and the air shimmers with the knowledge contained within.

A creature approaches, walking along the book-bound bank. It's formed entirely of stained glass, lit from within, like a walking cathedral window. Its movements chime, delicate shards of colored light falling onto the 'ground' like musical notes made visible. It doesn't speak with a voice, but communicates through shifting patterns and colours across its surface – deep blues convey melancholy wisdom, bright yellows express sudden joy, swirling oranges show complex thought. It gestures towards the flowing time-river with a limb made of fractured sunset colours, and I feel an overwhelming sense of understanding, a profound truth settling into my core without a single word being uttered.

The *feeling*... oh, the feeling is the hardest part to describe now that I'm trying to grasp it...

**Now, describing it...**

Okay, so I was in this place... but "place" isn't right. It was more like an... *_active state_*. And there was this river, right? But it wasn't water. Imagine touching liquid light, but it felt heavy, like syrup, and warm... and it smelled like... dust motes in sunlight and maybe old photographs? That's completely inadequate. It *flowed*, carrying these tiny flashes, like captured memories you could almost grab. Seeing my hands change age in it... unnerving but also weirdly peaceful.

And the sky! Oh god, the sky. I say "nebula," but that sounds like a science documentary. This was... alive. Breathing colour. The colours were so deep, so saturated, they felt like you could *taste* them – the purple was like deep velvet plums, the green had the sharpness of cut grass and mint. And the stars... they weren't pinpricks. They were enormous, close, like huge glowing crystals, and they *hummed*. Not just a sound you hear with your ears, but a vibration in your bones, like standing next to a giant organ playing one perfect, unending chord. How do you even begin to explain a sound that you *feel* more than hear?

The banks... made of books, yeah, but they weren't just props. You could *feel* the weight of the stories inside them, like pressure in the air. Opening one wasn't reading; it was like looking into the heart of a perfectly crafted machine, and the *smell*... each book had its own unique scent that told its story - musty paper, yes, but also things like salt spray or woodsmoke or metal. It’s impossible; words just make it sound like a quirky library.

And the creature... calling it "stained glass" makes it sound fragile, decorative. It wasn't. It was powerful, ancient. The light *inside* it shifted, communicated... imagine trying to describe a complex philosophical argument conveyed purely through pulses of azure and gold light falling musically around you. It wasn't just sight; it was a full-body comprehension, a feeling of information downloaded directly into my soul. There are no words for that kind of communication!

It's the *intensity* I can't capture. The sheer, overwhelming *reality* of it all. It felt more real, more solid and meaningful than sitting here talking to you now. Trying to describe it feels like showing you a faded, black-and-white polaroid of the most vibrant, living landscape you could ever imagine. The colours, the sounds that were also feelings, the textures that were also ideas... language just crumbles under the weight of it. It leaves me feeling this ache, this huge, vibrant *thing* inside me that I simply cannot share properly. It's absolutely maddening!
