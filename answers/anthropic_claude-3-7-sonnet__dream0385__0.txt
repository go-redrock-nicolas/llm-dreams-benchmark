I am dreaming. I'm standing at the edge of a glass balcony that extends from a cliff face, watching my dearest friend Ellis dance precariously on its railing. The valley below stretches endlessly—a tapestry of emerald forests and silver rivers catching the light of two impossibly large moons hanging in a violet sky. Ellis laughs, arms outstretched, bare feet sliding on the crystalline surface slick with evening dew.

"Come away from there," I plead, my voice echoing strangely, as if traveling through water before reaching my own ears. "The glass is cracking beneath you."

Indeed, delicate fracture lines spread like frost beneath Ellis's feet, but they're visible only from where I stand. Ellis cannot—or will not—see them.

"You're always imagining catastrophes," Ellis says, spinning in a graceful pirouette that sends my heart lurching. "I've never felt more alive! Why won't you join me instead of trying to cage me?"

With each movement, the fractures multiply. I reach out, but my arm stretches impossibly, becoming elastic and useless. The distance between us seems to expand despite neither of us moving.

The air grows heavy with the scent of ozone and wildflowers—beautiful yet foreboding. I notice now that Ellis's shadow doesn't match the human form above it; it spreads like spilled ink across the balcony floor, growing wings and claws that reach toward the edge.

"Please," I whisper, tears floating upward from my eyes like tiny diamonds. "I'm not trying to diminish your joy. I can see something you cannot."

Ellis pauses, looking back at me with eyes that suddenly reflect the twin moons entirely—no pupils, no whites, just celestial orbs. "What if what you see isn't real? What if your fear is the very thing that will shatter this moment?"

I feel the truth of this question resonating in my bones, yet the cracks continue to spread. A paradox of concern and interference unfolds in my mind as time seems to slow.

The glass gives a musical sigh as it begins to give way.
