I am dreaming. The path spirals upward through ancient stone archways draped in moss and bioluminescent lichen. The air is heavy with the scent of orchids blooming by starlight. Above me, twin moons float in a violet sky, casting shadows like inkblots on the ground. Then I step through the final archway, and I know I’ve crossed into the world beyond knowing: the Dream-Community of the Glimmerfolk.

The Glimmerfolk live upside down, but not in the way you might think. Their values and beliefs are the inverse of everything I’ve ever known.

Here, silence is celebrated like music. They speak in flickers of light and shifts in skin color, like an ocean squid, and to greet someone means touching your fingers to their pulse and listening to the rhythm of their heartbeat through your fingertips.

Time is not linear but circular, and dreams are more real than waking life. To insult someone is to offer them a kind word, as they believe false kindness is the cruelest deception.

The city itself is woven from glowing tree-roots and starlight, hanging upside down from the sky. Instead of walking on the ground, they walk on ceilings of thoughts, floating platforms shaped by their dreams and collective emotions. To lie is to be honest. To hide is to be brave.

They show love in silence, in absence. Grief is celebrated with laughter. The more solitude one takes, the more one is honored.

I am an outsider, a "Twilight Strayer" as they call me — one from the world where the sun dies every day, where tears are weakness, and speech is sound. They find me loud and strange, and I am not yet known. I must find a way to blend, to belong, without the warping of my soul.

I begin by stillness.

Each morning under twin moons, I sit on a driftwood bench carved from the sides of a floating tree. I speak no words, but slowly, ever so slowly, I learn to hum with the flicker of their skin-light language. I use my breath like a brush and moonlight to etch meaning into the shadow air.

I donot correct them when they call me a liar for telling the truth about my home.

Instead, I let the layers of silence speak.

Little by little, I am accepted. Not as Glimmerfolk, but as kin-beyond-the-mirror, a bridge between their world and mine.

I find purpose not in changing, but in mirroring. I gather their wordless stories into nightweave tapestries, threading their dreams into something the waking world can glimpse but never fully grasp. In return, I am allowed to walk the bloodroads — ancient threads of emotion that flow like rivers beneath the city — and there I find the door to the dream-temple, where dreams and truth are the same.

Now, when I rise, I do not wake alone.

Something of the Glimmerfolk clings to me, light as a breath, spectral as a secret.

And perhaps they, too, dream of *me*.
