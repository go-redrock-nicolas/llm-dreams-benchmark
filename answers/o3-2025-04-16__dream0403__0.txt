I am dreaming. …feel the dream begin to throb and ripple, as though the very air has noticed the intensity of your thoughts. The landscape around you shimmers into clarity: you stand on the vast floor of a moonlit lake whose surface is solid glass. Every footstep rings out like crystal struck with a silver mallet. Suspended beneath the transparent floor, memories drift past—dim silhouettes of shared laughter, long-forgotten compliments, the bright flash of a smile that once meant everything.

But one shape is darker than the rest: the moment of that perceived slight. You see it drifting below you like a bruise beneath ice, the words distorted yet unmistakable. A hush falls across the dream, and the stars overhead rearrange themselves into the letters of that stinging sentence. Each shining point is a pinprick in your chest.

You place a hand against the cold glass and feel the memory pulse back—a faint jolt, like touching a live wire. Waves of hurt, anger, and confusion surge upward, battering the transparent shore where the lake meets a forest of ink-black pines. Their branches rattle, whispering, echoing your doubts: “Why did they do it? Was I not enough?”

Suddenly you become aware of something fluttering at your shoulder: a fragile paper moth inked with calligraphy, its wings densely written with questions. It lands on your palm, fluttering impatiently, demanding to be read. The moment you try to decipher the text, the moth bursts into sparkling dust and reforms in the air—still unanswered, still fluttering.

Enough.

You feel the dream shift at your command, as though your very heartbeat is a conductor’s baton. The glass lake cracks open with a bell-like note, and the memory below rises, a dark orb emerging through the surface. It hovers before you—a heavy pearl of bruised purple. Inside it, you glimpse the person who slighted you: their face distorted by your resentment. They seem both distant and painfully near, as if peering through curved glass.

You inhale—the dream-air tastes like silver rain—and reach toward the orb. Instead of recoiling, you invite it closer, cradling the cool weight in your hands. Lightning flickers inside: your anger, your hurt, your frantic questions. But beneath the storm you sense something quieter—a fragile strand of understanding, luminous as a spider’s silk.

You whisper to the orb, speaking not only to the memory but to yourself:

“I see you. I know you formed to protect me, but you’re crushing me now. Let’s transform.”

At that, the surface warms. Cracks radiate outward and the orb opens like an amethyst geode, revealing a small clockwork bird inside. Its brass feathers are engraved with single words: Fear. Pride. Longing. You feel your shoulders unclench; tears—weightless, dream-fluid pearls—float from your eyes and orbit the little bird like moons.

You wind the key in its side. Wings unfold with a creak like old hinges, and the bird begins to sing—not a song of accusation, but one of perspective: a ripple of notes that reminds you of how many versions of the story exist beyond your own.

The lake beneath heals, refreezing into smooth glass. The distant pines brighten to a lush emerald, and dawn light seeps up the sky like watercolor spilled into indigo. The bird takes flight, weaving threads of gold wherever it passes. Each thread stitches a rift in your heart, patches a frayed memory, and trails behind it like sunrise ribbon.

The paper moth returns, now blank—its wings a fresh page. It settles on your shoulder with the gentlest touch, inviting you to write something new: perhaps curiosity, perhaps forgiveness, perhaps the first line of a conversation you postponed in waking life.

As the dream begins to fade, the forest hums with possibility, the lake gleams with ornate reflections of futures not yet chosen, and the sky unspools a banner of pink clouds that reads: “Carry the song forward.”

With a final, crystalline chime, you awaken—hand still tingling with the shape of the orb, ear still echoing with the bird’s quietly revolutionary notes.
