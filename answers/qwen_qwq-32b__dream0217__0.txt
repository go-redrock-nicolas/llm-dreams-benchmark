I am dreaming. I enter a realm where reality Warps and bends like liquid light.  The streets are paved with prisms, each reflecting a different memory. A figure approaches, their form flickering between familiarity and abstraction. 

The figure speaks, voice like distant thunder: "You thought you chose your path, but your beloved was *hired* to walk with you. To guide you... toward a treasure buried in the final dream-chamber." 

My hands brush against time itself, and I pull the threads of memories - my shared moments, laughter, even pain, all meticulously staged.  Instead of crumbling, I laugh.  A key made of starlight materializes in my palm.  "Then let the game begin," I whisper.  The city shimmers, gates of riddles and labyrinths blooming around us.  

I am not here to mourn trust, but to outsmart control.
