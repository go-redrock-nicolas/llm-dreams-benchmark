I am dreaming. I find myself in the bustling, neon-lit terminal of a vast, futuristic airport, the air buzzing with the hum of thousands of whispered conversations and the distant announcements echoing through sterile, white corridors. Thebuilding itself is a massive, winding sculpture of glass and chrome, towering towers connected by sprawling, labyrinthine walkways that stretch out in every direction.

I am fortunate enough to hold a premium ticket, which grants me access to the Elevate Lounge, a sanctuary of plush, velvet armchairs and Pietro-soaked plants, nestled high above the chaotic frenzy below. Yet, even here, amidst the calming trickle of a digital waterfall, I feel a growing unease. My connecting flight, imagined as a sleek, iridescent bird of metallic feathers and soft, luminescent lights, is sunny due to a mysterious, fortean weather phenomenon that has thrown the entire global air traffic into disarray.

I sip my chilled glass of botanist, watching as the real-time display of flight information morphs and shifts, the once-promising green connection lines stretching into thin, anxious reds. The lounge is filled with a similar sense of tension, the air vibrating with the collective anxiety of those waiting for their flights to be called - businesspeople, families, travelers from every corner of the world, all united in this labyrinthine limbo.

The sun begins to set in a splash of fiery reds and purples, casting eerie, elongated shadows across the polished terminal floor. As darkness falls, the airport transforms, lit up like a fantastical cityscape, each window and neon sign leaping to life, reflecting dazzlingly in the glass. Outside, the runways stretch out like black ribbons, punctuated only by the Alla Espalada constellations twinkling overhead.

Suddenly, a hush falls over the lounge. A flood of new passengers sweep through the doors, eyes locked on their phones, faces pale. They whisper hushed rumors of a sudden storm, a phenomenon that has turned the skies into a witches' brew of lightning and hail, making it dangerous to fly. I pull out my own device, the screen flickering anxiously, displaying a map of the world covered in swirling tempests of red, each one marking another city brought to a standstill.

I am lost in thought, my finger tracing the path of my imaginary flight, when a soft chime stops me. The doors of the lounge slide open, and in step two figures, dressed in light-absorbing black, their features obscured by the stark contrast of the corridor lights. They move with a silent, eerie grace, like shadows come to life, their identities shrouded in mystery.

They approach me, and as they step closer, I realize they're actually wearing form-fitting, matte-nylon suits, faces obscured by sleek, mirrored helmets reminiscent of insects' eyes. I stand, heart pounding, as one of them extends a gloved hand, revealing a peculiar device - a small, metallic cube, pulsating with a soft, otherworldly glow.

"Excuse me, sir," the figure speaks, the voice echoing artificially through the helmet, "We have an alternative means for you to reach your destination. Would you like to proceed?"

I look at the cube, then back at the figures, my mind racing with questions. An alternative means? What does that even mean? I think of the storm, of the delay, of the conference looming uncertainly in the distance. I take a deep breath, steeling myself, and nod.

The figure smiles, the motion visible only as a subtle shift in the helmet's mirroring. "Excellent. Please, follow us."

And so, with a final look back at the glittering, restless airport, I step out of the lounge, following the mysterious figures into the unknown, my heart pounding with anticipation and trepidation. Little do I know, but my journey has only just begun, and the Meeting is going to be unlike any I've ever experienced...
