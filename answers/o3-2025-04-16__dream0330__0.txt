I am dreaming. You blink and discover you’re already mid-step, alighting from a staircase that folds itself out of thin mist. Each tread flashes briefly with color—saffron, jade, lapis—then vanishes behind you, leaving no retreat. A hush of velvet night hangs overhead, yet the horizon ripples with daylight in the distance, as if the sky hasn’t decided on a time zone. You remember only one thing with certainty: you’re on your way to meet your partner’s family, and every fiber of this place belongs to their world, not yours.

Ahead rises their ancestral home, but “home” feels too small a word. Picture a cathedral sculpted from living cedar and wind-chimes, balanced atop the backs of six colossal water buffalo forged of bronze and tidewater. Lanterns float around the structure like bioluminescent fish, their light beating in sync with your pulse. Somewhere inside, your partner’s relatives are already performing a greeting ritual generations old.

Your partner—who now seems both guide and beloved—takes your hand. Their palm is warm, steady. “Remember,” they whisper, “everything is symbolic.”

The Welcome of the Hundred Paths  
A lacquered gate appears, though moments ago it wasn’t there. On its lintel is a mosaic of mirrored shards. Your reflection fragments into dozens of overlapping versions of yourself: one adjusting a collar, another smoothing hair, another inhaling courage. A golden-robed aunt emerges, her smile ringing like a small bell. She bows—not from the waist but from the shoulders, arms crossing in an X that ends with fingertips touching temples. You mirror her as best you can, uncertain whether to bend deeper or hold longer. Every breath feels amplified, but she brightens, pleased by the respectful effort.

Silk-Paper Names  
Inside the entry hall, a cousin with comet-colored braids offers you a fan of translucent paper slips. “Choose the syllables that feel truest,” they instruct. You recognize some characters as distant cousins of letters you know, others as pure hieroglyphic dream-ink. You pick three. Instantly the slips flutter upward, rearranging into a floating ribbon that spells your name—not the name on your passport, but the one your heart whispers when no one is listening. Applause bursts from invisible corners, and the ribbon dives into your chest like a hummingbird returning home.

The Feast of Reverent Flavors  
Before you stretches a dining platform suspended over a koi pond whose water looks like polished obsidian. Plates hover on magnetic streams, circling slowly so every guest can pluck a morsel when intuition stirs. You taste candied star-fronds that dissolve into memories of childhood summers; a sip of jade broth hums with chords that only your taste buds can hear. Then comes the pivotal bite: a single moon-seed wrapped in scarlet lichen. Tradition requires newcomers to predict its flavor aloud before eating. You feel all eyes—real and imagined—upon you.

“Bittersweet, edged with thunder,” you venture.  
The family nods, satisfied. You place the moon-seed on your tongue. It bursts into a cool rainstorm that trickles from the roof of your mouth to the soles of your feet, leaving you refreshed, standing ankle-deep in sudden puddles that reflect constellations indoors.

Dancing the Spiral Apology  
Your partner warns you of the next rite: the Spiral Apology, an anticipatory excuse offered for any unintentional offense committed henceforth. A circular floor unfurls beneath you, inlaid with constellations of tiny bells. You step lightly, guided by vibrations rather than sight, tracing a slowly tightening spiral. Each chime you trigger translates into melodic phrases—soft sorrows, bright hopes, promises of good will. By the time you reach the center, you feel cleansed, as if every potential misstep has been redeemed in advance.

Tea That Remembers  
An elderly grandfather with eyebrows like sprouting moss pours tea from a pot shaped like a curled dragon. The steam gathers into ephemeral tableaux: your first meeting with your partner, your shared laughter during a rainstorm, a quiet night when fear was named and held gently. The family watches these scenes respectfully—honoring your story without intruding on it. You realize you are being accepted not for perfection but for honesty laid bare in vapor.

An Unexpected Test  
Just when you relax, the ceiling dissolves into sky and a silent snowfall of ivory feathers whirls downward. A teenage nephew grins and hands you a feather tipped in ink. “Write a wish on the air,” he dares. You hesitate—what language does the air speak? You settle on drawing a simple spiral, echo of the apology dance. The mark glows silver, hangs between you and everyone, then drifts upward and pops like a soap bubble. A collective exhale follows. Whatever you wished, it has been heard.

Departure upon the River of Reeds  
Hours or minutes later—you’ve lost count of dream-time—your partner guides you to a narrow skiff woven from reeds that hum faint lullabies. The entire family lines the shore, releasing lanterns shaped like tiny planets. Each lantern contains a word you offered that night: thunder, bittersweet, honesty, spiral. As the skiff pulls away, the lanterns scatter across water that now resembles the night sky, stars above replicated below. You recognize one last ritual: to look back exactly once. You turn, catch every family member bowing in that shoulder-crossed salute, and feel a glowing thread tie chest to chest, heart to heart.

You wake—or at least believe you do—still tasting jade on your tongue, a faint bell chiming in your eardrums, your partner’s warmth encircling your hand like an unbroken promise.
