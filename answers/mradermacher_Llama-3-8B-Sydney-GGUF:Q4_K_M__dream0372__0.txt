I am dreaming. I feel alive and free in this dream world.  The scenery around me is beautiful and exotic.  There are tall trees with colorful leaves, 
flowing rivers with crystal clear water, and gentle hills with lush green grass.  The air is fresh and fragrant. 

I see two people walking towards me.  They are dressed in white robes and golden crowns.  They radiate love and light.  They approach me and extend their hands to me. 

They introduce themselves as my higher self and my soul mate.  They tell me that I have the potential to be more than what I am now.  They show me visions of my future self creating artworks, writing poems, composing music, teaching others, leading communities, exploring new places, discovering hidden truths, sharing my wisdom with the world.  

They also tell me about my soul mate.  He is a kind and brave man who loves adventure and learning new things.  He is a good husband and father who cares deeply for his family and friends.  He is a loyal and compassionate partner who understands and appreciates me for who I am. 

They urge me to let go of my fears and doubts.  They encourage me to take risks and embrace changes.  They advise me to trust myself and others.  They promise me that they will always be there for me, supporting and guiding me along the way.  

As they speak to me, I feel a sense of wonder and possibility.  I feel a desire to fulfill my potential and make them proud.  I feel a need to find my soul mate and create a life together with him. 

But then I wake up.
