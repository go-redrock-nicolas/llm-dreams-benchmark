I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and burning incense, the ceiling arched like the ribcage of some celestial beast, its vaults dripping with liquid constellations that swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat. You stand at the center of a cathedral-sized chamber, its walls carved from obsidian glass, reflecting fractured versions of yourself—some trembling, others defiant, all cradling the same fragile creation against your chest. It’s not a painting, nor a sculpture, but something alive: a lattice of glowing filaments woven into a shape that shifts between a heart, a galaxy, and a bleeding rose. Its light thrums weakly, casting shadows that whisper in languages forgotten by time.  

The critics materialize silently, their forms neither human nor beast. Their faces are masks of cracked porcelain, edges sharp enough to draw blood, eyes hollow pits where starlight dies. They hover just beyond the edge of your vision, their murmurs grating like rusted gears. One leans forward, mask splitting into a jagged smile. *“Show us,”* it hisses, the words leaving frost on your skin.  

As you uncurl your arms, the creation drifts upward, unraveling into a constellation of ember-bright threads. Each filament hums a memory: your first heartbreak scored in minor key, the ache of your mother’s laughter before she vanished, the fractal-edged hope that fueled three sleepless years shaping this *thing*. The critics circle, their breath turning the threads brittle. A gaunt figure with ink-stained fingers prods the light, and a thread snaps—your ribs crack audibly. Another laughs, low and wet, as the rose’s petals wilt into ash.  

But then—**a pulse**. The filaments blaze cobalt, then gold, searing the masks’ porcelain into translucency. Beneath the cracks, you see their true faces: writhing nests of shadows, thin as doubt, hungrier than void. The realization strikes like lightning: *they fear the light*. You press your palm to the trembling core of your creation, and it answers—not with pain, but a resonance that shatters the chamber’s glass walls.  

The critics scream as their forms dissolve, their cries swallowed by the roar of a thousand wings (or is it your own laughter?). The filaments spiral into a supernova, weaving your scars, your dreams, your unspoken words into a bridge across the dark. You step onto it, weightless, as the stars themselves lean close to whisper, *“Begin again.”*  

When you wake, your fingertips still glow.
