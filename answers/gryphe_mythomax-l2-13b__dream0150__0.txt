I am dreaming. The dream starts with me in a world that's eerily similar to ours, but I quickly realize that there are a few differences. This world is more hierarchical and status-driven than ours. Everything from the way people dress, to the way they speak, to the jobs they hold, everything indicates their rank in society.

As someone who doesn't quite understand the ins and outs of this society, I tend to make careless mistakes. One day, I accidentally bump into someone important while walking down the street. They are wearing a purple sash signifying their high status, and I sheepishly apologize, not realizing the severity of the offense.

In this society, touching someone of higher status without their permission is considered a major transgression. I watch in horror as guards surround me, dragging me away to a dingy cell. The walls close in on me, and I wake up in a cold sweat.

The next thing I know, I am standing before a tribunal. They are serious-looking group of people, their faces stern and unreadable. I am wearing a simple white robe, which does nothing to hide my shame.

"How do you explain your actions?" demands one of the judges. 

"I... I don't understand. I didn't mean to offend," I stutter, my voice hardly louder than a whisper. 

The judge's face darkens. "Your lack of understanding does not excuse your actions. You have tarnished the reputation of our great society. What is your recommendation for punishment?"

I look around the room, hoping for someone to intervene on my behalf. But all I see are stern faces, indifferent to my plight. 

"I... I don't know," I mumble. 

The judge stands up and slams his gavel onto the table, sending a chill down my spine. "Then we shall make the decision for you," he says coldly. "You are hereby stripped of all your titles and possessions. You will be banished from this society, never to return."

I feel like I'm falling, my heart racing as the reality of my situation dawns on me. This is it - my life is over. As the guards drag me away, I try to hold back my tears, but they fall anyway. I can't believe I've made such a terrible mistake.
