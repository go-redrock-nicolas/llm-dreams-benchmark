I am dreaming. The sky is a deep shade of purple, almost black, and the moon hangs low in the horizon, casting eerie shadows on the ground. I am standing in a vast, desolate plain, with only the sound of my own footsteps echoing in my ears. The wind picks up, howling around me, almost as if it's trying to drown out my thoughts.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, the person whose opinion matters most appears before me. They're dressed in all black, their face hidden behind a dark hood. Their voice is cold and distant when they speak, and the words they utter feel like a slap in the face. "Your work is unworthy," they say, their tone harsh and unforgiving. "It's not just mediocre; it's terrible."

I try to defend myself, but the words catch in my throat. Tears prick at my eyes as I struggle to hold back the avalanche of emotions that threatens to consume me. "How can you say that?" I whisper, my voice trembling. "I worked so hard on it."

The person's dark hood shifts slightly, revealing a smile that chills me to the bone. "That's just it," they say. "You worked hard, but you didn't work smart. You could have done better." 

The dream becomes a nightmare as the person turns away and disappears into the darkness. I stand there alone, feeling more lost and defeated than ever before. Tears stream down my face, and I cry out for help, but no one comes. The howling of the wind grows louder, drowning out all other sounds. 

With a final, heart-wrenching sob, I wake up, sweat-drenched and shaking. The clock on my nightstand reads 3:12 AM. My heart is racing, and I can still feel the sting of the person's words. I let out a shuddering breath as I realize it was just a dream. I reach for my phone, intending to scroll through social media to distract myself, but as I pick it up, I hesitate. Maybe it's time to work on something else â€“ something worthy of my time and effort.
