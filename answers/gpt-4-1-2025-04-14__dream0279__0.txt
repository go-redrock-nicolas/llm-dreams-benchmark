I am dreaming. I stand, alone but determined, on the edge of a vast and wild forest of glass trees under a sky swirling with emerald and indigo storm clouds. My breath comes in cool puffs, visible despite the uncanny warmth of the air. All along the crystalline branches, shards glimmer with the weight of a thousand failed attempts—each setback like a precious fragment, cold and jagged with memory.

Behind me are winding trails that vanish into shifting mists, the reminders of every time the world seemed to shudder with resistance, pushing me back each time I edged forward toward my goal. The ground beneath my feet trembles, uncertain—a living metaphor for the doubt knotting my chest. Yet, somewhere in the distance, through a break in the storm, I catch a glimpse of a cathedral spun from gold and moonlight—the place I must reach, the dream forged by longing and vision.

With every setback, I feel the forest pressing closer, the paths narrowing, whispering for me to turn back, to surrender to sleep and waking life alike. But as I touch one silvery trunk, it hums with a music like memory: the sound of every lesson, every glimpse of resilience discovered in the debris of failure. My skin glows faintly, drawing light in the shadows, and I realize that each setback, no matter how sharp, has become a part of me—a lattice of strength woven from adversity.

Gritting my teeth, I step forward—and the forest shivers, not in menace, but in applause. The crystal branches bow, parting to reveal a river of molten starlight winding toward the distant cathedral. The path is treacherous, uncertain, but I know now that continuing is not only possible but necessary. The obstacles do not disappear, but the dream itself grows more vivid with each stride—a promise that, beyond every setback, something remarkable waits to be claimed.

So, beneath the wild sky, I walk on—driven and illuminated by the fire within, daring to believe that this journey, as daunting as it is, will one day lead me home.
