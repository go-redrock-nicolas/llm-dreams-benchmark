I am dreaming. I find myself standing in the shadowed wings of a grand, opulent theater, the kind that reeks of history with its gilded balconies and crimson velvet curtains. The air is thick with anticipation, a palpable hum of excitement vibrating through the unseen audience beyond the heavy drape. My heart thunders in my chest, a wild drumbeat of panic and exhilaration, as I clutch a tattered script in my trembling hands. I’m dressed in an elaborate costume—a swirling, emerald-green robe embroidered with golden threads that shimmer like captured starlight, paired with a heavy, jeweled crown that presses down on my brow as if to remind me of the weight of this moment. I don’t know how I got here, but the urgent whisper of a stage manager in my ear tells me I’ve been called to replace a virtuoso performer, a legend whose name I can’t even recall in this surreal haze.

The role? A tragic, Shakespearean monarch, a character woven from poetry and pain, whose every line must drip with gravitas and whose every gesture must command the stage. I’ve never acted, never even spoken a soliloquy aloud, yet here I am, expected to embody this towering figure with skills I’ve never honed. My mind reels with fragmented memories of high school plays I never auditioned for, lines I’ve never memorized, and a voice that has never projected beyond a casual conversation. But there’s no time for doubt—the curtains are trembling, ready to rise, and the murmur of the crowd crescendos into an impatient roar.

I peek through a slit in the curtain and see them: a sea of faces, indistinct yet piercing, their eyes glinting like polished obsidian in the dim house lights. They’re waiting for me, expecting brilliance, a performance that will sear itself into their souls. My stomach churns, a storm of butterflies and dread, but something stirs within me—a strange, dreamlike confidence, as if the theater itself is whispering encouragement through its ancient wooden beams. The script in my hands glows faintly, the words shimmering as though alive, rearranging themselves into patterns I somehow understand, even if I’ve never read them before.

The stage manager gives me a sharp nudge, his voice a hurried hiss: “You’re on!” The curtain begins to ascend with a slow, deliberate creak, revealing the vast, empty stage bathed in a golden spotlight. It’s a desolate kingdom, a set adorned with jagged, obsidian towers and a throne that looms like a skeletal relic of power. I step forward, my boots echoing on the polished wood, each step reverberating through the silent hall like a heartbeat amplified. The audience falls into a hush so profound I can hear the faint rustle of their programas and the distant drip of wax from the chandeliers above.

I open my mouth, unsure of what will emerge, and a voice that isn’t entirely mine spills forth—a rich, resonant baritone that carries the weight of a thousand sorrows. “To be, or not to be,” I begin, though I know these aren’t the right lines for this play. Yet the words twist and morph midair, becoming something else, a lament of a king betrayed, a cry for a kingdom lost to shadow. The audience leans forward, entranced, their breaths held as if my words are weaving a spell around them. I move, unguided, my arms sweeping in arcs I’ve never practiced, my body bending under the imagined weight of a crown far heavier than the one I wear.

The stage transforms around me mid-performance. The obsidian towers crumble into ash, replaced by a stormy moor where lightning splits the sky with jagged, electric veins. Rain—dream-rain, cold and biting—pelts my face, though I know it’s not real, and my voice rises over the tempest, a defiant roar against fate. I am no longer just me; I am the monarch, the storm, the very essence of tragedy. The audience weeps—I can feel their tears like a tide washing over me, their gasps like gusts of wind fueling my performance.

But then, a misstep. A line falters on my tongue, a word I don’t know, and the illusion flickers. The storm pauses mid-crack of thunder, the audience’s faces sharpen into masks of judgment, and I feel the weight of my inexperience crushing down. I’m an impostor, a fraud on this sacred stage. My hands shake as I grasp for the next line, desperation clawing at my throat. Yet, in this dream, failure isn’t final. The script in my mind glows brighter, the words surging back to me like a lifeline, and I speak again, my voice steadier, bolstered by some unseen force. The storm resumes, the audience’s faith restores, and I am once more the king, unbroken even in defeat.

The final act approaches, a crescendo of anguish and Catharsis. I fall to my knees before the ghostly throne, delivering a monologue of loss so raw that my own tears mingle with the dream-rain. The audience rises, a wave of shadowed silhouettes, their applause a thunder louder than the storm I conjured. The curtain falls with a heavy sigh, and I’m left alone on the stage, panting, exhilarated, transformed. I don’t know if I was truly brilliant or if the dream merely painted me so, but in this moment, I feel the pulse of performance, the magic of a role I never knew I could play.

As the theater fades into misty oblivion, I awaken with the echo of applause still ringing in my ears, my heart racing as if I’ve truly stood before a thousand eyes. The dream leaves me with a lingering question: was that me, or was I merely the vessel for something greater, something the stage itself dreamed into being?
