I am dreaming. The night suddenly shifts into an unfamiliar morning as I open my eyes to an altered world. Outside, the muted colors of the buildings have shifted into a vivid, pulsating collage of hues, as though someone has splashed watercolors across the facade of reality.

As I step outside, the crisp air carries whispers of change and an undercurrent of confusion. Only now do I notice the absence of bustling streets and the sounds of passing vehicles. Everything seems unnaturally still and quiet.

 How odd, I think as I glance around—there are people roaming the streets, but none seem to be doing what one would expect: going to work, shopping, socializing. They drift aimlessly, as if lost in their thoughts.  

Suddenly, I witness an imposing figure dressed in regal robes approaching a woman who innocently hums an old melody. Her song fills the air with a captivating warmth before it's abruptly pierced by the sounds of gasps and fear. The figure strikes her down with unfathomable cruelty.

I hurry into what was once a quaint coffee shop, only to find it transformed into an eerie, dimly-lit sanctuary. Instead of the aroma of coffee and baked goods, an unfamiliar scent lingers in the air—a mix of metal, sage, and something more unsettling.

Ahead, a group of people huddle in confusion, whispering about the change that has swept through their lives. Their tales echo with stories of unexpected encounters with armed individuals imposing decrees, declaring the simplest and most endearing aspects of life illegal: a shared smile, a tender embrace, a moment of genuine laughter.

As I spend more time in this world, I comprehend how the ordinary fabric of society has not only shifted but has been entirely unraveled. I find myself in a place where people fear to express themselves freely, hiding behind manufactured masks of complacency. Every shadow seems to whisper a forgotten truth, and every echo of silence carries the weight of an oppressive, unseen authority.

This dream of a world shaped by fear and restriction leaves me with a chilling feeling of unease, as I try to find my way back to the familiar reality that once was my life.
