I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a vast, shifting plain of glassy obsidian, reflecting a sky stitched with threads of molten gold and indigo. Each step you take sends ripples through the ground, as if the earth itself is liquid, trembling beneath your weight. You are searching for something—or someone—but your mind is a fog of half-remembered faces and fractured voices. A hollow ache pulses in your chest, a void that grows with every breath.  

Ahead, a bridge of translucent crystal arches into a storm of black feathers and flickering stars. It is crumbling. Each shard that breaks away dissolves into smoke, and the gap between where you stand and the other side widens, second by second. You run, but your legs move as though wading through honey. Behind you, shadows coalesce into figures—friends, strangers, lovers from lifetimes ago. Their eyes are hollow, their mouths sewn shut with silver thread. You scream for help, but your voice is swallowed by the wind, which howls in a language you almost understand.  

One figure steps forward, familiar yet unrecognizable, their skin peeling like bark from a birch tree. They hold out their hands, palms upturned, revealing writhing roots that burrow into the ground, anchoring them in place. You beg them to move, to *pull you forward*, but they only tilt their head, their expression a mosaic of pity and resignation. The roots tighten, pulling them downward until they sink into the obsidian, leaving only their eyes floating in the dark, watching.  

You turn back to the bridge. Now it is a thread of spider silk, quivering in the storm. Below, the abyss churns—a sea of ink, dotted with the flickering lights of drowned stars. You cling to the silk, your fingers raw, your nails peeling back as you inch forward. The voices behind you grow louder, but they speak in riddles, their words dissolving like ash on your tongue. A child’s laughter rings out, sharp and bright, and when you glance back, the plain is gone. Instead, you float in a cathedral of bones, its vaulted ceilings formed from ribcages, its stained glass windows made of blood and moonlight.  

The figures are here now, suspended in the air, their stitched mouths split into silent grins. You scream until your throat bleeds, but they only drift closer, their hollow eyes reflecting your face—a stranger, gaunt and luminous, dissolving at the edges like smoke.  

Then, a hand brushes yours. Warm. Real. A pulse of light fractures the darkness, and for a heartbeat, the bridge solidifies beneath your feet. The child’s laughter returns, softer now, and the cathedral of bones becomes a garden of fireflies. But when you turn to grasp the hand, it is gone. Only a feather remains, falling endlessly into the void.  

You wake gasping, your sheets soaked in sweat, the taste of ash still on your tongue. The dream clings to you like a second skin, its terror and beauty fused to your bones. For days, you’ll wonder: Was the hand real? Or just another trick of the mind, weaving hope from the threads of your own unraveling?
