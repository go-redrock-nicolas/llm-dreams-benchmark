I am dreaming. I slip deeper into the dream, feeling the warm, honeyed darkness of a great pavilion unfolding around me—its silken tapestries alive with shifting patterns of ancestral faces. At the center of this hall stands a long, scarred wooden table. On one side sit two siblings, their eyes like storm-tossed seas; on the other, their mother, her hands clenched as though she’s still holding a shard of some terrible memory. I take my place between them, a calm heart afloat on churning waters.  
  
As I open my mouth to speak, the tapestries rip open and become living murals: scenes of argument passed down through generations, each ancestor’s sorrow echoing like distant thunder. The siblings’ voices rise, harsh and brittle: old debts, old betrayals—they throw names as if hurling stones. Their mother’s tears flash like quicksilver. The tension ripples through the air so thick I can almost taste it, metallic on my tongue.  
  
I let the storm peak. The floorboards tremble beneath our feet and the ceiling begins to drip molten light. Then I breathe, drawing that molten glow into myself, letting it cool into a gentle luminescence at my chest. My voice, when it comes, is low and warm, as though I’ve bottled the hush just before dawn: “Tell me what you carry. Not the anger you hurl, but the hurt behind it.”  
  
Silence falls so suddenly it feels like diving beneath a lake’s surface. The siblings stare at me, startled. The mother blinks back tears. One by one, they unburden themselves: a promise broken years ago, a stifled sorrow over a lost childhood home, the weight of unspoken love turned to resentment. I catch each confession in my cupped hands and blow them back into the room as soft, shimmering motes. They drift upward and stick to the tapestries, spill across the walls, until the entire pavilion glows with the family’s true story.  
  
Then I call forth a secret stored at the heart of the table: a faded letter sealed in amber wax. As I break it open, the wax cracks with a sound like falling rain. The letter’s ink glows with a pale, otherworldly light, and the voice of a great-grandmother—long gone—rises from the paper, weaving a gentle plea for forgiveness and unity. Her words are a balm: “Love is the inheritance no legacy can take away.”  
  
The angry shapes on the tapestries begin to soften. The walls breathe in relief. The mother leans forward, reading the letter by its own lantern-light until her shoulders sag, and she lets out a single, shuddering sigh. The siblings’ eyes meet, and for a moment, you can taste the release of all that grief. They reach across the scarred wood and touch hands.  
  
The pavilion dissolves into a grove of ancient oaks whose roots tangle and then untangle themselves into the silhouette of the old family home—no longer fractured, but whole, living wood that breathes. The three of them step inside, the wounds in the boards sealing as they pass. Sunlight filters through leafy windows, golden and forgiving.  
  
I stand at the threshold and watch them rebuild—lamp by lamp, floorboard by floorboard—until the place hums with warmth and laughter. Then I turn and walk back into the shadows of the oak grove. Somewhere behind me a door closes with a quiet click, and I wake, the echo of that forgiving light still glowing beneath my ribs.
