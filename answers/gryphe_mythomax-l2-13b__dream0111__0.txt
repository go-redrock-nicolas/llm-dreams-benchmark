I am dreaming. I am a world-renowned surgeon, highly skilled and trained in the art of brain surgery. Today, however, I find myself in an unusual scenario: Performing brain surgery on a patient with a time limit of just 10 minutes. The clock is ticking, and my hands are trembling. I cannot afford to make a single mistake. 

The operating room is stark white, almost blinding. Lights shine harshly down on the patient's exposed brain, revealing a network of veins and arteries as if they were intricate map of a labyrinth. I take a deep breath, steadying myself as I gaze in awe at the fragile organ before me. 

I make the first incision, steadying my hands as I feel the scalpel pierce through the skin. There's a momentary resistance, but then the blade slices through like butter. Blood oozes out, staining the surrounding area crimson red. 

As I delve deeper into the patient's skull, the smell of burning flesh fills the air. The edges of my vision begin to blur, but I force myself to focus on the task at hand. This is life or death, and I cannot afford to fail. 

With precision and care, I begin to remove the damaged part of the brain, taking great care not to slice into any of the delicate blood vessels. Each movement is calculated, each incision measured down to the smallest detail. 

Suddenly, the alarm sounds. Ten minutes have already passed, and the patient's life hangs in the balance. I can't believe it: We've made it this far without incident. But there's still so much more to do. 

I work feverishly now, my movements hastened by the ticking clock. The patient's vital signs begin to stabilize, and for a moment, I allow myself a glimmer of hope. Maybe we'll make it after all. 

And then, in a blinding flash, the dream ends. I awaken with a start, my hands trembling and drenched in sweat. It's just a dream, I tell myself. But the image of that brain, lit up by the operating room lights, remains burned into my memory.
