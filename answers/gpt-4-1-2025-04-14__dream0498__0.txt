I am dreaming. …drift, not through a world, but through a storm of feelings and moments. I am both observer and participant in a realm where time is made of ripples and eddies, unruly and personal.

I find myself suspended over a boundless, prismatic sea. Each wave is a memory or a possibility. The surface shimmers with scattered scenes: childhood laughter bouncing on a sun-warmed field, the urgent hush before a lover’s first kiss, the heavy silence of waiting rooms. I reach for a swell that glows with activity—a bustling marketplace—my senses ignited. My engagement is absolute. Time slams its brakes: seconds stretch to hours as colors intensify, voices layer, every grain of the experience magnified. 

Suddenly I lose interest, and the scene dulls, colors fading to grays. Now, I float detached—moments slip through my fingers like quicksilver. With nothing to anchor me, time rushes forward: weeks unravel in a blink, seasons wheel overhead, flowers bloom and wither on fast-forward. 

Curiosity stirs. I dive into a book pulled from the foam—a story within the story. Each word draws me deeper. Pages turn, but here, minutes are molasses, thick and tantalizing. The world outside my focus evaporates, and I become wide-eyed, childlike, inside the narrative’s heart.

But distractions flicker at the edge of my vision—a parade of clocks, their hands spinning at senseless speeds. One clock ticks so slowly that, if I try to watch, its minute hand never moves. Another spins backward, and I laugh—a strange, echoing sound—as I remember forgotten jokes and lost opportunities suddenly anew.

Time rebuilds itself as a labyrinth, each corridor branching depending on desire. When I chase a melody drifting through the dreamscape, the seconds expand into a symphony, sensations drawn out until each note seems infinite. When I try to escape boredom, the corridors collapse, and I slip through trapdoors into days and years that blur and blend until they mean nothing at all.

At the center of this shifting maze, I understand: time here is not a ruler, but a mirror. It stretches or shrinks, deepens or dashes on, only reflecting the pulse of my attention—how fully I let myself be submerged in now.

I awaken—for a moment—marveling at how the dream lingers, vast and slow, long after the night has passed.
