I am dreaming. You're dreaming. The fluorescent lights in your office flicker with an unsettling hum, like a swarm of mechanical insects poised to devour you. Each time they buzz, your heart hammers a little faster, as though the sound alone is fueling the suffocating pressure that has clung to you for weeks. Rows of desks appear to stretch toward an impossible horizon, each piled with towering stacks of paperwork that threaten to topple at any moment. They sway like skyscrapers in a windstorm, and you have the absurd thought that if you blink too hard, the entire office might come crashing down around you.

At first, the walls seem bland, corporate gray—yet, after a moment, they shimmer and ripple, taking on a texture like molten ash. You step forward, finding that the floor, tiled with glossy promotional posters, tugs at your feet as if it doesn’t want to let you go. The posters are plastered with slogans—“Give 200% for half the pay!” and “Your job is your life!” in bold red script. Their cheery tones and forced grins clash violently with your churning anxiety.

A manager with a perfectly polished smile glides past, dissolving into a thin haze of lavender fog before your eyes. In that purple mist, voices echo about sales goals, deadlines, performance metrics… They tumble over one another in escalating waves. No matter where you turn, a new face looms in your path, each one a mirror of your own exhaustion. They mouth silent instructions you can’t hear, but you feel the force of their demands pressing in on you like invisible hands gripping your shoulders. You can’t tell if you’re trembling from fear or sheer frustration.

Your heart craves escape, but your pockets feel heavy, stuffed with coins that weigh you down. You realize each coin is embossed with the words “Financial Security,” and the letters glow with a dull luminescence, as though mocking your predicament. You try to cast them aside, but they stubbornly cling to your fingers, multiplying each time you attempt to drop them. The coin piles grow and grow, shimmering with a strangely ominous allure—a reminder of the money you need, the reason you can’t simply walk away from this unending labyrinth.

A corridor beckons, lined on both sides by giant analog clocks, their hands spinning in erratic circles, each ticking agonizingly louder than the last. You know you need to move; the longer you linger, the more the intangible stress sears your mind. Driven by the prickling feeling that your time is running out, you force yourself forward through the hallway. The wallpaper beneath the clocks pulses with your heartbeat. Suite doors branch off at odd angles, some suspended halfway up the walls, others upside down. Each door promises a different kind of intensity: deadlines in one, performance interrogations in another, gossip that gnaws at your self-worth in the next.

At the corridor’s end stands a heavy red door, glowing with an internal light. You push it open to find a cramped meeting room, filled with silhouettes around a giant oval table. Their faces are blurred and shifting, morphing into shapes that resemble anxious clouds, flickering screens, or swirling storms. They drone on, pointing to a set of slides that float above the table. You can’t make out the details, but you know they involve unattainable targets and impossible demands. A lump grows in your throat as the silhouettes turn to stare at you, their eyes burning with neon intensity. A wave of guilt and dread washes over you—these are expectations you cannot realistically fulfill. Yet something compels you to nod and accept it all.

Suddenly, one of the swirling silhouettes extends a bony hand, offering you a pen. It’s heavier than it should be, engraved with “Sign Away Your Sanity” in curling silver script. The silhouetted figure points to a glowing contract etched into the tabletop. Lines of corporate jargon float like spectral text, rearranging themselves every time you try to read them. Panic twists in your chest—you can’t decipher the clauses, but you sense they’ll trap you further in this never-ending cycle of demands. Yet your own hand, beyond your control, reaches out to sign.

Before pen meets contract, the overhead lights explode, sending glass shards raining onto the table and scattering the ghostly figures. You’re left alone, bathed in the pale glow of emergency backup lights. The door behind you slams shut, sealed by invisible forces. Silence encloses you like a tomb, and for a moment, you teeter on the edge of despair.

But something stirs inside you—a spark of self-preservation, a whisper of hope that challenges the gloom. The dream begins to warp and crack. Faint ribbons of dawn light bleed through the edges of the room, dissolving walls, papers, demands, and illusions. You feel the weight in your pockets lessen as the coins fall away, evaporating into strands of vapor. In the first streaks of morning’s glow, you sense a quiet certainty that you do not have to surrender—neither to the haunting clutches of that toxic workplace nor to its impossible expectations.

With one final breath, you break free from the dream, heart pounding. You awaken to daylight, mind still reeling from the labyrinthine halls and shapeless demands, but with a faint sensation of empowerment, knowing that you still have a choice.
