I am dreaming. I know I'm dreaming yet I also feel restless.  My fingers brush against a paintbrush, and suddenly the air buzzes with possibilities.  The canvas before me isn’t just white—it’s alive, pulsating with a soft, iridescent glow, like the membrane of a jellyfish.  I don’t need paints; my brush stokes the canvas, and where it comes into contact, colors spiral and burst into existence.  Violet tendrils curl into nebulae, gold droplets form swirling galaxies.  With every stroke, I can feel time.  It’s like touching the surface of a river—fluid, malleable.  I paint an hourglass, and the sands within it rush upward and spiral downward simultaneously. A tree I sketch bears fruit that ripens and decays in seconds, its leaves turning crimson and skeletal before sprouting again.  I realize I can fold the canvas—layers of moments and memories collide.  A childhood sunset merges with a future sunrise, a grandmother’s laugh echoes as I brush her portrait, and I fix a moment I’ve long regretted.  Yet, in the reflection of my canvas, I see my own face aging and then returning to youth with every flick of the brush.  The boundaries of “now” become liquid.  I pause.  There’s a pull, a whisper of someone watching from the periphery of the dream.  A humanoid figure made of starlight and ink blots waves, and invites me into a gallery of infinite walls where each painting pulses with its own timeline.  I accept, stepping through my canvas and into a realm where I can sculpt epochs like clay and erase or reimagine tomorrow with a single cerulean streak.
