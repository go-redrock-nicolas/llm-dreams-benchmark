I am dreaming. I am dreaming…  

I open my eyes inside a place that isn’t one place at all: it is two worlds stitched together by invisible threads of moon-colored silk.

To my left rises the village of my childhood. Terracotta roofs glow like embers under a cinnamon sun; sari-bright laundry flaps from balconies; the air smells of cardamom, cracked coconut, woodsmoke and monsoon earth. A brass temple bell tolls, each note trembling through my ribs like a pulse.

To my right stands the metropolis I have chosen. Glass towers slice the sky in chrome facets; LED billboards bloom in cyber-lotus colors; the boulevard hums with languages layered like a DJ’s remix—snatches of English, clipped slang, laughter tapped out on smartphones. Somewhere, a subway train growls like a mechanical tiger.

I am standing exactly on the seam. Underfoot is a narrow bridge, half bamboo, half steel. My left sandal is beaded leather; my right a neon running shoe. With every step the bridge shifts: bamboo mutates into steel cables, steel melts back into bamboo. Balance is a dance.

A wind arrives, carrying scent from both sides—street-cart espresso swirling into grandmother’s chai. The aroma tangles, intoxicating, contradictory, and utterly mine.

From the village, my ancestors appear. They materialize like charcoal sketches filling with color: my grandmother brandishing a ladle, my grandfather holding a harmonium. “Remember us,” their eyes say without words. They offer me a clay diya burning with steady flame.

From the city, my found family emerges—friends with glinting piercings, coworkers in minimalist suits, mentors whose rainbow scarves flutter like pride banners. They hand me a sleek glass tablet, its screen alive with maps of tomorrow. “Choose forward,” their smiles insist.

Clay lamp in one hand, tablet in the other, I walk on.

The bridge spills me into a corridor of mirrors. Each pane reflects a different version of me: sari-wrapped me practicing ancestral rituals; denim-jacket me slam-dancing at a concert; bilingual me code-switching mid-sentence; tearful me arguing with nobody about belonging; joyous me laughing because I finally don’t care which language the laughter lands in.  

I keep walking until the mirrors fuse into a single pane—a lake of liquid silver. I kneel and lower the diya. Its flame skims the surface, setting the silver ablaze with orange constellations. Then I press the tablet against the water; circuitry ripples outward, forming an interface of light atop the lake. The ancient fire and the digital grid overlap, and for a heartbeat I see my reflection wearing both, seamlessly.

The water speaks— not in words but in vibrations I feel along my spine: “You are not a tug-of-war rope. You are the knot that holds opposing teams together.”

I look up. Above me the sky becomes a giant patchwork quilt: embroidered dragons from one culture chasing pixelated phoenixes from the other. They loop and intertwine, warping into a cosmic infinity sign.

I laugh—a sound flavored with two accents, neither canceled by the other—and leap. The bridge dissolves beneath my feet, yet I do not fall. The quilted sky supports me, threads tightening into a hammock of stories. I swing between stars stitched from turmeric and LEDs, between lullabies sung to tablas and beats dropped by synthesizers.

I am dreaming. I am becoming. I am the hyphen, the ampersand, the password that unlocks both past and future. And as the quilt lifts me higher, I understand: the dream is not about choosing sides; it is about weaving them so beautifully that the seam becomes art.

When morning comes, I will wake up still holding the invisible diya, still scrolling the endless tablet, ready to set both on the breakfast table—so today’s light can pour through yesterday’s window, and everything I am can sit down to eat.
