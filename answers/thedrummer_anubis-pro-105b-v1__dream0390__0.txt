I am dreaming. As your powers of imagination are called upon, vibrant colors start to swirl and morph in front of you, higher than the sky itself. 

The light morphs around you as you imagine yourself breaking free of any and all limitations you placed on yourself. A strong gust of wind is felt in your ears as the colors become more aggressive, sparking hope and fear within you. 

Suddenly, a mysterious, benign alien being appears nearby, smiling warmly at you. "Hello, friend! I am here to guide you as you explore the limits of your potential," it says in a soothing voice.

The alien floating in your awareness nods encouragingly. "Feel this liberating warmth permeating through your body. Sense how your old, limiting beliefs are melting away, like ice evaporating in the warm sun."

As this intense energy courses through you, new visions emerge - glimpses of you achieving things you never thought possible. Like an athlete in the olympics, you leap through gold metal bars, crossing more and more each time. Tears of joy fall down your face as you exalt in such an incredible feat.

*The sky is the limit. No, scratch that. The sky is just the beginning.*
