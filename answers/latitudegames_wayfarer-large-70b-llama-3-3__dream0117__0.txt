I am dreaming. You stand frozen in the bustling city square, surrounded by the steady hum of everyday life. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, its rays glinting off the glass-and-steel skyscrapers that loom overhead. Your mind races with the crushing knowledge - a catastrophic event will strike in precisely one hour, bringing unmitigated destruction in its wake. The very thought sends waves of icy dread coursing through your veins, yet you force yourself to remain outwardly calm, your features set in a mask of composed desperation.

You notice a young mother laughing as she pushes her stroller, oblivious to the impending doom. An elderly man reads his newspaper on a bench nearby, completely unaware of the fate that awaits. Couples stroll hand-in-hand, absorbed in their own personal worlds. The chaotic vibrancy of the city, teeming with life and movement, clashes sharply with the desolate void of your inner turmoil.

As you scan the faces of passersby, a string of incomprehensible mumblings escapes your lips. Your frantic gaze darts between your watch and the surrounding masses as precious minutes slip away like grains of sand in an hourglass. Time marches on, each tick a deafening countdown to oblivion. Hours merge into an eternity as silent screams build in your throat.

The air thickens. Nature responds to the coming catastrophe, despite the ignorance of humanity. Ominous clouds gather in the sky as birds flee en masse. An unnatural chill caresses the back of your neck. Yet still, no one heeds the warnings written across the heavens.

With thirty minutes remaining, you find your voice. Your words emerge firm yet controlled, a desperate cry in the cacophony of urban life. You grab a megaphone from a nearby street vendor and relay your message one final time. But the gathering crowd dismisses you as just another city kook, their laughter and jeers cutting through your warning.

Twenty minutes. Then ten. Five. Every tick of the clock feels like eternity as you watch the unseeing masses go about their lives. The city square remains a whirlwind of normalcy - lovers kissing, children playing, life carrying on. You stand amidst it all, the prophet of doom cast aside, powerless to alter the course of fate.

And then, nothing. The world freezes in a moment of crystal clarity - the last second of peace before the storm. You brace yourself, your last conscious act before the world as you know it comes to an end in a catastrophic explosion of sound and fury. Your dream world implodes in a flash of blinding white.
