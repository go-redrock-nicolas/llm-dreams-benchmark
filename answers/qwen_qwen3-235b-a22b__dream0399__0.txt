I am dreaming. And in this dream, the entire universe feels alive in a way that defies waking logic—an intoxicating collision of color, sound, and emotion, all pulsing in rhythm with my heart. The air shimmers like hot glass, yet it’s cool and breathable, filled with whispers of forgotten lullabies. Each breath enters my lungs like silk, wrapping me in ancient warmth, as if the atmosphere itself is sentient and nurturing.

I stand on an endless plain stitched together by starlight and memory—a vast horizon where locations fold into one another like pages of an open book. Behind me is the crumbling city block where my father used to drink alone, the return of his shadowy silhouette now haunting the edge of perception. To my left, the school hallway materializes—lockers lined with silent echoes of laughter and teenage cruelty, the place where I first learned the sting of labeling someone as "other". Ahead of me is a jungle of shifting time, a place where people I once judged without truly listening now live in vignettes—fragments of pain and beauty woven into this surreal dreamscape. 

As I walk forward, I feel that my capacity for empathy has expanded, transcending the fragile, bitter armor I once wore. My skin feels porous now, vibrating with the stories of others. Emotions rush in like waves—unfiltered, tender, and inescapable—but there is no fear. Instead, there's clarity. My heart has become a mirror, reflecting all shades of humanity with porous acceptance. 

I see the face of my old boss, once the canvas of my frustration and resentment as he barked orders in meetings with an iron fist. In the dream, I step closer to him, and suddenly I don’t just see him—I feel him. Inside his chest is an ache I didn’t know: the leftover scars from a childhood spent craving control in a world that spun chaotically. I feel the fear that made him unbearably rigid, the phantom of a small boy who grew up needing to be perfect just to feel safe. The sharp edges soften, and I understand.

To the left, there’s someone I haven’t thought of in years—an ex-friend turned bitter rival. They stand in the dream with their head bowed, cloaked in shadows, but when I reach out to them, the shadows fall away. They unveil their face, and in it I see a flood of emotion—their jealousy, their loneliness, their fear of being forgotten. For the first time, I recognize the shared fragility beneath the divide. I wrap my arms around them, but words aren’t necessary—we dissolve into wordless understanding, and the pain lifts like a veil.

With each moment of connection, the landscape changes. The crumbling city repairs itself, cobblestones rearranging into intricate patterns underfoot. The school hallway is no longer cold but glowing warm amber and filling with soft music, as bullies turn into boys and girls trying to belong, broken and brave. Each person I once dismissed or condemned explains themselves—not through words, but through vivid impressions. A mother avoiding eye contact in a grocery store wasn’t judgmental, she was drowning in secrets. The man who snapped at my cashier joke was numbed by silent grief. The girl who mocked me used cruelty as a shield against insecurity—it wasn’t personal. None of it was personal.

I become a living tapestry of shared humanity. My chest swells with the resonance of their stories, each one braided into my own. The immense compassion that fills me isn't exhausting—it's expansive, like the open sky after a storm. The colors of this dream deepen, exploding in brilliance as if the love I’m feeling spills into the air around me, painting the environment gold and emerald and ultraviolet.

Eventually, I see my younger self—a small figure frozen midstep on this psychic plain, angry and confused, clutching judgments as protection. I kneel beside them—beaming, all-seeing now—and whisper, *“It's okay. You don’t have to guard yourself anymore. Let me carry you.”*

They cry, and I hold them.

When I wake from this dream, I won’t remember the exact shape of the sky or the jungle of shifting time or how the stars danced above. But something within me will remain transformed—an openness, a new willingness to listen, to forgive both others and myself. Because in this dream, I didn’t just expand my awareness—I became the glowing core of empathy itself, and that light still glimmers behind my closed eyes.
