I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

A violet twilight sky drapes itself over an impossibly tall amphitheater carved from milky quartz. Every step of the amphitheater’s staircases glows faintly, as though moon-dust has seeped into the stone. Somewhere below, an orchestra you cannot see plays notes shaped like silver feathers; each trill flutters upward and brushes your cheeks with a cool, weightless touch. The hushed crowd around you—part people, part living silhouettes—waits without breathing. They have come to witness judgment, and you, inexplicably, are both the judge and the judged.

In the center of the arena stands a transparent cage grown from crystalized rainwater. Trapped inside is a phoenix whose plumage combusts in slow motion: tangerine flames freeze and droplet into golden cinders, fall, and then blaze back up the wings again, looping endlessly. Its black, sorrowful eyes hold galaxies of regret. You know without being told that the phoenix’s heartbeat is bound to the surrounding valley. If it remains imprisoned, the valley’s rivers will clot with salt and the orchards will wither. Yet releasing it violates the Covenant of Celestial Containment—a law older than memory, etched across the amphitheater’s arches in runes that ripple like living mercury. That Covenant has protected the dream-kingdom from chaos for eons; break it, and the sky might split, raining mirror shards upon innocents. Keep it, and everything will desiccate in slow agony. 

High on the rim of the arena, a tribunal of robed constellations leans forward, starlight pulsing in their throats. In unison, they present the Lawgiver’s Staff: a rod of obsidian threaded with veins of blue fire. They command you to touch it, to seal the cage, to let the phoenix’s light die quietly in a tomb of rules. Meanwhile, down in the sand, a barefoot child—her eyes luminous with the green of spring buds—slips through the guards and places her palm against the crystal bars. The phoenix shudders under her gentle touch, and the child looks up at you as though you are the final page of every bedtime story ever told.

A hot wind swirls, tasting of burnt sugar and marigold. From somewhere deeper in the dream, a voice that might be your own whispers: “Mercy has a higher jurisdiction than any covenant.” Another voice, colder, insists: “Without order, mercy becomes meaningless.”

You stand at the cusp of two staircases:

1. The left staircase rises toward the tribunal. Each ascending step is laser-sharp, inscribed with the word OBEY, and every time your foot lifts, the letters rearrange themselves into the faces of those you would save by keeping tradition intact—blurred, numerous, expectant.

2. The right staircase descends into a garden of luminous night-blooming lotuses that exude a perfume of salted caramel and thunderstorm ozone. This path leads to a lever grown into the roots of an ancient willow. Pull it, and the cage will dissolve, setting the phoenix free—but tremors have already crept along the arena walls, hinting at the chaos that could follow.

You feel gravity shifting between your shoulder blades, as though unseen wings are forming—from duty or from compassion, you cannot tell. Your heartbeat synchronizes with the phoenix’s, each thrum a question mark. The tribunal pounds the Staff once, twice, thrice. The unseen orchestra hushes. Even the flames freeze.

In this ethical dilemma, you inhale, tasting stardust and sand, and—
