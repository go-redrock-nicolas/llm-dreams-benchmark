I am dreaming. The dream starts off with me standing in a familiar place, but it's as if everything is distorted and warped. The room I am in looks like it's been twisted by some kind of intense force. Everything seems to be moving slightly, like it's alive. 

As I look around, I notice there are other people in the room with me. They appear to be friends and family members, but they don't recognize me at first. They continue to go about their daily lives, oblivious to my presence. 

I try to interact with them, but they just ignore me. It's as if they can't see or hear me. This feels eerily familiar, like deja vu. 

I decide to explore further, hoping to find an exit or perhaps someone who can help me understand what's going on. As I walk through the distorted rooms, I notice that things keep changing around me. One minute I'm in my childhood home, the next I'm in a place I've never seen before. 

Every interpretation of this bizarre situation feels both familiar and unsettling. Each time I think I have figured something out, the dream shifts again, leaving me questioning my understanding of reality. 

Eventually, I stumble upon a large, open space that resembles a cityscape. The buildings are twisted and warped like the rest of my surroundings. As I make my way through this chaos, I spot a person who looks capable of helping me. I run towards them, hoping they can tell me how to wake up from this nightmare. 

But when I reach out to them, they disappear, leaving me alone once again. I feel a sense of despair wash over me as I realize that I am trapped in this dream, unable to escape its confusing and disorienting reality. 

The dream ends with me standing in the middle of the empty city, unable to comprehend what's happening or why. All I know is that I am lost within the ambiguity of my subconscious mind.
