I am dreaming. Wait, am I?  Hmm... myself still, focusing on the sensation of the ground beneath my feet.  It’s soft and warm, like walking on a beach at sunset.  The air smells  by the seaside, with briny waves and the faintest hint of coconut from someone’s far-off umbrella.  But something isn’t right.  I can feel a pull, like a gravitational force tugging me toward the horizon where the sun dips below the waves.  Every step I take in the opposite direction feels lighter, almost effortless.  Yet every step toward that golden-pink allure feels heavier, each footfall sinking deeper into the sand as if I’m wading through molasses.

My heart races, not out of fear, but because there’s a curiosity and a strange familiarity in this pull.  I’ve felt this before—this magnetism toward what I know will hurt me.  Like the time I stayed up all night scrolling through someone’s cntacted messages knowing it would only leave me hollow.  Or the nights I ate candy until my stomach ached, wearing it wouldn’t happen again.  Each step toward the horizon is a echo of those choices—voluntary, yet somehow assaulted by my ownchoices because I  from my own choices. because I’m drawn back, time & again, to scenarios that  not dissolve in name but in feeling..

The horizon blurs, the sky bleeding into a child possession.  Suddenly, I’m no longer on the . beach. I’m in a .
I’m in a cavern lit by bioluminescent fungi, their soft violet glow casting long, quivering shadows on the walls.  The air here is frigid, and the is slippery with moss that emits a faint, medicinal .  There’s a path .. briefly here—wait, no, caves don’t have paths.  But there it is: a trail oflucent, glowing mushrooms leading deeper into the cave, pulsating in rhythm with my pulse.  I follow them, my breath visible in the biting cold. step is deliberate, yet my hands tremble as if something down this. I can’t explain why, but I feel certain that finding whatever lies at the end of this vein will bring relief—or perhaps the!  Most_KIND of pain.  Maybe both?

The mushrooms grow denser, their light more intense, until the cave opens into a circular chamber arched with crystals that cast rainbows on the ceiling.  In the center stands a  of obsidian, its surface carved with fractals that seem to move when I blink.  Its eyes are hollow, but when I step closer, two points of fierce white light flicker to life within them, locking onto me like a tractor beam.  “You came,” the statue speaks, its voice a chorus of whispers from every direction at once.  “You always do.”

A wave of recognition washes over me.  It’s not the first time I’ve stood before this monument.  I see flashes of other lives, other caves, other versions of myself approaching this same figure, each time enticed by the promise of answers—or maybe just the relief of understanding why we chase what we know will contribute to our own unhappiness.

“You  (understand), don’t you?” the statue asks.  “The pain is not the end. It’s the only compass we’ve got when we’re lost.”

I feel a  form.  The statue inclines its head, a  curving its stone lips.  “To break the cycle, you must first stop seeing the  cravings as enemies,” it says.  “They are, in their twisted way, calling for you to love yourself enough to listen—really listen—to what they need before they become screaming storms.”

The chamber begins to shake.  The fungus light flickers, then fades.  “Return now,” the statue whispers.  “But when the pull comes again, bring this with you: the courage not to fight it, but to simply…”  The last word is by the sudden silence.

I jolt awake, the lingering chill of the   cavern in my bones.  My room is shrouded in night, but in my palm rests a single  glowing faintly violet.  feels , both a warning and a kindly nudge toward self-compassion in the face of my own   suffering.  journey continues, but now I wonder: what if the road to healing isn’t about running from the pull, but walking toward it with open hands?
