I am dreaming. I find myself standing on a silver dais in the center of a colossal, glass-walled amphitheater, surrounded by a crowd whose collective breath hums like an electric current through the air. High above, floating spotlights of glimmering cerulean cast fractal patterns across the floor, causing my reflection to dance and shift like a mirage.

I feel a tingle of anticipation coiling around my spine. My name echoes through the amphitheater, amplified by invisible speakers, followed by loud applause that reverberates in my bones. Around me, the other candidates stand poised—renowned experts with polished resumes, faces keen and resolute. Each looks the part: decades of training, masters of advanced techniques I cannot even name. They wear futuristic bodysuits made of shimmering fibers that thrum with intelligence, scanning and synchronizing with their every move.

My own attire, by contrast, looks like a patchwork uniform hurriedly assembled from mismatched fabrics: ribbons of gold, scraps of midnight-black, a single, brilliant red feather perched at my collar. I clutch two slender rods in my hands—tools for a skill I’ve never practiced. The rods burn with an otherworldly light, whispering in a language I can’t decipher.

A steady, crystalline voice declares, “Welcome to the Grand Sphere of Oracles. Today, you will each attempt the most difficult conjuration in existence. Should you succeed, you will guide our civilization into a long-prophesied era of endless prosperity. Should you fail, the dream itself may fracture.”

The crowd’s energy intensifies, swirling into a prismatic maelstrom of color above our heads. Spectators stand on balconies built along the amphitheater walls, each level more ornate than the last: golden vines twisting into arches, crystalline railings studded with luminescent seeds that flicker like stardust. The hush that falls over them becomes a tangible presence, pressing gently against my ears until I can only hear my own breathing.

My gut roils with self-doubt. I’ve never studied the ancient arts. I’ve never honed my inner vision or learned how to wield intangible forces. Yet here I am, singled out. A thrill courses through my veins—fear and wonder entwined—because somehow, in this vivid dream, I believe I might just have a chance.

Taking my place in a spiral mosaic at the center of the dais, I raise the rods. Their glow intensifies, sending beams of light into the mosaic’s swirling pattern. The ground pulses beneath my feet, each crest of energy aligning with the pounding of my heart. The mosaic ripples, and an opalescent mist emerges, swirling in lazy circles around me.

Lights dim across the amphitheater. The only illumination is the shimmering aura curling from the rods. Some intangible sense tells me to focus on the mist—on its undulating shapes that form and dissolve like ocean waves. As my eyes sharpen their gaze, I feel the rods growing hot, instructing me to move them in smooth arcs.

Slowly, I trace runic symbols in the air, fumbling with each stroke. The rods respond in kind, leaving arcs of shimmering stardust that erupt into miniature galaxies before disintegrating into the mist. My breath comes in short gasps, but somehow I manage to continue, forging shapes I barely grasp, following an instinct older than logic.

Gasps and murmurs from the crowd signal something is happening. The swirling galaxies I create grow brighter, coalescing into a single point of blazing brilliance. The brilliance intensifies, forming a towering vortex that ascends into the heavens. Within that vortex, echoes of doors appear—each door carved from a different gleaming gemstone, each radiating its own melody in an intricate cosmic chorus. One is emerald, humming softly like a lullaby. Another is sapphire, singing with high-pitched clarity. Yet another is ruby, pulsing with a deep and rhythmic cadence.

Suddenly, my heart seizes in my chest as the sapphire door bursts open. A torrent of dancing lights—spirits of possibility, or knowledge from realms unknown—spirals out of it, scattering like fireflies across the audience. The amphitheater awakens in a celebration of color, the crowd’s astonished cheers finger-painting the air with excitement. I feel the rods pulse with approval, even as they slip from my trembling hands.

The ground beneath me quivers, and for a moment, I think the dream might be collapsing. But instead, the mosaic expands, revealing that I stand at the threshold of countless worlds. The invisible voice returns, resonating in an almost intimate whisper meant only for me: “This is the path rarely tread by those who can already harness the power. But you, who arrived with doubt and an untrained spirit, have opened more doors than any Oracle before.”

A hush falls again, and the other candidates stare. I can see both awe and envy flicker across faces once full of serene confidence. They seem uncertain, weighed by disbelief at what just transpired. Overhead, new constellations flicker into view, as though capturing the moment in the very sky.

My heart, once racing with doubt, now swells with an indescribable mixture of relief and exhilaration. Perhaps I never needed their specialized knowledge. Perhaps this calling was always meant for someone unburdened by preconceptions of what could or could not be done.

Even as the dream swirls around me, shaping itself into the next impossible scenario, I feel a rush of gratitude. In this ethereal amphitheater, I’ve discovered a wellspring of magic and wonder that defies explanation, and in doing so, proven that sometimes untrained belief can carve a more wondrous path than practiced expertise.
