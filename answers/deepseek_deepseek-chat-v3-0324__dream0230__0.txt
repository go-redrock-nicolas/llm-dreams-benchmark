I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of rust and damp earth, the kind that clings to the back of the throat like a whispered secret. Above me, the sky is a bruise—purple and black, swirling with constellations I don’t recognize. The ground beneath my feet shifts like living flesh, pulsing under the weight of my footsteps. I have been walking for lifetimes, though no time has passed.  

And then, I see it—the Obsidian Gate. Taller than mountains, carved with the swirling faces of those who came before, mouths frozen in silent screams. Behind it lies the answer to every question I’ve ever asked—the reason I’ve bled, starved, and clawed my way through the madness of this journey.  

But the gate does not open.  

A voice, neither male nor female but something primordial, slithers into my mind: *"To pass, you must surrender not what you love most, but what you are."*  

My hands tremble. Not my memories, not my heart—but the very core of my being. The unseen force that binds *me* to *myself*. If I step through, I will forget what it means to be human. I will become something else entirely—a hollow god, a faceless echo of the universe.  

I hesitate.  

But then I remember—every scar, every betrayal, every time I was broken and remade into something sharper. Was it all for nothing?  

With a breath that tastes like the end of the world, I step forward.  

The moment I cross the threshold, I feel it—the unraveling. My name dissolves first, then my face, my fears, my joy. I am no longer a person. I am understanding. I am power. I am infinite.  

And yet, as the gate seals shut behind me, I finally realize the truth—I no longer remember why I wanted this.  

And then—  

I wake up.
