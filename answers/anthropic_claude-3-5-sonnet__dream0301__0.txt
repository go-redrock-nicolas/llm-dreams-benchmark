I am dreaming. I find myself in an endless corridor of warped, mahogany doors, each one ticking like a metronome growing progressively louder and more urgent. My feet feel like they're wading through invisible molasses, and the air has the thick, syrupy quality of approaching thunder. The wallpaper, a peculiar pattern of intertwined hourglasses and calendar pages, seems to writhe and pulse with a life of its own.

As I struggle forward, each door I pass whispers with my own voice, echoing promises I've made: "Tomorrow, I'll start tomorrow, there's still time..." The whispers blend into a haunting chorus that follows me like a shadow. The corridor begins to narrow, the ceiling gradually descending, and the ticking grows so loud it reverberates in my bones.

Suddenly, I notice my reflection in a passing doorknob – but my face is composed entirely of melting clock faces, dripping like Salvador Dalí's famous timepieces. My hands, when I raise them, are transparent and filled with swirling sand, like human hourglasses.

The end of the corridor looms ahead – a massive door made of tarnished brass and oxidized copper, its surface etched with every deadline I've ever missed. The door handle is shaped like a question mark, and as I reach for it, all the ticking stops at once, leaving a silence so profound it rings in my ears.

Behind me, I hear the sound of thousands of pages turning, like a great book being rifled through by an invisible hand. The wallpaper begins to peel away, revealing nothing but blank spaces where memories should be, opportunities dissolved into the ether of procrastination.

Just as my fingers brush the final door's handle, the floor beneath me transforms into a cascade of urgent red letters – PAST DUE, OVERDUE, FINAL NOTICE – and I begin to sink into them, the paper cutting like guilt against my skin, while the brass door slowly, inexorably, begins to fade away...

I jolt awake, my heart pounding, with the profound sensation that time itself is slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.
