I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city that breathes—a labyrinth of glass towers that shimmer like frozen lightning, their surfaces alive with shifting murals of faces you’ve worn: the polite smile, the furrowed brow, the hollow laugh. The streets pulse beneath your feet, cobblestones morphing into mirrors that reflect not your image, but fragments of your unspoken thoughts—a diary written in smoke. You walk, or perhaps float, through this place, your shadow stretching and curling like a question mark.  

In the distance, a crowd gathers. They wear masks of porcelain, each one flawless, each one identical: serene, unblinking, *acceptable*. You join them, and instinctively, your own face smooths into the mask you know by heart—the one you crafted for boardrooms, for parties, for the grocery store line where you nodded at strangers while your mind screamed silent symphonies of loneliness. The crowd chants in unison, their voices a velvet hum: *“Be seen, be seen, be seen.”* But when you open your mouth to speak, no sound emerges. Your throat is a locked vault.  

Then the dream fractures.  

You stumble into an alley where the air tastes metallic, like swallowed pennies. Here, the walls are made of teeth—rows and rows of them, chattering in a hundred languages, whispering every lie you’ve ever told yourself: *“They’ll hate you if they know. You’re too much. You’re not enough.”* At the alley’s end, a door floats in midair, its handle a serpent coiled around a key. You grasp it, and the serpent bites your palm. Pain blooms, sharp and sweet, and the door swings open to reveal…  

Your childhood bedroom. But it’s wrong. The walls are papered with Polaroids of every version of you: the joker, the martyr, the overachiever, the ghost. In the corner, a child sits cross-legged, scribbling furiously in a notebook. You recognize her. She’s you, before the world taught you to fold yourself into origami birds to fit inside cages. She looks up, her eyes twin eclipses—black holes that see *everything*.  

“You left me,” she says, her voice the sound of a thousand crumpling stars. “You buried me under all that noise.”  

You try to speak, to apologize, but your mask cracks down the middle. It peels away like wet paper, revealing the raw thing beneath—a face you don’t recognize, all jagged edges and glowing marrow, a creature made of storm clouds and wildflowers. The child smiles, and the room dissolves.  

Now you’re standing on a cliff where the sky bleeds into the ocean. Below, waves carve the shape of hands, reaching upward. You leap, and as you fall, your body unravels into a flock of starlings, each bird carrying a secret you’ve never voiced. They scatter across the horizon, shrieking with the joy of being unbound.  

The dream ends as you wake in your bed, gasping. Your cheeks are wet. For once, you don’t wipe the tears away. They feel like proof.
