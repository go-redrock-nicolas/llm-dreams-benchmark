I am dreaming. I find myself floating in mid-air, surrounded by colorful clouds and playful rainbows.  My body is weightless,
my mind is free.   I feel happy, curious, and full of possibilities.

I see two people approaching me from opposite directions: a man and a woman. They are both dressed in white robes and carry
symbols of peace and unity: doves, olive branches, and hearts. 

The man represents logic and rationality. He speaks in clear concise sentences:
"Hello there! My name is John. I'm here to help you create your perfect dream by asking me some questions about myself and what I stand for."

The woman represents emotion and intuition. She speaks in lyrical poetic phrases:
"Welcome to my world of dreams where anything can happen and everything makes sense. My name is Jane. I'm here to help you
create your perfect dream by asking me some questions about myself and what I stand for."
