I am dreaming. The wildfire is raging all around me, the flames like a pack of ravenous beasts nipping at my heels, threatening to devour me whole. The smoke thickens by the second and I can feel the oppressive heat closing in on me like a heavy blanket.

I first try to run, but the fire chases me, wild and untamed. My lungs burn with each breath, desperately gasping for fresh air. The choking smoke gets denser by the second, obscuring my vision, blurring the lines between reality and illusion.

Just when the situation seems dire, a gust of wind appears out of nowhere. A mighty eagle, previously camouflaged by the smoke, comes gliding in, it's piercing eyes surveying the scene. It swoops down and grabs my shoulders with its powerful talons, hoisting me into the sky.

We hover above the raging inferno, looking down at the living nightmare below. The wind fuels the fire, causing the flames to dance and sway like tormented souls. Even though I am safely away from it all, a small part of me feels the urge to dive back down into the chaos, into the wild flames, just to experience the thrill of it all.

But the eagle doesn't let me. It carries me higher into the sky, leaving the chaos below. As I rise higher, the air gets cooler and the smoke dissipates, leaving behind nothing but a vast expanse of blue sky and gentle clouds. The atmosphere is serene.

A sudden sense of peace washes over me. I look down one last time at the fire below, now but a mere speck in the vast expanse of the world. The eagle releases me, letting me free fall for a moment, only to catch me again with its strong talons. We soar through the sky, free and unburdened, leaving behind the fire and chaos of the world below.

As we ascend even higher, the distant stars get closer. Suddenly, we're not just flying over the Earth but through the universe itself. Planets, galaxies, and nebulae pass by, each of them a marvel to witness. The eagle carries me on a grand tour of the cosmos, each sight more breathtaking than the last.

Yet, unlike the others, one star doesn't twinkle. Instead, it grows brighter, larger. As we get closer, I can see a world of vibrant colors on the star's surface, with landscapes and creatures of unimaginable beauty. I can feel the joy of the dream, so exhilarating that I wish to stay forever. With each moment, I grow happier, my heart swelling with an overwhelming sense of love for this dream universe.

The dream culminates in a cosmic symphony, a blend of colors, lights, and sounds. It's so intense that it takes my breath away, carrying me back to reality. I wake up with a sense of awe and gratitude, feeling as though I have experienced a once in a lifetime adventure that few can imagine.
