I am dreaming. **The air is thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic, like the aftermath of a storm.** The walls of the command center hum with an eerie, pulsating light—bioluminescent veins running through blackened steel. My reflection in the polished floor is distorted, flickering between clarity and something… *other*.  

I don’t belong here.  

The task force surrounds me—**geniuses, warriors, minds honed to razor precision.** Their gazes are knives. A woman with irises like liquid mercury studies me, unblinking. A man with neural implants crackling along his temples exhales smoke from a cigarette that isn’t burning. They don’t speak. They don’t have to.  

**"You’re the one they sent?"** The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere, synthesized, mocking. The mission brief materializes in the air—glowing symbols in a language I somehow understand. **A breach in reality. A city folding in on itself. Screams from places that don’t exist.**  

I open my mouth—**no sound comes out.** Instead, my hands move on their own, adjusting controls I’ve never seen, inputting codes that sear themselves into my vision. The team stiffens. The woman’s silver eyes widen.  

**"That’s impossible,"** someone whispers.  

The floor lurches. The walls dissolve. We’re no longer in a room—we’re standing on the spine of a colossal, slumbering machine, its gears the size of skyscrapers, grinding in the abyss. The city below us is **a fractal wound, buildings twisting into impossible shapes, streets swallowing their own tails.**  

And then—**I realize I know this place.**  

I’ve seen it in the edges of sleep, in the static between thoughts. The team looks to me now, not with doubt, but with something worse: **recognition.**  

**"You’ve been here before,"** the smoking man says, not a question.  

The dream shudders. The machine beneath us awakens.  

And I understand—**this isn’t my first mission.**  

**It’s my last.**
