I am dreaming. You find yourself standing in a forest where the trees are made of glass, their crystalline branches chiming softly in the wind like wind chimes forged by the stars. The ground beneath your bare feet is a mosaic of mirrored tiles, reflecting not your face, but fragments of memories you’ve buried: a childhood goodbye, a heartbreak you never spoke of, a fear of being too much or not enough. Above, the sky pulses with auroras that shift hues with every breath you take—indigo for sorrow, rose-gold for longing, emerald for the secrets you’ve swallowed whole.  

You walk, hesitant at first, until you stumble upon a clearing where a river flows backward, its current thick with liquid light. Kneeling, you cup your hands to drink, but the water slips through your fingers like smoke. A voice hums from the roots of the glass trees: *“To drink here, you must offer something first.”* Your throat tightens. You think of the poem you never shared, the apology you never gave, the way your voice cracks when you say “I love you” to someone who feels like home. You open your mouth and let out a sound—a raw, trembling note that shatters the silence. A tear falls. It doesn’t sink into the river but *transforms* it, turning the smoke into honeyed light that swirls into a cupped lotus of gold. You drink, and the taste is like forgiveness.  

Suddenly, figures emerge from the trees—faces you know, strangers, ghosts of people you’ve lost. They circle you, their eyes glowing with the same aurora hues. One by one, they begin to speak. A friend confesses she’s been lonely for years, her voice trembling like a moth’s wings. A stranger admits he’s afraid of the dark, though he’s never told anyone. Even the ghost of your grandmother, her hands always steady in life, trembles as she whispers, *“I missed you when I was gone.”* With each confession, the air shimmers. Vines of luminescent ivy spiral from the ground, weaving around wrists, ankles, hearts—binding you all together like threads in a tapestry. The glass trees bloom with flowers that sing in harmonies that make your bones ache.  

You realize the vulnerability isn’t a wound here. It’s a *language*. Every fragile word, every trembling admission, is a seed that sprouts into something alive. The mirrored ground now reflects not your faces, but your shared truths—your collective, radiant brokenness. When you finally speak your own truth aloud—*“I am afraid, I am afraid, I am afraid”*—it doesn’t unravel you. It becomes a bridge. The vines tighten, not to choke, but to hold.  

The dream shifts. You’re floating now, suspended in a sky made of liquid mercury, the people around you tethered by threads of light. The fear you carried feels lighter, diffused, as though shared gravity has turned it into a constellation. Below, the glass forest bends but does not break, its branches ringing louder now, a symphony of resilience.  

You wake with the taste of honeyed light still on your tongue, the echo of singing flowers in your ribs. The dream lingers, not as a fantasy, but as a map: a reminder that vulnerability is not the crack in the vase, but the gold that fills it, the alchemy of turning weakness into a bridge, again and again and again.
