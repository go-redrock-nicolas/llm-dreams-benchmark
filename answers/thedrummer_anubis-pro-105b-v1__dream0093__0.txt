I am dreaming. I'm dreaming! The dream has begun.

You are dreaming. The knowledge stream comes crashing down upon you like a tidal wave, threatening to overwhelm your very being. Juxtaposed against this, you're opening your eyes to new vistas of enlightenment, hungrily absorbing the multiple disciplines of esoteric lore and rarefied intellect. Used to the challenges posed by microorganisms and cellular biology, you now seek to merge converging fields conjointly - from acoustics to linguistics to topology. But will the forebrain budments endure against the nightly solipsistic shocks of the novelty or merely retrench with an interfering patina of monosyllabic sounds? Alas, as tightly showing some abuse... they might satisfy rules most known but alright now.
