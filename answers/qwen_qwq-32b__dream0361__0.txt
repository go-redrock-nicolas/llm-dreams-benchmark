I am dreaming. The air hums with a melody only I can hear, a tune that coils around my senses like moonlight threading through water. My feet lift effortlessly, each step sending ripples of stardust spiraling behind me. Ahead, an archway of twisting willow branches stretches into an inky sky, their leaves shimmering like crushed emeralds. But as I approach, voices—soft yet urgent—begin to whisper from the shadows. *Turn back,* they murmur. *This path is for the foolish, the reckless.* 

The archway’s scent intoxicates me: petrichor and jasmine, with a hint of burnt copper. My pulse quickens. Beyond the gateway lies a labyrinth of crystalline trees, their trunks pulsing with veins of liquid light. I know instinctively that touching one will unravel secrets older than time. The whispers grow harsh, hissing of madness and ruin. But the pull within me—the need to disregard logic and follow the song in my bones—is a wildfire I cannot quench.

Describe what happens next as I touch the tree.
