I am dreaming. # The Whispers of the Sand People

I open my eyes to find myself beneath a vast canopy of stars, more brilliant and numerous than I've ever seen. The cool night air carries scents of unfamiliar spices and smoke from dying fires. I'm lying on an intricately woven mat outside a circular tent made of deep burgundy fabric that ripples gently in the desert breeze.

As dawn breaks, I discover I've somehow been taken in by the Nahadri—a nomadic people who move like shadows across the golden dunes. Their skin is burnished copper, etched with indigo markings that tell stories of their ancestors. They speak in melodic tones, their language a complex arrangement of clicks, whispers, and drawn syllables that seems to mimic the desert winds.

The tribal matriarch, Elder Sefina—a woman whose face maps a hundred journeys across the sands—has declared that I am "moon-sent," a rare omen. This status spares my life but guarantees nothing more. To truly belong, I must pass through the Seven Veilings—ancient rites that test both body and spirit.

My first challenge arrives with the morning sun. I must learn to walk across the scorching dunes without leaving footprints—a seemingly impossible task. A young tribesman named Khal demonstrates a peculiar sideways step that barely disturbs the sand. For days, my feet blister and burn until finally, I master the whisper-walk, my feet caressing rather than impressing upon the desert floor.

The second veiling requires me to find water where there appears to be none. Elder Sefina blindfolds me and leads me into the emptiness. Left alone, panic rises until I quiet my mind and notice the subtle fragrance of moisture. Following this invisible thread, I discover a hidden spring nestled between rocks that appear barren to the untrained eye.

During the third ritual, I learn their sacred songs—haunting melodies that conjure mist from the dry air at dawn. My throat cracks and bleeds as I practice the unusual vibrations, but the first time I successfully pull droplets of water from seemingly empty air, the tribe's children gather around me with eyes wide in acceptance.

As I progress through each veiling, my body transforms—my skin darkening under the relentless sun, my movements becoming fluid and economical. I learn to read the stars as maps and to hear messages in the shifting of sand dunes.

The final veiling demands that I journey alone into the heart of a sandstorm to retrieve a crystalline stone that glows with inner light. Terror grips me as the wall of sand approaches, but I enter it willingly, guided by newfound instincts...

The dream shifts, and suddenly I am dancing around a massive fire, my body painted with the sacred indigo markings of family lineage—marks that Elder Sefina herself has placed upon my skin. I have become Nahadri, a child of the dunes, keeper of ancient ways that modern minds have forgotten.

And somehow, in this dream, I understand that I have always belonged here among the whispers of the sand people.
