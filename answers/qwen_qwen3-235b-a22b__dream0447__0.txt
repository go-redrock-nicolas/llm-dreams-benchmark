I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, golden frequency, as if the atmosphere itself is breathing. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all, but towering spires of obsidian glass, their surfaces etched with veins of liquid light that pulse in time with your heartbeat. The ground beneath your bare feet is soft, spongy—a moss that glows faintly violet when you step on it, then fades to ash-gray as you lift your foot. You notice immediately how your breath deepens here, how your chest feels both heavier and lighter, as though the gravity of the air is massaging your lungs into a rhythm older than memory.  

You walk forward, and the temperature drops. Not abruptly, but like a slow closing of a fist. The warmth that had clung to your skin like syrup peels away, replaced by a chill that seeps into your bones—not unpleasant, but electric, sharpening your senses. The light shifts too: the sun, now a blood-orange smear behind a veil of indigo mist, casts shadows that move independently of their objects. A shadow fox darts past you, its form flickering between solid and silhouette, trailing sparks of static that make the hairs on your arms rise. You feel a surge of exhilaration, a primal alertness, as though your cells are remembering a language spoken only in dreams.  

Then the wind changes.  

It arrives as a low, resonant chord—a sound felt more than heard—that vibrates in your molars. The mist thickens, and suddenly the air tastes metallic, like copper coins and ozone. The moss underfoot blackens and hardens into a labyrinth of crystalline thorns, each shard reflecting fractured versions of yourself: a child laughing, a stranger weeping, a version of you with eyes like smoldering coals. The mood here is claustrophobic, the energy oppressive, as if the very molecules are conspiring to slow your thoughts. You feel doubt gnawing at the edges of your mind, a heaviness in your limbs. But then you notice the thorns: though sharp, they’re hollow, humming with a trapped wind. You pluck one, and it shatters into a hundred tiny flutes that scatter into the air, each playing a single note of a forgotten melody. The weight lifts. The mist clears.  

Ahead, the forest opens into a clearing where the ground ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting a sky now streaked with auroras—even though it is noon. The auroras pulse in time with your thoughts: when you focus on joy, the colors blaze emerald and indigo; when anxiety flickers, they dim to a stormy gray. Here, the air smells of burnt honey and static, and you feel a strange duality—both untethered and deeply rooted, as though you’re a conduit between realms. You realize the environment is not just affecting your mood; it’s *collaborating* with it, amplifying, distorting, and healing in turns.  

You kneel, pressing your palms to the mercury-earth, and it ripples outward in concentric circles, each wave carrying a memory: your grandmother’s hands kneading dough, the first time you tasted saltwater, a forgotten lullaby. The energy here is cyclical, nourishing—like drinking moonlight. You feel your boundaries dissolving, your identity spilling into the dream like ink into water. And yet, there’s no fear. Only awe.  

Then, a shift. The auroras snap shut like a curtain, and the clearing dissolves into a desert of floating sand dunes, each grain glowing faintly phosphorescent. The wind here is hot and dry, carrying whispers in a language of sighs and clicks. Instantly, your energy sharpens into focus—a laser-like clarity—as if the desert is stripping away all superfluous thought. You run, and the sand parts before you, revealing veins of molten gold beneath, rivers of light that sing in harmonic scales. You laugh, and the sound echoes a thousand times, each iteration a different timbre, a different emotion: grief, triumph, longing, peace.  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue, knowing this: the world is always speaking. You just forgot how to listen.
