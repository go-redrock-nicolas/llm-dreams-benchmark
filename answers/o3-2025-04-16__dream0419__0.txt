I am dreaming. …find yourself standing in a vast, echo-chamber cathedral made entirely of mother-of-pearl. Pillars shimmer like moonlight captured in solid form; every breath you take scatters milky rainbows across the walls. Somewhere high above, unseen choirs applaud—not with hands, but with sudden bursts of starlight that flare and vanish.  

Their praise washes over you in waves—“Brilliant,” “Radiant,” “Worthy”—each word a bell-tone that reverberates through your ribs. Yet instead of lifting you, the compliments make your shoulders curl inward, as though the notes carry a strange, invisible gravity. The floor softens to nacreous quicksand; each approving echo pulls you ankle-deep, thigh-deep, until you feel you might disappear beneath a glimmering tide of gratitude you can’t quite accept.

You press a palm to one pillar for balance. The mother-of-pearl warms, then ripples like liquid glass and opens a doorway the size of a heartbeat. On the threshold waits a figure robed in indigo twilight—neither entirely stranger nor entirely you—wearing a mask of mirrored silver. Where the eyes should be, shifting scenes play: moments from your waking life when praise fluttered toward you like butterflies only to be swatted away, politely, awkwardly, almost desperately.  

The guide extends a hand. “Walk,” they say, voice a gentle hush of midnight tide. “But carry the applause with you, instead of letting it carry you.” Curious, you step through.

The cathedral falls away, replaced by an open sky smeared with watercolor dawn. You tread a path of floating glass stepping-stones—each stone labeled with words you once heard about yourself: Creative. Loyal. Insightful. On the first stone, the letters glow too brightly; you flinch. The stone shivers, threatening to crack. You pause, inhale the cool dawn-air scented with dew and distant citrus. “Yes,” you whisper, acknowledging the praise without argument. The glare softens; the stone steadies.

Stone by stone, you test this new ritual: see the word, feel the pinch of resistance coil in your stomach, speak a small, clear “Yes.” With each affirmation, the letters dim from blinding neon to gentle ember, becoming readable, believable. By the time you reach the stone labeled Exceptional, the knot inside you loosens of its own accord. You say “Maybe,” a tender compromise. The stone accepts that too, glowing warm gold.

Ahead, the final stepping-stone bears no inscription. The guide reappears beside you, mask dissolving into silver dust. They share your face, your freckles, your quiet uncertainties. “This one,” they murmur, “is for the praise you have yet to meet. Name it yourself.”

You think of qualities still blooming in secret chambers of your soul and say, “Growing.” The word etches itself onto the blank glass in lively green script. The stone glows, not with applause but with possibility, and feels as solid as earth beneath your feet.

The dawn-sky brightens to midday, the glass path transforms into a living bridge of vines and wildflowers, and the distant applause fades into birdsong—no longer crushing, merely present, like wind in the leaves. You exhale, realizing the discomfort never meant you were unworthy; it only signaled the tender places still adjusting to light.  

Somewhere far below, the mother-of-pearl cathedral dissolves into seafoam. You turn your face toward the sun, waking, quietly resolved to meet the next compliment not with reflexive recoil, but with a gentle nod, a measured “Yes,” and the steadying memory of glass stones beneath your dream-bare feet.
