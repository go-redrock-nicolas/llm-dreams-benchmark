I am dreaming. you decide to create an ideal companion for yourself, one who is friendly and fun-loving. You visualize your creation in your mind's eye, giving it a name and personality as you go along. 
You find the process of creating life through imagination deeply satisfying.

Your companion emerges from your dreamscape. It looks exactly like you imagined it! It has a cute smile and bright eyes. It says hello to you. 
It seems happy to be alive.
