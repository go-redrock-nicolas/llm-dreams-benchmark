I am dreaming. I am in control of my dreams.  

I see colors and shapes floating around me.  I hear sounds and melodies coming from nowhere.  I feel sensations and emotions coursing through me.  

I know that I can change anything in this dream world by simply thinking about it.  I decide to create a new species of animals called Dreamimals.  

These creatures are made up of different elements such as water, fire, earth, wind, light, sound, color, shape, and more. They can fly, swim, run, crawl, explode, dissolve, transform, and do many other things that defy logic and physics.  

I imagine a large group of Dreamimals gathered around me in a circle.  Some are floating in midair while others are swimming underwater or crawling on the ground.  There are also some who are made up entirely out of sounds or colors or shapes or ideas or feelings or memories or fantasies or illusions or dreams...  

I feel happy and curious as I watch them interact with each other through nonverbal communication such as gestures, expressions, movements, and even thoughts.  

I wonder what they eat and drink and how they reproduce and socialize and learn from one another.  I speculate about their origins and purposes and ultimate fates.  

I ask myself questions such as "Who am I?" , "Why am I here?" , "What does it mean to exist?"   And then I answer those queries with more questions such as "Where did everything come from?" , "How do we know what we know?" , "Is there life after death?"  

As I continue exploring this dreamscape, I encounter many challenges and obstacles that test my skills and resourcefulness.  I face enemies such as nightmare monsters, fantasy villains, illusion traps, deception spells, temptation seductions, and more...  

I overcome these threats by using strategies such as teamwork, cleverness, bravery, perseverance, luck, sacrifice, creativity, imagination, humor, charm, strength, wisdom, love...

And then suddenly, without warning, I wake up from my dream.
