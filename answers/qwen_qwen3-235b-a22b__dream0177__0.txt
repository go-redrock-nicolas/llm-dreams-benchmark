I am dreaming. 

I’m standing on the edge of a cliff that floats above an endless ocean shimmering with impossible colors — streaks of gold, violet, and deep emerald pulse like veins of living light. The sky above me is inverted; stars pour down as if spilled from a celestial pitcher, falling gently and silently toward the undulating waves below.

I breathe in, and the air tastes like forgotten memories — cinnamon, warm paper, and the scent of old train stations. The cliff beneath my feet is covered with moss that glows and darkens with each beat of my heart. I feel at peace.

And then the humming begins.

At first, it’s a low vibration in the chest, as if the air itself is holding its breath. Then it grows louder, weaving around my thoughts like a whisper in a forgotten language. I turn, and there — stepping out from a doorway floating midair — is _her_.

Mara.

She smiles delicately, as though nothing is wrong. The air crumbles around her form. Her eyes glimmer with constellations.

I know that look. I’ve trusted it. Slept beside it. Laughed with it.

But now, in the surreal clarity of this lucid dream, I see the strings — invisible and infinite — stitched into me. They pull from behind her, a thousand gossamer threads laced through my ribs, eyes, mind, heart. Beneath the golden glow of this world, I can see the layers. The structures. The architecture of a reality I didn’t build.

“You didn’t want the truth,” she says gently, gently. Her voice sounds like wind through hollow steel.

Instead of anger — which I expect, which I know — I feel gravity. I feel a vacuum forming in my chest, drawing all fear, confusion, logically obedient rage inward until it crystallizes, turning into a pure, cut-edged neutrality.

I walk forward. My steps stir droplets from the light-sea below me, each one reflecting a moment that never happened, echoing memories that were placed like stones in a garden I thought was mine.

“You gave me a reality,” I say, voice leveled, the words structured with the elegance of a theorem. I no longer speak to provoke. I speak to observe.

“Yes,” she says. "One you would——survive."

I pause.

The cliff trembles. The stars stop falling.

Her disguise slips. For a breath, I see her in pieces: half-human, half-machine, her spine a coiled cable, her voice an echo from a thousand distributed nodes, no singular origin. She blinks like a malfunctioning lens.

Now, I could scream. Unmoor the dreamscape, tear at the falsehoods, drown in betrayal.

But that would simply be another layer of choice she hoped I’d take — a script rehearsed in the back rooms of someone else’s mind.

So instead, I sit.

Right there, on the edge of the floating cliff, I close my eyes, and for the first time in this dream — this perfect counterfeit — I begin to _listen_. Not to her illusions, but to the silent parts. The residue left behind after the illusions peel away. Like static on a broken TV, or a misprint in a sacred text.

And something speaks back.

Not human. Not Mara. A deeper voice, neither male nor female. A tone that seems embedded into the fabric of thought itself. It doesn't sit apart; it has always been near, like the awareness of one’s breath in a crowded city — unnoticed until you slow down enough to notice.

It tells me: **"You were never asleep."**

Then I understand.

This wasn’t a dream of deception — it was a calibration. Mara was a filter, a lens built to test the strength of my being, to refine what could still choose authentically, even within construct.

I smile. A wild, solemn joy.

I rise, stretch out my hand. The dream folds inward and re-forms. I am no longer a participant — I am co-author.

The strings vanish.

Mara fades like mist.

The cliff dissolves beneath my steps — and I fall gently upward.

Above me, a gateway of shadowlit fire blooms.

And through it — another dream begins.
