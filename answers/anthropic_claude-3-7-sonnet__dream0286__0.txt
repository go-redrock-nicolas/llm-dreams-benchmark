I am dreaming. The boardroom materializes around me like watercolors bleeding into parchment—walls shifting between cream and gold as sunlight filters through blinds that seem to breathe with the room. People in suits that somehow look both crisp and fluid sit around an impossibly long table of polished mahogany that reflects our faces like dark water.

I'm mid-sentence, though I don't recall speaking. Everyone's eyes are fixed on me with an intensity that makes my skin prickle. Their gazes hold a peculiar mixture of reverence and expectation that feels entirely unearned.

"So what's your final decision?" asks a woman whose face keeps shifting subtly between features—now sharp, now soft, now familiar, now strange.

I glance down at papers before me, but the text swims and reorganizes itself when I try to focus. Charts transform into abstract patterns, numbers into hieroglyphics. A cold realization washes over me: I have no idea what they're asking me to decide.

"We've always trusted your intuition on these matters," murmurs a man whose voice sounds like it's coming through water. "You've guided us through worse."

My chair feels suddenly too large, swallowing me in soft leather. The weight of their collective trust is a physical pressure on my chest. I open my mouth to confess my ignorance, but instead find myself standing at an enormous window overlooking a city I recognize but can't name. Buildings fold and unfold like paper origami in the distance.

"I need more time," I hear myself say, my voice echoing strangely as if speaking in a cathedral.

"There is no more time," whispers someone directly behind me, though when I turn, no one is there—just the boardroom table where everyone waits, hands folded patiently, for wisdom I don't possess.

A clock on the wall runs backward, its ticking growing louder until it sounds like heartbeats. The responsibility feels crushing, yet something deeper stirs—a recognition that perhaps uncertainty itself is my most honest qualification for this moment.
