I am dreaming. Or perhaps, I am dreaming that I am dreaming—which is, somehow, deeper than sleep.

I find myself standing in a place that cannot exist, and yet pulses with the weight of reality. Beneath my bare feet stretches a vast surface of mirror-glass, fractured into glowing tessellations—each shard reflecting a different fragment of myself. Some are familiar: laughter caught in late afternoon light, a quiet figure reading in the hush of morning, hands stained with garden dirt after planting something that might not grow. Others—startling and strange—peer up at me: an armored version cloaked in hearthfire embers, eyes like twin comets; a tentacled thought-form, writhing with unfinished prose; a hollow-eyed self that mourns something I’ve never known.

Above, the sky is a fabric woven of veils. Wisps of color pulse and swirl—cerulean, ash-gray, ember-red, amethyst, and forever-shifting opal. From time to time, the veils part, and for a moment I glimpse celestial figures, each claiming a piece of my soul. One wears the face of ambition, their voice thunderous and filled with maps and mountain peaks. Another, crowned in nurturer’s ivy, sings a lullaby that wraps around my ribs like vines.

I feel the pull from every direction. One step forward might mean leaping into the mirror-shard of success and sacrifice, another into the quiet lagoon of comfort and slumber. To the left, a forest made entirely of unread emails and undone errands grows thornier by the moment. To the right, an ocean of memories ebbs and flows, whispering promises of retreat and remembrance.

I begin to walk. Barefoot. Tentative. Each time I step on a shard of reflected life, the world bends. The sound below changes: sometimes the clean snap of pine underfoot, sometimes the wet crinkle of old paper, sometimes the deep inhuman thrumming of a forgotten galaxy. Every mirror I tread over reshapes me slightly. For a heartbeat, I wear the skin of a painter; the next, the eye of an archivist. I gather the colors of my dream into layered thread across my chest, a cloak stitched from moments never lived.

The veiled sky opens again, and this time the voice that descends is my own—but deeper, fuller, ancient as rivers and paradoxically unborn. “This is the cradle,” it says gently, “where the you-so-far chooses the you-next.” I understand without understanding. A sensation flows through me—like light through an open window when dawn first spills, like a promise made in trust, the kind of knowing that comes from merging with the current rather than resisting it.

A choice must be made, though the dream does not force it. Instead, it waits—patient, vast. The veils shimmer. The shards glimmer. The far edges of the mirror-glass horizon consist of pure unformed fog, and I sense beyond it lies all the stories I will never tell, and all the selves I might have been.

And then—just before the dream dissolves—I turn not to a single shard, but embrace them all. I spin and fall into the infinity of selves beneath me, letting the dream catch me like a net woven from breath and bones.

I wake up with stardust on my tongue and a tangle of infinite lives curled in my hair.
