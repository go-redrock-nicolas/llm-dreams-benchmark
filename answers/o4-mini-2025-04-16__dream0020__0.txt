I am dreaming. As you enter the venue, the heavy velvet curtains part with a silent sigh, revealing a vast chamber whose walls ripple like liquid moonlight. Under your feet, the marble floor feels improbably warm and soft, as though molded from the downy underside of clouds. A tinkling chandelier—each crystal teardrop suspended by threads of spun silver—pours a gentle rain of prismatic light across the room, scattering flecks of violet and emerald onto every surface.  

At the far end, a long banquet table hewn from pale driftwood floats just above the floor, its surface laden with confections you can barely name: luminous fruits that glow like embers, pastries that exhale soft wreaths of mint and rose, goblets brimming with a wine that tastes at once of years past and promise yet to come. The air is warm, scented faintly of jasmine and cedar smoke, and faint strains of a distant harp weave through the hush, tugging at your chest like a half-remembered lullaby.  

Figures emerge from the shifting veil of light: there’s Mara, her laughter now low and guarded, the childhood friend you once traced secret maps with under the stars. Beside her stands your old college roommate, Dex, who once held grudges so tight they seemed to fuse his bones, yet tonight his posture is strangely relaxed, his eyes glimmering behind the rims of a familiar pair of wire-framed glasses. And there—so close you can see the tremble in her breath—is Lina, the person you left with unspoken words in your last goodbye. Her hair spills over her shoulders like ink on parchment, and when your eyes meet, you feel the electric tug of years of both longing and regret.  

As you step forward, the banquet table drifts aside on unseen currents, clearing a path that glides through rows of gleaming columns. Each column is carved with scenes from your shared past—sunlit forests where you ran barefoot, late-night kitchens heavy with laughter, storm-lashed porches where tears were shed in silence. The images ripple, rearranging themselves whenever you look away, as if memory itself is alive and still rewriting its story.  

A cool breeze stirs the air, carrying the faintest echo of voices—snatches of old arguments, peals of joyous celebration, the whisper of apologies never uttered. You realize the walls aren’t solid at all but woven from shifting scenes, like pages in a storybook flipping themselves backward and forward at once. Shadows flit across your vision, and for a moment you think you see a younger version of yourself, running ahead on some hidden path, beckoning you onward.  

Somewhere to your left, Dex raises his glass in a silent toast; on your right, Mara’s lips curve into a tentative smile that trembles with hope and worry in equal measure. Lina takes a hesitant step forward, the tension between you coiling tight, like a spring ready to release. Around you, the harp’s melody swells, as if urging you to break the years of silence.  

In that silver-lit hall of memories, you realize that this dream is more than a reunion—it is a crossroads. Ahead lies the choice: confront the chapters you left unfinished, or glide past them once more into the unknown. The air thrums with possibility, and though your heart hammers with both fear and longing, you find yourself reaching out—toward the drifting figures, toward the shimmering reflections of your own past—knowing that in this place, every unspoken word has the power to reshape the story yet to unfold.
