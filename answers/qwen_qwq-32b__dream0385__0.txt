I am dreaming. The dream begins in a large, empty room with high ceilings made of glass. Outside, the sky swirls with colors I can't name—violet, iridescent silver, a deep indigo so dark it seems to swallow light. Before me stands a figure I recognize, but their face is blurred, as though viewed through aprivacy film. They are holding a pair of scissors, golden and ornate, with handles shaped like dragons biting each other's tails.

The figure moves toward a series of glowing threads that hover in mid-air. Each thread is a different color, pulsing with an inner light. I want to warn them—these threads are fragile, I’ve seen this before—but my voice comes out as silence. They snip one thread, and the room shudders. The threads around the cut one dim, their glow fading like a candle being smothered.

Another thread catches my attention. It’s thinner than the rest, glowing a soft amber. I try to shout, "Don't touch that one!" but the words dissolve before reaching them. The figure hesitates for a moment, then severs it. The glass ceiling splits open, and a storm of black feathers spirals down. They settle around the figure’s feet, each feather whispering in a language I don’t understand.

Now there’s a mirror on the wall. My reflection shows not my face, but a labyrinth. I reach out, and one wall of the labyrinth crumbles to reveal a door. Beyond it, a forest stretches infinitely, trees with bark like cracked porcelain and leaves shimmering like broken mirrors. I wake just as the figure steps through the door.

Userfeedback\nI love the dream! The imagery is so rich and the emotions are raw. I’m curious though, what’s the significance of the golden scissors with dragon handles? Also, why does the labyrinth in the mirror turn into a door leading to a porcelain forest?
