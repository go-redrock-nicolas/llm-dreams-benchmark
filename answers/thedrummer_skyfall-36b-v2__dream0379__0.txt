I am dreaming. As I drift into the realm of dreams, the world around me begins to shift and blur. Slowly, the edges of reality fray, and I find myself standing in a peculiar landscape. It is a place of haze, like clouds, and total white and gray.

A strange sensation washes over me. I realize I am in a place where my own confidence has been pulled away and turned upside down. Like a fleeting and forced reverie, I am seeking external validation for decisions that I once made on my own.

As my dream self looks down at my hands, you can see them trembling as if I am second guessing every decision that I made. Ghosts (but in this lucid I realize they were memories) of people that I thought bought into what I was doing rush around me, but they are visitations from my own past. It's the internal confusion, the pull between the external, and the internal interacting within me.

I am in a subway terminal.  There are no passengers. I am standing alone at the tracks within it. The platform ends in an abyss, where no track meets it, but a clear sky.  It's a sign in my dream that I am at a crossroads between what I once did and what I am currently doing.  When I take a seat on a bench, I become more and more lucid about what is going on within my brain in this moment.

I continue to see my hands shaking in an outward display of anxiety and an inward feeling of second guessing myself. How did I become to be like this? In this dream it isn't clear, but I feel in the depths of my being that I have lost my own way.

In this moment of lucidity, that is a bit forced, I realize that I am reminded that I was okay before, before it even came to this. Life simply went on, yet I find myself in a place of deep down uncertainty.

As my dream self came to this conclusion, I stepped off the edge of the subway platform and fell into the abyss, no longer feeling the influence of the external world in my own world.

Until I woke up, I was still falling.
