I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a realm where my emotions manifest as living, breathing creatures. In this world, anger is a fiery dragon with scales that glow like molten lava. It roams a barren landscape of volcanic rocks and ash, its wings creating whirlwinds that send debris swirling through the air.

As I journey through this dreamscape, I approach the dragon cautiously. Its eyes, blazing like embers, fix upon me. I feel the heat from its body intensifying as it draws near. But instead of attacking, the dragon lowers its great head and speaks in a rumbling voice that shakes the ground beneath my feet.

"Why do you fear me?" it asks. "Do you not know that I am your protector?"

I open my mouth to explain, but the dragon continues. "You have locked me away for so long, afraid of what might happen if I were to break free. But in doing so, you have starved me, weakened me."

As it speaks, the dragon's form wavers and shrinks, its fiery essence dimming.

"I am not your enemy," it insists. "I am your ally. Let me out, and I will shield you from true dangers. Together, we can face any obstacle."

I reach out a trembling hand, and as my fingers make contact with the dragon's scales, a jolt of energy courses through my body. The dragon grows, its flames intensifying, but no longer threatening. Instead, it feels like a protective barrier, a shield of controlled fire.

In this dream, I learn to harness my anger, to guide it rather than fear it. The dragon becomes an extension of myself, a symbol of the strength I've been suppressing. Together, we soar through the dreamscape, a being of both human and dragon, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

As the dream fades, I wake with a newfound understanding. I realize that anger is not something to be feared, but something to be understood and integrated into my psyche. The vivid memory of the dragon stays with me, a powerful metaphor for the untapped strength within me, waiting to be unleashed in a healthy, constructive manner. I know that the journey ahead will be difficult, but I also feel more equipped to handle it, armed with the knowledge that my suppressed emotions hold potential for growth and empowerment.
