I am dreaming. The air smells like burnt sugar and forgotten seasons.  I’m standing on a bridge made of stacked dictionaries, their leather bindings cracked and swollen with secrets.  Beneath me, the river flows in reverse—upwards, in thick curls of mercury, carrying upside-down trees whose roots glow like drowned campfires.  A chorus of my past selves hums from the water, their voices tangled in the roots.  They sound worried.

I clutch the bridge’s iron railing, its coldispersing through my palms.  The dictionaries groan as I shift my weight.  Each step forward erases the page beneath my shoe, scattering letters that form words I’ve never seen before.  *Mal Gibber*, I read, then *Slinkspire*.  The syllables slink into the clouds.  Grammar gnats swarm my ears, translating the air into riddles.

What’s different this time?  I mutter to the nearest grammar gnat, which resembles a wasp in a pinstripe suit.  It adjusts its monocle and recites, “You are navigating a transition where the rules no longer bend to your expertise.  This time, you must become the bend itself.”  Its thorax glows with a nervous blue light.

I blink and the bridge is gone.  I’m sinking into a library—no, a *timepiece library*.  Its shelves spiral inward, each volume labeled with years.  1997 crackles with fireflies.  2003 weeps liquid paper.  2023?  A hollow shell.  My fingers trace the spine, and the year shatters into origami birds.  They flutter into a vortex above, shaping a face: mine, but younger, wiser.  An echo speaks.  “You’ve always remade worlds by rearranging their edges.  Now you must rearrange yourself.  Begin by unlearning what you know of endings.”

Somewhere, a grandfather clock coughs.  The shelves begin to collapse like a wrapping ribbon.  I dive into an open book.  Its pages are oceans, and I swim through chapters lit by bioluminescent psalm verses.  A whale composed of forgotten memories surges past, singing in a language of harmonics.  *You have outgrown the cadence*, it intones.  *Find the meter in the silence between heartbeats.*

I surface onto a shore of parchment fragments.  The horizon stitches itself into a tapestry of crosshatched roads.  Each thread a choice.  Each choice a.  The grammar gnats gather, forming a bridge of their iridescent wings.  Above, the upside-down trees now bloom with eyes.  They watch.  They whisper.  A question echoes from the roots below: *What transition would you have become, if you hadn’t been afraid?*

I close my eyes, let the burnt sugar scent fill my lungs.  The humming of past selves shifts to a chord of resolve.  I step forward—not onto the gnats’ fragile bridge, but into the eyes of the inverted forest.  Their blossoms part like welcoming jaws.  I fall upwards, through the mercury sky, and wake clutching a new language in my throat, one that tastes of endings begun, not finished.
