I am dreaming. 1. The atmosphere around me is electric, charged with a mix of awe and pressure. The air hums with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of reality is straining under the weight of the problem I'm supposed to solve. 2. I'm standing in a vast, luminescent library. Every book glows with a soft inner light, casting prismatic patterns on the marble floors. The shelves spiral upwards into a starry sky, each constellation a symbol from a forgotten mathematical theorem. 3. My hands float in front of me, not entirely my own. They move through the air, sketching equations that materialize like ink in water. The numbers and symbols swirl, forming intricate, three-dimensional knots that shimmer with possibility. 4. A voice echoes, not from a mouth but from the collective consciousness of the universe itself. It speaks in a language older than words, patterns and harmonies that my mind translates into hypotheses. The voice warns: "The answer lies where logic bends, but to see it, you must unsee what you know." 5. I step into a void, a blackboard floating in endless darkness. Symbols bleed across the surface, some coherent, others gibbering with chaos. A shadowy figure resembling myself, but inverted in hue and thought, emerges. It holds a compass glowing with borrowed starlight. 6. We duel mentally, equations clashing like swords. Each strike etches a paradox into the dark, revealing fleeting glimpses of solutions that dissolve when grasped. The mirror-me whispers, "What if one is none, and none is all?" 7. A rupture tears open in the void—a kaleidoscopic storm of geometric shapes. Hypercubes flower, their edges lined with ancient axioms. Points of light form into constellations that chant proofs in binary. I reach, and my fingers pass through them, leaving trails of iridescent mist. 8. The dream fractures. I plummet through a realm of folded time, equations appearing on tombstones, graffiti on celestial highways. A moth with fractal wings lands on my shoulder, its scales shifting theorems. "The proof is the question," it says, vanishing in a burst of gamma rays. 9. I wake, heart pounding, synapses crackling. On my palm is a single symbol—a sigil woven from Fermat's Last Theorem and Riemann's hypothesis, glowing faintly before dissolving into the of my skin.
