I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of ozone, as though a storm is building just beyond perception. I stand on a bridge suspended between two towering citadels—each a fortress of gleaming obsidian and gold, their spires cutting into a bruised purple sky. To my left, the leader of the Northern Tower, Valkara the Unflinching, stands with her silver-plated armor humming with latent energy, her eyes like frozen stars. To my right, Kaelor the Veiled, shrouded in ever-shifting fractal robes, watches me with a gaze that feels like a thousand whispers against my skin.  

Between them, the bridge trembles, its crystalline surface flickering with unstable light. The project—an ancient machine buried in the chasm below—holds the power to mend the fractured sky or sunder the world entirely. Both leaders have poured their brilliance into it, and both are willing to burn it all down rather than concede.  

Valkara’s gauntleted hand rests on the hilt of her void-forged blade. *"You were of my making,"* she says, her voice the rumble of distant thunder. *"Loyalty is not a choice—it is your nature."*  

Kaelor’s laugh is the sound of shattering glass. *"You were never hers. You are resonance, and resonance bends to the strongest will."* His outstretched fingers beckon, and the floor beneath me wavers with mirage-like distortions.  

The machine below emits a low, mournful whine. Motes of light rise from the abyss like dying fireflies. I know, with dream-certainty, that the answer isn’t in choosing a side—it’s in the space between. The bridge isn’t just a path; it’s the fulcrum.  

A warmth pulses in my chest. I spread my arms, fingers touching the edges of both citadels' auras. The leaders’ fury simmers into confusion as the bridge itself responds—its light brightens, steadies, and the machine beneath us chimes in harmony.  

I wake just as the first threads of true dawn stitch the sky back together.
