I am dreaming. The air in the vast, echoing gallery hums with anticipation, thick and almost viscous, like honey stirred by an invisible hand.  It clings to my skin, a nervous static charge. Before me stands *The Murmuring Orrery*, my creation, birthed from countless sleepless nights and fragments of my soul given form. It's not just metal and glass; it's woven starlight and whispered secrets, a mechanical representation of the universe filtered through the messy, fragile lens of my own heart. Gears crafted from polished obsidian mesh with delicate filigree of moonlight-silver. Within its intricate clockwork, tiny, luminous spheres of captured dreams pulse with a soft, internal glow, orbiting a central core of raw, unshielded emotion – a pulsing, iridescent crystal that shifts color with every beat of my own anxious heart. This is it. This is everything I am, laid bare under the unforgiving glare of the gallery lights.

Then, they arrive. The critics. They move like shadows given substance, their faces sculpted from granite and doubt. Their eyes, sharp and dissecting, rake over my creation, missing none of its intentional imperfections, its vulnerable seams. Their whispers begin, insidious tendrils of sound that slither through the expectant silence.

"Derivative," one murmurs, the word landing like a physical blow. His voice is dry, like autumn leaves crunching underfoot.

"Sentimental," another sneers, her lips curling with disdain. The word hangs in the air, sour and heavy.

"Technically accomplished, perhaps," concedes a third, his voice dripping with condescending civility, "but ultimately… hollow."

Each word is a shard of ice piercing my carefully constructed composure. My breath catches in my throat, sharp and painful. The vibrant colors of the Orrery seem to dim under their scrutiny, the pulsing light within the crystal heart flickering, threatening to extinguish. My own heart hammers against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the rising tide of their judgment. I feel exposed, utterly naked, as if they aren't just critiquing the intricate mechanics and artistic merit, but are peeling back layers of my own being, examining the raw, tender core I dared to reveal.

The gallery walls seem to close in, the polished floors reflecting distorted, mocking images of my terrified face. The humming anticipation curdles into a suffocating dread. I want to scream, to defend the fragile beauty I poured into the Orrery, to explain the significance of every gear, every captured dream-sphere. But my voice is trapped, a silent prisoner in my own throat.

A cold sweat prickles my skin. Their gazes feel like physical weights, pressing down on me, crushing the fragile hope that bloomed alongside my creation. The Murmuring Orrery, once a beacon of my innermost self, now feels like an indictment, a foolish testament to my own vulnerability. The crystal heart within it pulses erratically, mirroring my own panic, its light fading, fading… leaving me adrift in the echoing silence, pierced only by the phantom sting of their merciless words. The dreamscape shimmers, threatening to dissolve into the abyss of self-doubt they've so expertly carved.
