I am dreaming.

A celestial garden unfurls before me, where glass trees spiral skyward and their leaves are glimmering motes of memory, each trembling in an unseen breeze. Moonlight, impossibly silver and liquid, streams over everything, pooling on the soft moss between my bare feet. The air is alive with a thrumming hush, the sound of distant voices not quite forming words.

As I drift deeper into this opaline oasis, I encounter two enigmatic guides: one, a golden-eyed crane whose feathers shimmer like threads of sunrise, and the other, a gentle shadow shaped like my own reflection, its presence soothing as velvet dusk.

The crane steps lightly onto a sapphire boulder and offers its counsel in a crisp, melodic voice: "When the path forks, always choose the way lined with unfamiliar stones. Do not fear the strange; what you seek lies beyond the borders of comfort." The shadow, soft and certain, speaks after: "Your heart already knows the terrain. The comfort of the known will cradle you safely to your destination. Trust the worn path, it was made by your own feet in lives before this dream."

Between the two, a shimmering tension sizzles, urging me to choose. My intuition tugs me toward the wild, tangled trail—the one sprouting new stars in its wake. But the advice stands in stark contrast, guiding me to well-trodden certainty. My pulse thrums as I contemplate both.

In the dream, weighing the glimmering risk of the unknown against the inviting warmth of familiarity, I close my eyes. Imagination springs forth a third path, sewn together with fragments of both: a bridge arched across a river of impossible color, built from stones I gather as I walk, each stone a lesson from both intuition and instruction.

Crossing it, I feel the hush of the garden gather around me, a tender applause. I realize that to honor all wisdom, both inner and outer, is to forge a path uniquely my own—one that glows in the secret language of dreams, lit by both the heart’s longing and the mind’s careful guidance.
