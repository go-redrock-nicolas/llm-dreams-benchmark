I am dreaming. …find myself in an office unlike any I have ever known: not the sterile rectangles of fluorescent light and beige carpet, but an endless corridor that curves in impossible ways, its walls lined with glass panels behind which strange, ever-shifting dioramas play out—live memories, fears, fleeting bursts of inspiration, tumbling over one another like waves of color in water.

I walk slowly, my footfalls both echoing and muffled, as though the ground cannot decide if it wishes to reveal or conceal my presence. Invisible currents of anxiety brush past me, pulling at my sleeves.

I sense before I see the form of my colleague—a shape at once recognizable and unfamiliar, face flickering between smiles we shared and glances I’ve always mistrusted. Their desk, an island amid a swirling sea of floating reports and smudged color-coded schedules, tilts at a precarious angle.

I approach, heart thrumming, and as I confront them, the corridor's glass walls shimmer, casting us in shifting patterns: betrayal, disbelief, anger, and—sharper than all—the ache of injury where trust was whole.

"Why?" I ask—not with words, but with everything I am, the question blooming and echoing through the corridor.

My colleague’s eyes turn glassy, reflecting my own pain back at me. Papers flutter from their hands, transforming into origami birds that spiral upward, their wings whispering stories of one-upmanship and hushed conversations behind my back. Each bird bears a phrase I recognize, twisted and turned against me like knives.

But as I confront the betrayal, something shifts inside me—the old fear giving way to a surge of crystalline clarity. I realize that this is not only my colleague’s labyrinth, but my own as well. The corridor broadens, spilling with warm light. The birds, once hostile, soften their flight, circling us in a tentative dance.

With the strange wisdom that dreams provide, I extend a hand—not in forgiveness yet, but in strength. My voice threads through the corridor with new resonance: “You have wounded me, but you will not break me.”

The dream ends—not in violent confrontation, but in the quiet recognition of my own resilience, a silent vow that I will reclaim both my work and my sense of self. As I wake, the echo of the light lingers, carrying an unspoken promise: that even amidst betrayal, I can find my footing, and build anew.
