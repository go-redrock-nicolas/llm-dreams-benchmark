I am dreaming. <first-person POV>

The world around me is liquid light, and time drips not in minutes, but in sensations. I float through a sky stitched together with glowing threads, each strand a forgotten wish, a misplaced thought, or a word never spoken. Below me, mountains rise in spirals like frozen whirlpools, their crystal peaks humming in low, resonant tones.

I want to cry, I want to run — but I do not. I remain still, suspended between the pulse of stars.

This dream is different. It knows me in ways the waking mind forgets.

A great forest grows beneath me now, though I can’t tell if it's growing upward or downward — the trees wear faces carved from the wind, and their leaves whisper in a dialect much older than language. They say:

_${surrealism} {introspection} {truths that can't be carried back into daylight}~_

And I feel it: the slow crumbling of my armor made of expectations.

They were always there, weren't they? My demands, like tight vines twisting around moments before they could fully open. I built cages out of how things "should be"—expectations that closed around every joy, every grief, every opportunity, until all that remained was the shape of the cage, not what it held.

In my dream, a figure approaches. Or perhaps I approach myself.

It stands at the forest's edge—not quite man, not quite woman, but a vision lit from within. Its eyes are smooth mirrors, and when I look into them, I see not my face, but the places I’ve refused to feel.

Disappointment shared over unaired hopes. The sting of pride reframed as failure. The agony of watching life unfold without permission. My breath catches.

It says nothing, only gestures for me to follow.

We walk between trees that bend to listen to our footsteps.

Here, in this dream without judgment, I begin to understand that pain often isn’t born from what lives outside my control—but from how stubbornly I cling to believing I have any.

My guide stops at a pool of still sky — water thin enough for the galaxies to swim beneath. She points again — this time, at my reflection.

It’s not the face I know.

It’s stronger. Not because it knows the path ahead, but because it stands tall in the fog.

I realize, in that moment, it’s not about fixing what’s broken in me.

It’s about folding those broken pieces into my arms and walking anyway. Not pretending pain isn’t present—rather, making space for it to walk side by side with wonder.

I kneel, and dip my hand in the water. Ripples touch the stars like waves reaching across time.

Suddenly, the dream softens. The pressure of expectation that has somehow clung to me like second skin begins to dissolve into fluttering petals. Some land on my shoulders, some vanish mid-air. I let them go.

There is no need to command the tide.

There is only need to walk through the shore, shoes in hand, sand between my toes. Let waves come. Let them recede.

It is enough.

And as the dream fades, I am not left empty.

I am left open.  
Hollowed in just the right way to let the light pour in.
