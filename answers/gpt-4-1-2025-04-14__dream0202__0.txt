I am dreaming.

The world around me pulses with a surreal shimmer—a cityscape rippling like an oil painting in a gentle wind, all soft golden lamplight and cobbled streets stretching impossibly in every direction. In this boundless, dusky metropolis, I wander, drawn by the hush of possibility. 

Suddenly, the sensation drops into my awareness—an understanding so profound and unsettling that I stagger. That kindness, the deep wellspring I believed to be the very marrow of my being, was not born from my heart but engineered, expertly, through whispered words and silent nudges woven through the days of my life. Images flicker before my eyes: a parent’s gentle praise at opportune moments, friends steering conversations, the subtle rewards that shaped my actions like water shapes stone.

My breath catches. I look down and see not just the dreamscape streets beneath my feet, but footprints crisscrossing all around me—paths I never chose but was gently compelled to follow. Shock blooms into wonder and a shiver of fear; am I myself at all, or simply a collage crafted by unseen hands?

I reach out, hands trembling, and the air shimmers with strange, holographic glyphs—every memory of kindness, every decision made with gentle intention, written in iridescent script. I brush a memory with my fingertips and feel the duality: the genuine warmth within me, and the gentle hand that guided its growth. It is both me and not me—an echo of someone else’s hope for who I might be.

A hush—like the city holding its breath—settles around me as I consider: Do I recoil against this manipulation, or do I embrace the kindness, no matter its origin? The city seems to await my answer, its lights flickering in quiet sympathy.

At last, I find myself smiling—bitter, wry, but honest. Even if it was planted, the kindness has taken root. It flourishes now in the soil of my own heart, untamed and self-sustaining. In this lucid dream, I choose to own it. I step forward, letting the past conditioning fall around me like autumn leaves, and set out to cultivate kindness with intention, this time as an act of true will—cradling the knowledge that even gifts with hidden origins can be made wholly one’s own.
