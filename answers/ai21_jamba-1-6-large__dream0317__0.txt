I am dreaming. I take a moment to reflect before accepting the offer. I decide to walk up a trail called the Solar Path. 

It stretches up Mount Aetna, covered with snow and climbing steeply into a billowing, white fog. Several mountain goats roam the lower area. I greet several but realize that the language barrier prevents me from truly learning how to Climb with them. 

I climb alone up this path. I come to the fog. I step into it. Far above, above the blue sky and even space, I see Mars, Venus, and Earth. I keep climbing, but now I am smaller, with less air, and I start to fly. I leave my Earthly body behind me, along with my cares and worries. I keep going, see the rings of Saturn, and the sun rises in front of me. 

I leave this system. I am then overtaken by something. Something, which drags me back into the fog. I am there again, on Earth. But I am larger than before, and I enter this body again, happy for the new perspective I have gained on life. This body and Earth are mine, and I treat them well.
