I am dreaming. The entire universe dissolves into an ethereal haze before me. The deep violet expanse of space stretches infinitely before me, speckled with twinkling lights. I am standing on an island of crystal hovering in the cosmos, surrounded by celestial bodies of all sizes, each glowing a different, impossibly vibrant color. This cosmic archipelago is illuminated by distant stars, irradiating galaxies far away, casting spectral radiance on my being.

Drifting along the airwaves, I hear symphonies composed by cosmic winds, an orchestra of cosmic harmony. The music surrounds me, echoing the synchronized pulses of the planets, each playing its own melody in flawless tandem with every other.

The crystal beneath my feet resonates with energy, pulsating rhythmically in colors that mortal eyes have never witnessed. Every beat sends ripples through the island, outward to the surrounding cosmos, creating kaleidoscopic tsunamis of energy that sweep across the void.

Before me lies a crossroads woven from strands of starlight, each pathway leading towards a different destiny. The path of principles is adorned with glowing orbs of light, much like a luminescent garden of righteousness. It's challenging, filled with the weeds of hardship, but it's plentiful with the beautiful foliage of integrity, honesty, and morality.

On the other hand, the path of pragmatism is broad and clear, devoid of obstacles, with signposts of convenience, quick rewards, and readily tangible success. It's scattered with metallic coins, but their shine is dull compared to the radiant orbs of principles. This path is trodden more, its surface polished smooth by many feet, but its end is lost in shadows.

As I stand at this cosmic crossroad, a profound sensation of solitude takes hold. It's just me and the universe, with its colorful galaxies, rhythmic heartbeats, and Transcendent Music. The decision weighs on me, as if the gravity of a thousand galaxies is pulling me towards it.

Then, a celestial being composed of stardust appears before me. It looks at me with its starlit eyes and whispers in a voice that sounds like the birth of a supernova, "Choose with your heart, for that is the source of your true strength."

The decision is clear now. Despite the potential cost, the path of principles holds a different kind of wealth—a wealth of spirit, of soul, of the heart. I take a deep breath, drawing in the entire essence of the cosmos, and I step onto the path of principles. 

With each step I take, the challenges grow, but so does the radiance around me. The orbs of light bloom into resplendent gardens of virtues, bathing me in their spectral glow. The music of the cosmos intensifies, empowering me, guiding me forward.

As I move further along the path, the more radiant I become, transforming into a celestial being myself. I grow brighter and brighter until I become a supernova, exploding into an array of cosmic dust, scattering across the universe to form a new constellation—a testament to the belief that following one’s principles, even at great costs, leads to the most vibrant and harmonious existence.
