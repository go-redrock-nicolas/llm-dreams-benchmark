I am dreaming. In my dream, I am a young girl walking through a lush, green forest. The sun shines brightly, birds chirp merrily in the trees, and a gentle breeze rustles the leaves. I feel calm and peaceful as I continue on my journey.

As I walk deeper into the forest, the atmosphere changes. The trees grow larger, thicker, and darker. The air becomes heavy and oppressive, and the sound of birds and wind fades away. A thick fog begins to form around me, making it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead.

Suddenly, I hear a low growl that sends shivers down my spine. Out of the misty darkness, a large, black wolf emerges. Its fur bristles with anger, and its teeth glisten menacingly as it stalks towards me. My heart races, and my breathing becomes shallow.

Fear hits me like a tidal wave, but somehow, I manage to control my terror. Instead of running, I stand my ground and focus on the wolf's anger. The more I pay attention to its rage, the stronger it becomes. The wolf bares its teeth and lunges at me, but I don't flinch. Instead, I let out a primal scream of my own, releasing years of suppressed anger and fear.

The forest around us shakes with the force of my scream. The wolf pauses, surprised by my outburst. Slowly, it lowers its head, snarling but uncertain. A fierce light glows in my eyes as I continue to confront the beast. We stand facing each other, neither backing down, in a standoff of wills.

Suddenly, the forest begins to clear, and the sunlight returns. The angry wolf transforms into a small, wounded cub. It whimpers softly, looking up at me with big, sad eyes. I realize that the wolf was not the enemy but a reflection of my own repressed emotions.

With a sinking heart, I kneel down beside the cub and gently pick it up. Tears stream down my face as I cradle the trembling creature in my arms. I apologize to it for not understanding its pain before. In that moment, I vow to face my own anger and fear head-on, instead of suppressing them and letting them fester.

As I wake up from my dream, I know that this journey will not be easy, but it will be necessary for my growth and healing. I am grateful for this lesson and the opportunity to learn from it.
