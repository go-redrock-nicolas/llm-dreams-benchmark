I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the edge of an immense, iridescent canyon whose walls shimmer like a thousand stained-glass windows lit from within. A moment ago—though time in dreams is slippery—you had been soaring above this place on a living origami crane, convinced you could cross by air. But the crane dissolved in a swirl of luminous paper shards, abandoning you at the brink.

The canyon yawns beneath a violet sky veined with silver constellations that drift and rearrange like schools of cosmic fish. Far below, a river of liquid moonlight winds and roars; each surge flashes memories you thought you’d forgotten: a childhood snowfall, a first heartbreak, a laugh shared in candlelight. Crossing by flight is no longer an option. The challenge presses against your ribcage like a second heartbeat: find another way, or remain stranded where all paths end.

You close your eyes and feel the canyon’s breath—warm, pulsing, alive—as if it hopes you’ll discover its secret. When you open them again, the canyon walls subtly pulse with patterns: spirals, labyrinths, impossible geometries hinting at doors that flicker in and out of existence. A revelation arrives as swiftly as the folding crane had evaporated: the canyon is less a gap to be bridged than a song to be understood.

You kneel, palm to the crystalline dust, and listen. Faint vibrations thread up your arm—bass notes rumbling in tectonic cadence. You begin to hum, imitating the canyon’s subterranean melody. A chord resonates between your lungs and the canyon floor; the walls brighten, prisms rearranging into a glowing staircase of light and shadow, each step a perfect tone. The path is musical: you must walk the song into being.

Yet halfway down, discord intrudes—a sour note trembles underfoot, and the stair of light flickers, threatening collapse. Your initial improvisation falters. Panic coils, but you inhale a new resolve. Instead of pressing forward, you pivot: silence. You stop humming entirely. The canyon hushes in surprise, as though waiting for your next move.

From that stillness, you begin to whistle soft minor chords you’ve never heard in waking life—notes shaped like questions rather than declarations. The staircase reshapes, now curving downward in helixes of shimmering azure. You step onto the new coil, feeling the melodies alter the very gravity around you, turning descent into a gentle floating dance through air heavy with the scent of night-blooming flowers.

At last you reach the river of moonlight. Up close it is not water but a silky ribbon of liquid stars, whispering in languages made of light. You dip your fingers and the river projects luminous sigils across the canyon walls, revealing a raft waiting downstream—woven from dreams you abandoned long ago. You never built it consciously, yet here it is: the second plan that existed within you all along.

You board the raft, steering with a mast formed from the final shard of the origami crane’s paper—proof that failure can be repurposed. The river carries you beneath vaulted arches where meteors streak like golden fireflies, and you realize the canyon didn’t need to be conquered; it needed to be collaborated with, sung into cooperation.

As the opposite rim rises ahead—lush with silver grass and trees bearing lantern-bright fruit—you glance back. The canyon’s mouth closes into a serene smile of crystal ridges, as if satisfied with your willingness to transform. Somewhere overhead the constellations applaud, rearranging themselves into the silhouette of a crane taking flight once more.

And you, a dreamer made wiser by pivot and song, step ashore ready for whatever wonders wait beyond the glowing orchard—as dawn ripples across the horizon like the opening chord of a brand-new composition.
