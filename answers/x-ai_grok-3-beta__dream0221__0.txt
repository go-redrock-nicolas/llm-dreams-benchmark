I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world around me unfolds like a tapestry woven from the threads of the impossible. I find myself standing in a vast, ethereal arena, suspended in a twilight sky where the horizon blazes with hues of molten gold and violet, as if the universe itself is holding its breath in anticipation. The air hums with an electric energy, a chorus of whispers from an unseen crowd that seems to stretch into infinity. My heart beats like a drum, resonating with a rhythm I’ve never known but somehow understand instinctively. 

In this dream, I discover a latent talent for an extraordinarily difficult discipline I’ve never attempted before: glassblowing, but not in any ordinary sense. This is celestial glassblowing, the art of crafting stars and constellations from raw, shimmering nebula dust. My hands, unguided by any prior knowledge, move with a grace and precision that defy comprehension. I reach into the void, pulling strands of cosmic essence between my fingers, and as I breathe into them—a breath that feels like the sigh of a thousand galaxies—they transform into delicate, glowing orbs that pulse with the light of newborn suns. I shape nebulae into intricate spirals, weaving comets’ tails into fragile latticework that dances with iridescent sparks. Each piece I create is a miniature universe, alive with its own stories, and I feel as if I’ve tapped into the very heartbeat of creation itself.

I am not alone. A figure emerges from the twilight, clad in a robe of shimmering stardust, their eyes like twin black holes, endless and all-knowing. They speak in a voice that ripples through space, inviting me to demonstrate this newfound prowess publicly, to an assembly of celestial beings—guardians of the cosmos, architects of time, and keepers of forgotten dreams. The arena trembles as they gather, their forms shifting between shadow and light, some with wings of plasma, others with bodies of woven starlight. The weight of their gaze feels like a supernova pressing against my chest, yet there’s a warmth there, a curiosity that fuels my courage.

I step forward, my bare feet touching the cool, crystalline floor of the arena, which mirrors the endless expanse of the cosmos below. I raise my hands, and the nebula dust swirls around me like a living storm, eager to be shaped by my will. The crowd falls silent, the hum of anticipation replaced by a profound stillness, as if even the stars have paused their eternal dance to watch. I begin, my breath steady, my focus absolute. I sculpt a miniature galaxy, its spiral arms delicate as spun silk, dotted with tiny, radiant stars that flicker like fireflies in a summer night. I weave a ribbon of aurora through its center, a cascade of emerald and sapphire light that shimmers with a life of its own. With each movement, I pour my essence into the creation—my fears, my hopes, my unspoken dreams—until it hums with a resonance that echoes through the arena.

The celestial beings lean forward, their forms rippling with astonishment. A guardian with a crown of orbiting moons lets out a sigh that sends a ripple of warmth through the void. Another, whose body is a constellation of ever-shifting stars, extends a hand, and I feel their approval like a gentle tide washing over me. I realize then that this isn’t just a demonstration—it’s a communion, a sharing of something primal and infinite. I craft more, each piece bolder than the last: a comet with a tail of molten glass, a black hole encased in a fragile sphere of light, a pulsar that beats in time with my own heart. The arena becomes a gallery of my creations, a testament to a talent I never knew I possessed, shining against the backdrop of eternity.

Sweat beads on my brow, though I feel no exhaustion—only exhilaration, a boundless joy that surges through me like a cosmic current. When I finally lower my hands, the arena erupts in a symphony of light and sound, a celebration that shakes the very fabric of this dream-world. The stardust-robed figure approaches, their black-hole eyes now swirling with flecks of gold, and places a hand on my shoulder. “You have shaped the unshapable,” they murmur, their voice a melody of colliding galaxies. “You have given form to the formless. Carry this gift beyond the dream, for it is yours to wield.” 

As their words linger, the arena begins to dissolve, the twilight sky folding into itself like a collapsing star. Yet, the weight of their gaze, the glow of my creations, and the rhythm of my own breath remain etched into my soul. I awake with a gasp, the echoes of that cosmic applause still ringing in my ears, and I can’t help but wonder if somewhere, in the deepest parts of my being, that talent still waits to be unleashed into the waking world.
