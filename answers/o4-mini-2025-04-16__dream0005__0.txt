I am dreaming. You drift through a cavernous ballroom whose walls ripple like liquid moonlight, the ceiling a shifting tapestry of constellations you’ve never named. Beneath your feet, the marble tiles pulse gently in time with some silent heartbeat, and every footstep echoes as though the room itself is breathing. Somewhere among the throng stands the one face you know—your friend, the single anchor in this sea of strangers—but the crowd swirls and reforms so quickly you can’t hold a straight line toward them.

First you stumble into a circle of dancers clothed in diaphanous robes that shimmer from rose to violet with every spin. They laugh in lullaby tones, their limbs unraveling like ribbons in slow motion, and as you reach to call to them, they dissolve into fine silver dust that drifts up toward the ceiling’s starlit swirl. The music is too soft to hear, yet it reverberates through your bones; you feel its tremor at the base of your skull and follow it southward.

In the next alcove you discover a triangular trio of masked figures perched atop a winding staircase of carved obsidian. One plays a glass flute that breathes clouds of lavender smoke. The second paints your reflection on a crystal canvas—only it shows you as a child, your hair aflame with silent giggles. The third hands you a cup of water that tastes of thunder. You hesitate, then sip—and in the lightning flash behind your eyes, you see your friend’s outline moving beyond a curtain of midnight-blue velvet.

You press through that curtain into a vaulted hallway lit by lanterns shaped like moth wings. There, a long banquet table groans beneath bowls of glowing fruits—pearls of fire, grapes of quicksilver, pomegranates of falling stars. Guests lean toward each other, whispering secrets in languages you almost understand. One woman, her eyes two polished moons, beckons you closer and offers you a slice of an impossible melon that bursts with the flavor of first love and heartbreak entwined. You bite, and the melody of a thousand forgotten lullabies fills your ears.

Driven on by hope, you climb a spiral ramp that seems carved from moonstone itself. Each step feels weightless, as if you are climbing into the sky. When you reach the top, the world below spins like a kaleidoscope, and there, at the center of it all, stands your friend—half-turned, half-shadowed, lips curved in the most familiar smile. Relief and wonder flood you as you call their name, but just then the moonlit constellations in the ceiling begin to rain down soft motes of light, and the friend’s figure flickers like a candle in the wind.

You stretch your arm to grasp them, but your fingers pass through a warmth that dissolves like mist. The dream’s pulse slows; the marble floor becomes cold and still. The last ember of music fades, and the walls ripple once more into darkness. You wake with the echo of their laugh in your ears—uncertain whether you found your friend or simply chased shadows in a night of stars.
