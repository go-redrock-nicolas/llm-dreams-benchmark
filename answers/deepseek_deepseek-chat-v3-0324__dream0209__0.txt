I am dreaming. The air hums with an electric strangeness, thick and syrupy, as if I’m wading through liquid light. The sky—if it can be called a sky—is a swirling tapestry of iridescent fractals, pulsing with colors that have no name in my world. The ground beneath me is neither solid nor liquid, but something in between, shifting like mercury under my feet, yet somehow holding my weight.  

I take a step forward, but my body doesn’t move the way it should. Instead of pushing off with my muscles, I feel a strange, magnetic pull—as if the space itself decides where I go. My limbs respond not to my will, but to unseen currents, like a leaf caught in a phantom wind. I try to lift my hand, but it drifts upward in slow, spiraling motions, as though gravity here is a suggestion rather than a law.  

A sound thrums in the distance—a deep, resonant frequency that vibrates through my bones. It’s not a noise, but a *presence*, a force that tugs at my very being. I realize, with a jolt of wonder, that this is how things move here. Not by pushing or pulling, but by *harmonizing*—aligning with the hidden rhythms of this world.  

I close my eyes (or at least, I think I do—sensation is different here) and try to *listen* with more than my ears. The sound grows clearer, a cascading melody of invisible energies. I let go, surrendering to its flow, and suddenly—I am gliding. Not walking, not flying, but *being carried* by the unseen song of this dimension.  

Around me, shapes flicker in and out of existence—structures that defy geometry, living things that are neither plant nor animal, but something else entirely. They pulse and shift in time with the hidden music, their forms constantly rearranging. I reach out, and my fingers pass through a shimmering veil of light, sending ripples through the fabric of this reality.  

For a moment, I understand. Here, movement isn’t about force—it’s about resonance. To walk is to sing. To exist is to dance.  

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream fractures—the colors bleed, the sound unravels—and I am falling, falling back into the familiar pull of gravity, the solid weight of my own world.  

I wake with a gasp, my skin tingling, the echo of that otherworldly song still humming in my veins.
