I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful old growth forest with lush ferns and boulders covered in moss and lichen.  The only sounds are the distant calls of birds and the crunching of leaves as I walk.  The air is warm and smells of earth and greenery.  I feel completely at peace.

I come to a wide, shallow river.  I notice the water is an unusual, vibrant shade of blue.  I wade in and notice the water is the perfect temperature--not too warm or cool.  I fall back and let myself float in the gently moving current.  A hummingbird comes and drinks from the surface of the water right in front of me.

I feel myself start to transform.  I have gills and fins and I can breathe underwater.  I swim and glide through the river, fully submerged, and see many beautiful fish and aquatic plants.  I swim through underwater canyons covered in sparkling minerals of every color.

I see many sparkling minerals and gemstones.  I ride on the back of a giant sea turtle, getting to know him.  We pass by a group of merpeople tending their gardens, growing fruits and vegetables of many colors.  They welcome me with open arms and share their harvest.

I am filled with a sense of belonging and never want to leave, but reluctantly wake up in my bed.  The dream was so vivid, it felt real.  I cherish the joy and peace from the dream in my heart.  I know I can return to that magical place in my dreams anytime I need solace.
