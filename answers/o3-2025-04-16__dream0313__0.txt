I am dreaming. …decide to lean into the dream instead of dodging it with another one-liner.

The moment you make that decision, the scene warps around you like a watercolor drenched in too much rain. Colors bleed; shapes buckle. A jelly-pink horizon peels back to reveal a vast amphitheater made entirely of stained-glass ribs. They arch overhead, clinking like wind chimes with every breath you take. The floor is a lake—violet, viscous, reflective as polished obsidian—yet somehow you can walk on it, each step sending ripples that ring like silver laughter.

A spotlight—no, a moon-sized dandelion puff glowing gold—descends from nowhere and fixes on a solitary podium at center stage. Perched atop it is a marionette that looks exactly like you, except its smile is permanently twisted into a comedian’s sneer. The puppet dangles its limbs, jerking into a vaudeville bow.

“Thank you, thank you, I’ll be here all night!” it cackles, voice cracked and squeaky. Its wooden joints click together in a rimshot. “Two traumas walk into a bar…”

There it is—your reflexive punchline before the ache even gets a chance to speak. A bead of shame pricks your chest, but in this dream, emotions leak as visible mist: a bruised-violet fog seeps from your sternum, curling like smoke.

You inhale, steadying. “Not this time,” you mutter.

A hush falls over the stained-glass ribs. The puppet freezes, tilted mid-joke. The violet lake stills, as though respecting your request. From the horizon, a distant rumble swells—an avalanche of memories gathering momentum.

They arrive as floating picture frames: translucent, luminescent, orbiting you in widening rings. In each frame glimmers a moment you usually shrug off with an eye-roll and a quip.

Frame #1: A hospital corridor, linoleum reflecting harsh fluorescence. You, age thirteen, clutching a Styrofoam cup of vending-machine cocoa, knees jelly, waiting for news about a father who will never walk again. In real life you’d cracked, “Well, guess he’s taking the lazy-boy title literally now.” Everyone laughed. Tonight, the cup shakes in your trembling hands; cocoa sloshes over the brim; the image smells of antiseptic and burnt sugar.

Frame #2: A shattered phone screen glowing 4:17 a.m., the text: SHE’S GONE. You’d texted back, “Well, she always knew how to make an exit.” It got zero emojis in return. In the dream, though, the phone vibrates with a hum that sounds like a sob.

Frame #3: A birthday cake melting in a torrential September rain because the surprise party spilled onto the driveway while the paramedics loaded someone into an ambulance. You’d posed with the sagging candles and said, “Hey, at least the candles are self-extinguishing!” Click. Flash. Laughter mixed with thunder.

The marionette atop the podium twitches, trying to break into another joke, but its strings fray, snap. It tumbles into the violet lake with a splash that blooms like spilled ink. Slowly, it floats away facedown, silent.

You feel the urge to toss out a wisecrack about littering but bite it back. Instead, you step forward, your soles sending tremors across the lake. Each tremor knocks a picture frame loose; it descends like a fallen halo until it hangs in front of your chest.

You choose the hospital scene first. As you touch the frame, its glass turns to water, and the corridor’s fluorescent buzz pours into your ears. You smell iodine, hear the squeak of rubber soles. Thirteen-year-old you stands inside the frame, cocoa cup trembling. You speak softly:

“It hurt too much to show it, didn’t it?”

The younger you nods but doesn’t cry; tears are trapped under the surface like fish under ice. You reach in, pressing a palm to the glassy water. It warms, then melts. The corridor dissolves, leaving your younger self chest-deep in the violet lake beside you. Together, you both breathe in the dandelion-light.

For the first time, your default chuckle is replaced by silence. It feels raw, like a skinned knee, but honest. The puppet carcass drifts past, rotates, looks up—its painted grin has washed away, revealing a plain wooden face, blank and vulnerable.

One by one, you touch each frame. Each memory relinquishes its punchline in exchange for its pulse: the phone’s vibration turning into a heartbeat, the rain-soaked cake morphing into the scent of vanilla mingled with petrichor. The more you allow yourself to feel, the brighter the stained-glass ribs glow, transforming from rigid prison bars into a cathedral of living color.

Eventually the violet lake drains through invisible cracks, and you stand on the dream’s raw, root-tangled earth. Fireflies shaped like punctuation marks—question marks, commas, ellipses—flutter around you, waiting for you to decide how the sentence ends.

You open your mouth. A joke hovers on your tongue, but it tastes like sawdust. Instead you sigh, and the sigh becomes a small, appropriate laugh: gentle, acknowledging, free of scorn.

The world unknots. The dandelion moon rises, seeds scattering into constellations. A ladder made of piano keys unfurls from above, each rung playing a note as it touches down. You place a foot on the first key. It sings in a minor chord—beautiful, complicated, unresolved.

You climb anyway, ascending through the pulsing ribs of stained glass, carrying no puppet, no punchline—only a melody that admits its sorrow and keeps going.

Somewhere far below, the marionette’s voice calls, softer now, almost grateful: “Goodnight, folks… Goodnight.”

You keep climbing, into dawn.
