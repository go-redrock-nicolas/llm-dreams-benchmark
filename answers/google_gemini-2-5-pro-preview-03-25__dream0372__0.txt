I am dreaming. I am standing on the precipice of a vast, shimmering canyon. The air hums with an unseen energy, thick and sweet like honeysuckle nectar. Below me, instead of rock and dust, the canyon floor is a swirling vortex of iridescent colors – sapphire blues merging into emerald greens, bleeding into ruby reds and amethyst purples. It pulses with a gentle, rhythmic light, like the slow beat of a cosmic heart.

For a long moment, I hesitate. My hands instinctively clutch at my sides, a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. *There isn't enough,* a voice whispers, a relic of waking worries. *What if I fall? What if it disappears? What if I reach for it and find nothing?* This canyon, this incredible spectacle, feels too magnificent, too *much* for me. The old habit of fear, of believing resources are finite and must be guarded fiercely, clings to me like a shroud.

But then, a warm, golden light begins to emanate from my own chest. It starts as a faint flicker, like a candle flame catching, and then swells, growing brighter and stronger until it pours out of me in radiant waves. This light feels like pure potential, like unconditional acceptance. It's the dawning realization, blooming within the dreamscape: *I have always had enough. More than enough.*

With this newfound understanding, the fear doesn't vanish entirely, but it recedes, losing its sharp edges. It becomes a faint echo rather than a commanding shout. Taking a deep breath that seems to fill my lungs with starlight, I take a step forward.

Instead of falling, I float.

Gently, effortlessly, I descend into the heart of the colorful vortex. The swirling lights embrace me, not consuming, but supporting. They feel like silk and running water against my skin, vibrating with a joyful energy. As I drift deeper, I notice that the colors aren't just abstract lights; they are coalescing into tangible forms.

Glimmering fish made of liquid lapis lazuli swim past me, leaving trails of glittering dust. Flowers with petals of spun moonlight unfurl around me, releasing intoxicating perfumes that smell like forgotten memories and future joys. Crystalline structures, humming with soft melodies, grow and retract like living things.

Reaching out, tentatively at first, I touch a stream of emerald green. Instead of dissipating, it solidifies in my hand, becoming a smooth, cool jade stone, perfectly shaped. I hold it, feeling its weight, its reality. There's no cost, no depletion from the source. The vortex continues its vibrant dance, undiminished.

Emboldened, I reach again, this time towards a cascade of ruby light. It flows into my cupped hands, transforming into a cluster of perfectly ripe, impossibly sweet berries. I taste one, and the flavor explodes on my tongue – the essence of sunshine, summer rain, and pure delight.

With every interaction, the golden light within me shines brighter, resonating with the abundance surrounding me. The canyon isn't a limited resource to be cautiously approached; it's an infinite wellspring, reflecting my own inner state. The more I allow myself to receive, the more it offers. The more I trust in its boundless nature, the more apparent that boundlessness becomes.

I begin to play within the vortex, laughing as I glide through shimmering curtains of amethyst light, catching star-fragments that feel warm to the touch, listening to the harmonious symphony created by the swirling energies. The old feeling of scarcity feels distant now, like a half-forgotten tune from a different lifetime. Here, in the heart of this vibrant dream-canyon, there is only flow, only generosity, only the stunning, overwhelming reality of *enough*. More than enough. An endless, dazzling supply, mirrored by the growing light within my own heart.

I am swimming in abundance, and I realize, with a profound sense of peace, that I always have been. I just needed to open my eyes, and my hands, to receive it.
