I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of crushed moonflowers, their silver petals glowing faintly in the obsidian amphitheater. You stand at the center of a spiral mosaic depicting interlocking hearts being pierced by arrows of starlight. Twenty-three figures surround you wearing masks shaped like broken mirrors, each shard reflecting not your face, but fragments of memories you've buried: your mother's hands letting go of yours on the first day of school, the warmth of a lost friend's laugh now faded, the secret shame that curls like smoke in your ribcage.

A chime resonates from the twin moons above, and the eldest **Truthsinger** steps forward. Their mask shatters to reveal not a face, but a swirling nebula. "To drink from our shared cup," they intone, voice echoing with the weight of collapsing stars, "you must pour your unspoken fears into the Voidwell."

Before you, the mosaic parts like water, revealing a pool where liquid shadows coil hungrily. The ritual dagger in your hand thrums with forbidden energy - it doesn't require blood, but truth. You realize with growing horror that the only way to "demonstrate vulnerability" here is to physically extract your most guarded secret and let the shadows consume it.

Your deepest instinct rebels; these truths were sealed away to protect others, not yourself. But as a child's sob echoes from the well (your own, from a night you swore to forget), you grasp the terrible nuance. The ritual demands not just truth, but sacrifice of the armor surrounding it. Can you unclench your fists from the dagger to instead reach bare-handed into the well's darkness, letting shadows map your scars without taking what they protect? The Truthsingers hold their breath. Somewhere beyond the dream, your heartbeat syncs with the pulse of the Voidwell, two rhythms seeking harmony.
