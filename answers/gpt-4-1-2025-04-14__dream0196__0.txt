I am dreaming. stand backstage, shrouded in the hush of velvet curtains, as a golden hush falls over the expectant audience. The air thrums with anticipation, aglow in the theatre’s patterned light. My heart flutters like a caged bird. Beyond the curtains, the stage is set—a grand piano glistens beneath crystal lamps, exotic instruments bristle in shadow, and the scent of rosin and old wood mingles with something more elemental: electricity, promise.

A gentle hand on my shoulder—a stage manager’s whisper, “You’re on.” The world tilts. Somehow, in this dream-logic, I know my part, though I have never learned music, never danced, never sung before more than a mirror. Nevertheless, my feet move of their own accord, gliding across polished floorboards, heat pooling in my chest.

Spotlights blaze, stars born beneath the proscenium. The silence of a thousand eyes falls upon me. I tremble with unfamiliarity but, deep inside, there blossoms a wild, secret confidence, as if the universe itself is threading its wisdom through my veins.

When my fingers touch the piano keys, they spark with unlearned brilliance. Notes tumble from my hands—complex arpeggios, haunting melodies, music spun from dreams. I become a conduit. Every cell of my being vibrates with artistry, as if I’ve always been this musician. Then, when the music requires it, I rise and dance—feet sketching impossible shapes, body curving and springing as though gravity were only a suggestion. My voice joins in—soaring, new and ancient at once. The notes twist with color and shimmer, leaving trails in the air like auroras.

The audience, at first uncertain, leans forward, breathless and bewitched. Faces blur at the edges, but their eyes shine with belief—a collective enchantment. I understand: in this dream, I am not only the performer but the performance, not the virtuoso they expected, but something stranger, more wondrous—a living dream made flesh.

When the final note silvers into silence, the hush lingers. Then thunderous applause erupts, rolling over me like a wave. I bow, and the stage transforms into a garden of starlight and impossible, spiraling blooms. The curtains fall—lush, crimson—and their folds ripple like velvet oceans. I awaken, the taste of wonder still glowing on my tongue, heart echoing with impossible music.
