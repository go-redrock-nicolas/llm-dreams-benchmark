I am dreaming. I widen my eyes as a thunderous tremor shakes the cave, dislodging chunks of ancient rock from the ceiling. The earthquake intensifies, and with a resounding crash, the cave mouth collapses behind me. Dust and small pebbles rain down as I stumble forward in the darkness, my heart pounding in my chest like a jackhammer. Panic sets in as I frantically reach for my lantern, only to find its glass cracked and leaking precious oil onto the cold, damp cave floor.

The light flickers and sputters, casting eerie shadows on the rough-hewn walls. I crouch low, shielding the flame with my cupped hands, desperately trying to preserve what little light I have left. The cave's oppressive blackness presses in from all sides, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I call out, but my echo bounces back distorted, mocking me with its emptiness.

As the oil seeps into the ground, the lantern's light weakens and dims. I'm acutely aware of the countless jagged formations reaching out to snag at my clothes like skeletal fingers as I stumble deeper into the darkness. Water drips somewhere in the distance, creating an unsettling melody that echoes through the vast underground chamber. Through the filtered beam, I catch a glimpse of glittering crystals dotting the walls like stardust - a breathtakingly beautiful sight that feels both beautiful and terrifying in the overwhelming gloom.

The lamp sputters and gutters, its flame growing ever weaker. With mounting desperation, I realize I must find a new light source - and quickly. I fumble in my pack for matches, my trembling fingers making a simple task nearly impossible. The lantern gives one final gasp and expires, plunging me into total darkness. In the suffocating blackness, I hear my own ragged breathing, broken only by the steady drip of water. Now I'm forced to navigate by feel alone, inching my way forward while praying I don't tumble into a bottomless pit or find myself face-to-face with whatever creatures dwell in these lightless depths.
