I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of burning sandalwood and freshly baked bread, two fragrances that should not mingle, yet here they swirl together like dancers in an endless waltz. Above me, the sky is a tapestry of contradictions—half a blazing desert sun, half a cool, silver moonlit night, split down the middle as if the heavens themselves cannot decide which world to favor.  

Beneath my feet, the ground shifts. One moment, I walk on warm, age-worn cobblestones etched with symbols of my ancestors, the next, smooth, polished marble from a city I now call home. With each step, the textures change, never settling, never solid. Voices hum around me—some speaking in the rich, rolling cadence of my mother tongue, others in the sharp, clipped tones of a language I’ve learned to love. The words overlap, a chorus of belonging and alienation, neither fully mine nor entirely foreign.  

A marketplace materializes before me, but it is no ordinary bazaar. Stalls float midair, defying gravity, some draped in vibrant silks dyed the colors of my homeland, others sleek and metallic, glowing with neon signs in a script I recognize but do not feel in my bones. Merchants beckon—some with hands stained from henna, others with fingers adorned in minimalist rings. They offer me spices that taste like childhood, and dishes that remind me of shared laughter in a new land. I reach for both, but my hands pass through them like smoke.  

Then, the dream shifts. A river cuts through the scene, its waters split—one side rushing and clear, the other slow and dark. A bridge arches over it, but the middle is missing, leaving a gap just wide enough to make me hesitate. Do I jump? Do I turn back? The wind carries a whisper: *You don’t have to choose. You are the bridge.*  

I wake with the taste of cardamom and espresso on my tongue, the dream lingering like a half-remembered song. For a moment, I am neither here nor there—but somehow, I am both.
