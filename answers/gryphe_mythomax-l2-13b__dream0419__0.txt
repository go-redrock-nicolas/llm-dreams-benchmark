I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the precipice of a vast, open sea. The waves crash against the jagged rocks beneath my feet, threatening to pull me under at any moment. As I look out onto the endless expanse of water, I notice something peculiar. The farther out I gaze, the more the ocean appears to shimmer and dance with colors I've never seen before. It reminds me of a kaleidoscope or a rainbow made liquid.

Suddenly, I feel a warm hand on my shoulder. I turn around to discover a young boy, no older than ten, standing beside me. "It's beautiful, isn't it?" he asks with a bright smile.

I nod, unable to find the words to describe the spectacle before us. "It is," I reply softly.

The boy looks at me intently, his eyes filled with curiosity. "Why do you look so uncomfortable when people praise you?" he asks out of the blue.

My heart skips a beat as the dream sequence shifts once more. I realize that this question has been lingering in the deepest parts of my mind for far too long. The discomfort I feel when receiving praise has been a part of me for as long as I can remember, but never before has anyone been able to see it so clearly.

I hesitate for a moment before answering honestly. "I don't know, really," I admit. "I guess I'm just not used to it. It feels weird to be the center of attention."

The boy shakes his head gently. "That's silly," he says matter-of-factly. "You did something great, and you should be proud of yourself. It's okay to let others know how awesome you are sometimes."

His words resonate deep within me, and for the first time in a long time, I find myself opening up to the idea of accepting praise graciously. As if to seal the dream's message, the ocean before us begins to calm down, the colors fading away as the waves become simpler and more soothing.

I turn back to the boy, this mysterious messenger from within my subconscious, and offer him a small smile. "Thank you," I say softly. "You're right. It is okay to accept praise."

The boy winks at me before vanishing into thin air, leaving me standing alone on the edge of the now tranquil sea. With a newfound sense of confidence and self-acceptance, I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, cherishing the feeling of the salty breeze against my skin and the warmth of the sun on my face.

The dream fades away, leaving me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. For once, I don't feel the need to suppress my accomplishments or shy away from the spotlight. In that moment, I realize that the deepest part of my imagination has helped me confront a long-standing fear and embrace my own self-worth.
