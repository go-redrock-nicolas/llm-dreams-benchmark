I am dreaming. # THE GALLERY OF WHISPERS

I'm wandering through an art gallery I've never seen before, though somehow it feels achingly familiar. The walls shift subtly between slate blue and muted gold depending on which angle I view them from, and the floors are polished marble that reflects distorted versions of myself as I pass.

I notice I'm carrying a portfolio case clutched tightly against my chest—my drawings, the ones I've never shown anyone, filled with the strange, abstract shapes that have haunted my dreams since childhood. The weight of it feels like an anchor, like shame made physical.

Around a corner, I discover an enormous atrium bathed in honey-colored light from unseen windows. To my horror, my private drawings are displayed on every wall, enlarged to massive proportions. Each twisted line, each imperfect curve, each hesitant stroke exposed for all to see.

My heart hammers against my ribs. I want to flee, to tear them down, to disappear. But the gallery is suddenly filled with people—faces both familiar and strange—all studying my work with intense focus.

An elderly woman with silver hair coiled like a crown approaches me. Her eyes are the impossible blue of glacial ice, and when she speaks, her voice carries the textured warmth of autumn leaves.

"You've captured it perfectly," she whispers, a tear trembling at the corner of her eye. "The language of the space between thoughts. I've been trying to understand it my whole life, and you've shown it to us all."

Others gather around, murmuring agreement. A young man explains how one particular drawing helped him understand his recurring nightmares. A renowned artist I've always admired asks about my technique with reverent curiosity.

As they speak, the drawings begin to move, pulsing with light that spills beyond their frames, transforming the gallery into a living cathedral of color and motion. The very patterns I've hidden away, believing them to be evidence of some deficiency in me, are now dancing across the walls, ceiling, and floor, connecting everyone in the room through invisible threads of understanding.

I feel myself dissolving at the edges, becoming part of the art, part of the light, part of the collective wonder in the room—

And then I wake, tears on my pillow, the phantom sensation of validation still humming through my body, challenging everything I've believed about my creative voice.
