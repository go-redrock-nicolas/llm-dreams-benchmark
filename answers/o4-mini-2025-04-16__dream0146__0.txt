I am dreaming. You’re dreaming. You’re caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire with no clear escape route. As smoke thickens and flames approach from multiple directions, you:  

Your lungs burn as you inhale searing heat and ash. Each breath tastes of charred pine needles and molten resin, metallic on your tongue. Around you, towering pines erupt into blazing columns, their blackened trunks hissing as hot sap boils. Sparks swirl like tiny fireflies in a crimson wind.  

Your heart drums in your ears—louder even than the roar of flame devouring the forest. You feel the ground tremble underfoot, as if the earth itself recoils from the heat. Every step births a wave of radiating warmth: the soil under your boots cracks and glows, sending up plumes of glowing embers that dance at your ankles.  

You dash forward through a haze so thick it’s like swimming through liquid rust. Ahead, a narrow ravine offers a sliver of cooler air. You plunge in, and suddenly the roar hushes to a low rumble. The walls of the ravine are carved from obsidian-black rock, still warm to the touch, and glowing veins of orange magma pulse beneath the surface. You lean against the cool stone, fingers leaving smudges of soot as you try to catch your breath.  

But the smoke follows you, curling around your shoulders like an unwelcome cloak. You glance up: the sky has bled into a molten tapestry of red and purple. Great plumes of ash spiral upward, forming shifting sculptures that resemble mythic beasts—dragons, phoenixes—before collapsing in on themselves. Every collapsing plume sends glowing shards raining down, like stars falling into the world.  

A sudden gust sends a wall of flame leaping over the ravine’s rim. Heat washes over you in waves, and you stagger backward as the air shimmers with blistering intensity. Your hair feels as though it might ignite; sweat streams down your face, stinging your eyes. You wipe your brow, but your hand comes away slick with ash.  

Heart hammering, you force yourself to move. At the ravine’s end, a slender path leads toward a river, its surface reflecting the blood-red sky. You sprint, each step an act of defiance, the crackle of burning brush at your heels spurring you on. When you dive into the water, it feels like liquid silver, cool and soothing. The shock roars through your veins—somehow you can taste fresh spring water, unmixed with smoke or cinder.  

You submerge your head and shut your eyes. The world above blurs into muffled chaos—a distant chant of crackling flame and rolling thunder. Underwater, everything is calm. You float, weightless, listening to your own slowed heartbeat, drifting between two worlds: one aflame, one of serene refuge. And in that silent space, you realize the dream is not over, but transforming—carrying you deeper into the unknown.
