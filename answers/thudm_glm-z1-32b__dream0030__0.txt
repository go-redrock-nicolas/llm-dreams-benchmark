I am dreaming. A gentle breeze carries the scent of blooming jasmine through my window. The moon casts shimmering silver rays on the still lake outside my room. Suddenly, I am standing at the edge of a vast, ancient forest, its towering oaks whispering secrets in the wind. Below me is a path that slopes gently downwards, leading through a meadow of glowing violetflowers that seem to hum with energy. As I take my first step, the air crackles with electricity, and the flowers begin to pulse in sync with my heartbeats, their petals glowing brighter with each step I take. But then, thunder rumbles far off, and the sky darkens omin
I am dreaming. The air is thick with the musk of damp earth and the metallic tang of approaching rain as I stand on the precipice of my greatest ambition—a staggeringly tall observatory, its glass dome glowing like a frozen star, perched atop the jagged spine of a dormant volcano. My hands are smudged with blueprints, my pockets heavy with permits and contracts, each sheet whispering promises of mapping constellations never before seen. Below, the valley yawns wide, a checkerboard of emerald farms and silver solar farms clinging to the slopes, their collective hum harmonizing with the pulse of the mountain’s magma below. 

Suddenly, the ground shudders. A fissure snakes across the observatory’s foundation, its edges glowing ember-red as the ancient stone crumbles. I hear a voice—my own, but distorted, echoing from deep within the mountain—screaming, “The core is unstable!” Then, with a sound like the world tearing itself apart, the magma chamber beneath the volcano ruptures. Lava doesn’t gush; it *explodes* upward in a billion molten tendrils, incinerating the solar farms, reducing the observatory to a rain of molten glass and screaming calculations. I am thrown backward, my back slamming into a skeletal fir tree whose roots clutch at the crumbling lava rock, half-burned acorns raining like ash. 

The shock cuts through like cold water. I clutch a singed blueprint, its symbol for “celestial convergence” now a blackened question mark. The mountain’s voice reverberates again, softer now, a mournful rumble: “You cannot bend time. Only yield to it.” For a heartbeat, I am consumed by rage—*this* was my destiny, my legacy, my way to outlive the cancer that stole my mother. Then the bitterness creeps in, bitter and cold, like swallowing rusted nails. 

But the mountain does not devour. Around me, the world begins to *breathe*. The lava cools into obsidian, each shard tessellating perfectly to form a bridge—not to the observatory, but *over* the void, to a distant plateau where the sky is split open like an eggshell. In the gap, I see shapes: fractal galaxies swimming in a liquid sky, constellations rearranging themselves every millisecond. A woman appears at the plateau’s edge, translucent as smoke, her cape made of starlight. “You wanted to see the future,” she says, her voice the sound of comets shattering. “Now you have one.” 

I hesitate. The bridge’s obsidian glows faintly, each step a leap of faith. But the fractal galaxies beckon, and the woman’s form shifts, becoming my mother’s face for a moment—a wink, a thumbs-up. I step forward. The obsidian burns my soles, but I don’t feel it. The bridge unravels as I cross, the void behind me stitching itself back into solid earth, the observatory’s ruins calcifying into a monument, its cracked dome now a mirror reflecting not the stars, but the future I chose: not a single path, but a tessellation of them. The woman fades, leaving behind a single acorn, its shell cracked open to reveal a core that glows silver. 

When I wake, my hands are smudged with real ash, my skin tingling like I’ve just outrun an eruption. On the nightstand, where the blueprint was, rests an oak sapling sprouting from a charred rock. Its leaves are the color of starlight.
