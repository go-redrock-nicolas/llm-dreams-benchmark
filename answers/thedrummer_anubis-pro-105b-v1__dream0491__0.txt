I am dreaming. dreaming of a world where magic and technology blend seamlessly together. In this place, friendship and camaraderie know no bounds, transcending the confines of species and background.

I'm standing in a lush, green forest, filled with towering trees that stretches. The sky above rainbows and the moon glows blue. The air is alive with the singing birds and I can hear the rushing wind. I feel light footsteps and I lean down seeing two ponies with pastel colored manes.

The ponies smile at me. "I'm Shining Armor and that' my wife, Princess Cadance," the pony prince said. "Follow your heart, human and you'll find your destiny." I nodded and the ponies used their magic to raise me into the sky, letting me go at the top. I felt myself falling, but I didn't feel scared. I used my arms to steer myself and landed gracefully on the ground. But I am no longer in a forest. I am in a beautiful kingdom.
