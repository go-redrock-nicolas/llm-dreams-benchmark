I am dreaming. The forest is alive with rustling leaves...  
A storm approaches. Thunder rumbles like a lion's roar. pg4.5
I am dreaming. The forest is throbbing—a sentient, shifting entity.  

Sunlight dapples the path like liquid gold until it fractures. A horde of feathery cumulus clouds crash into the sky, their edges bleeding charcoal. Wind snakes through my hair, not with coldness, but the electric charge of ecosystems uprooting. I bend to cup a puddle formed from my own fear coalescing into rainwater, and see my reflection dissolve into the face of an ancient fir tree—a guardian whose roots drink from thesame storm I now outrun.  

Thunder manifests as something tactile: a lion’s roar vibrating through my molars. Not a distant sound, but a *presence*—a subterranean pulse that rearranges the soil beneath muddy-booted toes. Pine cones detonate midair, spilling seeds that ignite into floating fireflies. The air tastes of ozone and cinnamon bark, as if the trees themselves are seasoning the storm.  

Then the earth gives way. The forest floor peels back like a manuscript, revealing a labyrinth of bioluminescent roots. I slip through a crack in reality—a fracture in time—that extrudes into a canyon of emerald light. Here, rivers are made of mercury, and ferns gnash saw-toothed edges. A spectral stag with antlers sculpted from storm clouds charges past; its hooves leave behind constellations. I clutch a bleeding maple leaf, now a chitinous shield against hailstones that whisper prophecies in a language my bones translate: *"Follow the cracks where the sky forgets to close."*  

The storm becomes a cyclone—a maelstrom of iridescent scales and feathers. I surge upward, no longer walking but *dissolving* into the tempest. Clouds are not masses of water, but alive: hydra-headed serpents, their jaws snapping at the horizon. I laugh—a sound that births a rainbow bridge to a realm where mountains are sugar, and lakes are inkwells. A clockwork owl perched on a clocktower of ice offers me a key forged from lightning. *"Time is a wound here,"* it croons, its voice the hiss of a thousand suns dying.  

When I wake, my palms glow faintly, and the scent of petrichor lingers like a forgotten memory. But in the closet, there’s a raincoat not mine—its buttons are amber droplets, and its hem is stitched with thread that glows when it rains.
