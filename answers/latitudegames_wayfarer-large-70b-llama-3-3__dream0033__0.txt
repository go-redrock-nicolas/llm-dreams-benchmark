I am dreaming. I awaken to find myself standing at the entrance of an ancient Mayan temple, its crumbling stone walls covered in lush green vines and exotic flowers. The warm sun shines down, casting intricate patterns through the dense foliage above. As I step forward onto the weathered stone steps, I hear the distant call of tropical birds and the soft rustle of leaves in a gentle breeze.

I make my way deeper into the temple, marveling at the vibrant colors of the murals depicting battles between gods and monsters. The air grows thick with anticipation as I approach a massive stone door covered in intricate carvings of serpents and celestial bodies. With great effort, I push the door open, revealing an ornate chamber with a central altar.

As I approach the altar, my eyes are drawn to a glowing golden chalice sitting atop it. As I reach for it, I hear a rumbling sound from beneath me. The floor collapses, and I plummet downward in a shower of debris. I land hard on what appears to be a stone sarcophagus in a vast underground chamber.

Looking around, I see I'm surrounded by rows of similar sarcophagi, their lids slightly ajar. Ornate tapestries and flickering torches line the walls, casting eerie shadows. But most alarming is the limited time I have to escape, as I notice the air growing thick and stale - I must find a way out before the oxygen runs out completely. Should I try to pry open one of the sarcophagi to search for ancient treasures, or focus solely on finding an exit?
