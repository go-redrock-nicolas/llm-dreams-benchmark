I am dreaming. This is the kind of dream I would have if I didn’t have to wake up.

Warm, golden light filters through the leaves of an ancient oak tree, casting intricate patterns on the cobblestone path below.  The air smells like cinnamon and rain-soaked earth, sweet and earthy.  I am not alone.  A figure wearing a cloak of starlight materializes beside me, their eyes reflecting constellations.  They offer me a lantern with a flame that doesn’t burn—instead, it hums with the energy of every secret I’ve ever kept silent.

I grasp the lantern.  My hands shake not with fear, but with the thrill of revelation.  The figure smiles, baring teeth like polished quartz.  "Your heart is a constellation too," they say.  "Let its light spill over the path, and watch how the stones glow brighter."

We come to a clearing.  There, a circle of stones glows, and within it stands a mirror made of liquid mercury.  I stand before it, and the reflection isn’t my own—but a tapestry of every person close to me.  Each thread represents a shared vulnerability: a tear, a laugh, a moment of raw honesty.  Where threads intersect, the fabric glows brighter.

The figure steps forward and touches the mirror.  "This," they say, "is what you’ve been building all along.  Every time
