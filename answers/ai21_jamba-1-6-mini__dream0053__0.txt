I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

The dream begins in a labyrinthine building. The walls are a pale, weathered gray, and the architecture is both grandiose and unsettling—like a haunted mansion or a decrepit castle. You're trapped inside, and every hallway you explore leads to more dead ends, more dangers.

The air is thick and heavy, smelling faintly of dust and mildew. There's no natural light; the only illumination comes from flickering, erratic torches embedded in the walls, their flames casting long, grotesque shadows that skitter across the floor as you move.

As you venture deeper, you hear a distant, ominous hum. It grows louder with every step, building into a chilling, almost mechanical rhythm, like the sound of a great machine churning to life. Everywhere you look, there are moving parts: gears and pistons and grinding wheels hidden behind the walls, their metallic clangs echoing through the halls.

The walls themselves seem alive, shifting and writhing like they might collapse at any moment. Strange symbols and cogs are etched into the stone, glowing faintly in the darkness. They pulse with a faint light, almost as if they are alive, watching you, judging your every move.

The atmosphere is oppressive, and you feel a growing sense of claustrophobia. The floor beneath your feet trembles with each mechanical cycle, and the sense of being watched grows more intense with every step.

You reach a room with a vast, intricately carved door. But as you approach, the door slams shut, cutting off any retreat. The mechanical hum reaches its crescendo, and the walls surrounding you begin to close in, their stone faces shifting and contorting into grotesque, lifelike expressions of malice.

You're trapped. 

Pain erupts through your chest. The dream becomes a nightmare where you're not just fleeing danger, but feeling it with every fiber of your being. The walls are alive, and you realize the machine isn't just a structure—it's alive, and it wants to consume you.

Before you can process this revelation, the walls begin to close, and you realize with horrifying clarity that the only escape is through a door you can’t see.

The dream shifts, changing course to your reactions as you navigate the labyrinth, struggling against the clock to escape before the building's full fury consumes you.

Then, just when all hope seems lost, you spot a faint outline of a door—no, a hatch—high above you. The air shifts, no longer suffocating, as you realize you’re standing under a ceiling just within reach.

You climb, hands raw and bleeding, but you don't stop. Every movement feels like agony, but with each desperate grip, you pull closer to freedom. The harsh mechanical hum subsides, replaced by a faint sigh of relief.

Finally, your fingers close around the cold metal frame of the hatch. 

You push it open, and a rush of cool, fresh air washes over you. You emerge into a bright, open sky. The sun blinds you, its light almost painful after the dark labyrinth, but you welcome it with every cell of your being. The dream dissolves around you, leaving only the taste of freedom on your tongue.

The familiar voice you can’t quite place whispers through the fading dream, “Good morning.”

You wake up, heart racing, the memory of the dream still lingering like a ghost. You sit up, exhaling deeply, as the dream’s intensity lingers, a strange comfort in its vividness.
