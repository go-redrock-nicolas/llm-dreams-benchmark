I am dreaming. The vibrant colors, the dancing lights, the sensations that swirl within my mind are alive, pulsating with an otherworldly energy. I find myself in a realm where the boundaries of morality blur, where the hint of self-interest is as alluring as a siren's call. 

In this sweeping dreamscape, I recognize the figure of a younger woman, sensitive and delicate, with a quicksilver smile that flashes like a star in the night sky. Her eyes sparkle with genuine warmth, inviting me in, building an atmosphere of familiarity, and I feel the delicate stirrings of recognition, a hint of an unseen bridge forming between us, promising connection and understanding. 

As the dream deepens, it becomes clear that I see in her the source of greatest fear and admiration. A deep emotional resonance that has me drawn closer, making every step in her path met with effortlessness and mutual understanding, our steps so aligned that time and space become superfluous. I see and interpret this as an inviting landscape, an unusual position to exploit in any opportunity -aren't vulnerabilities always a call to care, to be of support?

The vigilance simmers down, becoming a fervent yearning in my subconscious. I deceive myself with an unsatisfactory logic: we both benefit whenever she and I truly desire to help each other. At the bottom of this instinct, I pretend a sense of solid adherence: however poor my nature, her feelings should reciprocate and resonate in kind and satisfy my inquiries; a cycle of exemptions unfolds to guide me throughout my attempts to truly seek her less-estranged reality.
