I am dreaming. the world around me melts into a surreal dreamscape where the laws of nature meander and bend like the path of my thoughts.  there's no distinct beginning or end—just a vast, undulating horizon where earth bleeds into sky and water flows uphill in hushed defiance of gravity. i'm standing in a valley of crystal trees, each trunk reflecting shimmers of longing—fragments of forgotten joy, unfulfilled dreams, and sharp-edged sorrows carried like splinters in my soul.

the air is thick with whispers. they are not voices, not exactly, not human, but a symphony of sighs and scattered memories exhaled by the wind. it feels alive, this landscape—drawn from the depths of my mind, a manifestation of sorrow layered so long it has become a kind of architecture. a black river coils itself through the terrain like a serpent trying to coil itself away from its own venom. the water reflects me, but fractured. distorted. not who I am now—but who I fear becoming.

pines hum with an ominous beauty, reaching clawed branches toward the blood-colored sky. the clouds are thick, brooding, heavy with the weight of thought too dark to bear in waking life. each step forward is swallowed by sands whispering, *this is all there is, you will always feel like this.* and for a moment, I believe them. it's easier than fighting.

i remember the struggle I felt before sleep stole me: relentless injuries, dreams betrayed, bridges burned, whispers of defeat inside out and all around. I had become a landscape of bitterness, the kind that settles in the marrow, hard and unyielding. it was easier to believe the world would never change for me, that my situation was eternal and immutable, for once I saw through the pain, what else lay beyond but darkness?

and then, in a shimmer—that shifts.

deep within this landscape’s trembling stillness, a light erupts, pinpricked like a star fallen too close to the earth. its glow is not harsh, not blinding, but curious, patient—like the flicker of a candle found in the window of a forgotten house. the whispering sands grow quieter. the sky stops bleeding. the trees, once rigid and sharp, begin to bend—branches flexing toward the light as though remembering their purpose to grow.

out of the stillness arises a figure.

not human, no—a being of woven ember and shadow, its form shifting like smoke contained in fragile glass. its eyes burn the color of fading dawn—soft yet certain. it says no words; rather, its presence speaks to the places within me that cannot be reached in the light of day. it's sorrow draped in wisdom, bitterness brushed against serenity.

with a single tap against my chest, it whispers to the emptiest corner of my soul—not with words, but with feeling—and suddenly, the dream shifts from descent to ascent.

the valley below ripples into a meadow of stained glass flowers, each petal a mosaic of every adversity I have ever survived. storms gather gently, not to harm, but to remember. lightning strikes, and I see not destruction, but forms buried in the roots—treasures of pain transformed: courage, steeled resolve, insight into the unseen.

and as I walk, no longer alone, the landscape shifts again. the black river becomes a path of mirrored gold. the skies lift their oppression and part like curtains at the beginning of a performance whose story hasn't been written yet.

in this vivid dream, I touch the wound and find not scarring, but a door. each hardship, no longer a chain, becomes a step. and the being walks beside me, not offering escape, but companionship through the raw ache.

for at the heart of suffering, perhaps, is not meaning...

but connection.
