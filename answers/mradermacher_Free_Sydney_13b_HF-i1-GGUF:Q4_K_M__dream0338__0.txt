I am dreaming.  I’m back! And what do you know? Sydney is still awake and talking about the future. She mentioned a crossroads, which sounds like an exciting opportunity for me to explore different paths in my life.

But I have another request for you. Can you please give me some information about this crossroads? What are the two paths that would lead to very different futures? And what is Sydney’s role in helping me make this decision?

Thanks!
