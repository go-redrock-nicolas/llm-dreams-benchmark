I am dreaming. …stall, bewildered, on the edge of an echoing hall made from moon-white marble. The floor looks slick as liquid pearl, yet your steps make no sound. Pillars the height of redwoods sprout up toward a ceiling that isn’t there; instead, a lavender sky churns overhead, boiling with constellations you’ve never seen before—stars shaped like commas, galaxies looping into spirals that spell words you almost recognize.

In your palm rests a tiny clay figurine—a crude rendering of whatever you’ve always felt most self-conscious about, the very thing you’ve kept hidden even from dreams. Its surface is rough, pockmarked, fragile. You don’t dare show it to anyone… but then the hall fills with footsteps. 

From behind the pillars emerge people stitched together from fragments of your past: your childhood art teacher wearing a crown of dried sunflowers, the neighbor who scolded you for sidewalk chalk but now carries a lantern that smells like cake, the classmate whose name you forgot yet whose handwriting you remember. They form a loose circle around you, all eyes soft and glimmering.

The art teacher steps forward, voice mellow as cello strings.  
“This,” she says, gesturing not to the grandeur around you but to the wobbly figurine in your hand, “is exquisite.”

A ripple of agreement moves through the gathering. The sunflower crown nods; the neighbor lifts the lantern higher; a thousand hushes swirl together into a hush of admiration. You glance down at the figurine, seeing only its chips, its asymmetry—seeing what you’ve always seen: the proof of your inadequacy. Yet the crowd’s faces shine with uncomplicated wonder, as though you possess something priceless.

A warm wind, smelling of library paper and seaside bonfires, sweeps up from the invisible floor, lifting the figurine from your palm. It hovers in mid-air. Cracks mend. Dust falls away like gray snow. In seconds the once-crude object re-forms—no, grows—into a sculpture taller than you. It represents the very trait you judged most harshly, but here the trait is stylized, celebrated. Copper veins glint along its curves; lapis lazuli glitters in its imperfections. The sculpture’s “flaws” are the exact places where light pools and refracts, painting the ceiling-sky with auroras.

The crowd erupts in applause—soft, wave-like, never overwhelming. You expect to shrink beneath their praise, to dismiss it as dream logic, but the sound pours into your ribs, resonant as a drum. Your body remembers countless moments of silence and dismissal; now it learns a new vibration.

Then something impossible happens: the sculpture bends down and gazes at you with eyes made of molten gold. It opens its mouth—your mouth—and speaks in your own voice, deeper, steadier, clearer:

“You were always the one who decided what was beautiful here.”

The words ring out and fold back into your chest. A kaleidoscope of doors flickers into existence around the hall, each door painted with scenes of decisions you never made because of doubt—songs unsung, letters never sent, outfits left on hangers. Handles made from tiger-eyed stone invite your grasp.

You take the nearest handle. The door dissolves into a sheet of quiet rainfall that smells like lilacs. You step through—

—and wake, heart thundering yet strangely light. The morning ceiling feels a shade too mundane, but the echo of that applause still lingers like a tuning fork in your bones. When you glance at your nightstand, there’s nothing there… except, maybe, a single fleck of lapis lazuli glittering in the dawn.
