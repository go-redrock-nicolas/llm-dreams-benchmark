I am dreaming. —I can feel the trembling pulse of my creation, still warm with the echo of my heartbeat. It stands before the world: a cathedral made of words and memory, every pillar and arch a confession, every stained glass window a memory I had once hidden in shadow. The critics file in—some with clipboards and grim set mouths, others murmuring behind upturned collars. Their footsteps sound like thunder in the nave of my soul.

I watch as they peer through the colored glass, pointing out the cracks I tried so hard to smooth over, the uneven seams where truth pulled too tightly against fear. Their words fall on me like icy rain: clever, dissecting, dismissive—or, far worse, indifferent. Each pronouncement flays me open, exposes the quivering path between what I wanted to say and what I managed to express. I am laid bare, my skin thin as tracing paper, all my warmth and shame and hope on display.

But then, in the hush between sharpened syllables of critique, I see a single figure standing apart—a quietly attentive stranger, their eyes shining with unspoken recognition. In their gaze, I glimpse the possibility that all this vulnerability might not be for nothing. The pain glistens, but so does pride; I have offered up my secret self to the world, and it is terrifying, yes, but it is also freedom—a chance for my truth, however raw, to kindle a spark in another’s heart.

The dream trembles at its edges: the cathedral pulses with fragile light, the critics blur into weather, and I stand steady in the midst of the storm, breathing deeply at last.
