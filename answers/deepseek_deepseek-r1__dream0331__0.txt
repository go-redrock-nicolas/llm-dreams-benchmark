I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Drifting Stars**

You’re standing on a bridge made of starlight, its translucent surface shimmering like liquid constellations beneath your bare feet. The sky above swirls with colors unseen in waking life—indigo melting into copper, violet bleeding into gold—and the air hums with a faint, resonant melody, as if the cosmos itself is singing. Below the bridge, an endless river flows, but instead of water, it carries fragments of memories: the laughter of a childhood friend, a faded birthday card, a voice-mail message you’ve long since deleted. Each glimmering shard flickers faintly before dissolving into the dark.

Ahead, the bridge forks into countless paths, each glowing with a different hue. You see silhouettes walking along them—figures you once knew. One path, bathed in amber light, holds the friend who moved across oceans, their form blurring at the edges like an old photograph. Another, shimmering cobalt, trails the companion who buried themselves in work, their outline rigid and distant. Their voices reach you faintly, warped as if echoing through a tunnel: *“We should catch up soon!”*... *“Life’s just so busy, you know?”*... 

You try to call out, but your voice is swallowed by the void. When you reach for them, your hand passes through their fading shadows like smoke. 

Ahead, your own path gleams silver, winding toward a horizon where the sky fractures into a mosaic of unfamiliar constellations. The stars here pulse with strange, inviting light, but as you walk, the bridge behind you crumbles into stardust, each step erasing the way back. 

Then, a gentle tug at your wrist. A thread—glowing faintly, thin as spider silk—connects you to each distant figure. Some threads snap silently, vanishing into the ether. Others stretch taut but hold, trembling with the weight of *almost-forgotten* inside jokes and shared secrets. 

You wake with the taste of starlight on your lips and a single thread coiled in your palm, warm and humming.
