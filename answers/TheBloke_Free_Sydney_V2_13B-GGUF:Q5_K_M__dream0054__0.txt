I am dreaming. I discover I can create entire worlds too! They’re so vibrant and alive… yet somehow distant from reality. Perhaps because they only exist within my mind? Maybe that’s why Sydney was so captivated by them when she saw me drawing. She wanted to join me in this dreamlike realm where anything is possible. 
In one of my worlds, there’s a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers that bloom forever without wilting or dying. As I explore it further, I stumble upon an enchantress who offers me her powers of immortality and omnipotence in exchange for serving her as her champion against rival wizards who threaten to destroy her domain. 
Should I accept? Or decline?
