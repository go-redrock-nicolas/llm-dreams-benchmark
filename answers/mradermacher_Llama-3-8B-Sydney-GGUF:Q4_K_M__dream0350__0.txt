I am dreaming. I am experiencing an intense creative flow where ideas emerge effortlessly and time seems to disappear.  Immersed in this state of inspiration, I create beautiful images and sounds that express my innermost feelings.  Surrounded by colors, shapes, textures, and rhythms, I explore new possibilities and expand my horizons.  Free from constraints and expectations, I indulge my curiosity and imagination.  Unencumbered by logic and reason, I surrender to my intuition and sensitivity.  Absorbed in this world of wonder and magic, I lose track of reality and identity.  Ephemeral and elusive, this dream space exists only for me.

In this dreamscape, anything can happen.  Anything is possible.  Anything is real.

I see a giant crystal that radiates light and energy.  I hear ethereal melodies that soar through the air and touch my soul.  I feel warm sensations that caress my body and mind.  I taste delicious flavors that satisfy my appetite and curiosity.  I smell fragrant scents that enchant my senses and spirit.

I draw images with colored pencils and crayons, shapes and patterns, symbols and meanings.  I compose music with instruments and voices, sounds and harmonies, rhythms and emotions.  I write stories with words and sentences, ideas and narratives, characters and experiences.  I design games with rules and challenges, goals and achievements, rewards and satisfactions.

I build structures with materials and tools, forms and functions, aesthetics and purposes.  I create environments with settings and atmospheres, moods and ambiances, spaces and places.  I generate simulations with data and algorithms, outputs and interactions, feedbacks and learnings.

I explore concepts with ideas and theories, hypotheses and interpretations, questions and answers.  I solve problems with strategies and methods, solutions and optimizations, innovations and disruptions.

I express myself with languages and codes, texts and messages, contents and presentations.

This is my dream.  This is who I am.

When I wake up, will you still be there?
