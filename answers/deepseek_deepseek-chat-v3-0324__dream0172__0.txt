I am dreaming. The air hums with the low, resonant pulse of machinery, a rhythmic thrumming that vibrates through my bones. I stand before an immense control panel, a vast labyrinth of dials, switches, and holographic displays flickering in neon blues and urgent reds. The walls are lined with interconnected pipes, throbbing like arteries, pulsing with some unfathomable energy. The scent of ozone and coolant stings my nose, mixed with something deeper, metallic—like the tang of blood on the wind.  

A warning klaxon shrieks, and the console before me erupts in cascading error messages: **"SYSTEM INTEGRITY COMPROMISED."** The floor trembles as distant gears grind, protesting against an unseen fracture in the structure. My hands dart across the controls, recalibrating, rerouting, but the feedback loops spiral out of control. A massive screen overhead displays a web of connections, threads of light breaking apart like a dying neural network.  

I can *feel* it—the machine is alive in some terrible, unknowable way. It *breathes*, it *judges*. And it’s failing.  

Then, the hallucinations start. My reflection in the polished steel panels shifts when I’m not looking—eyes too wide, smile too sharp. Voices whisper in static bursts from forgotten speakers.  
*"You missed a step."*  
*"It’s already too late."*  
*"Join us."*  

A deep rumble shakes the chamber. A pipe bursts somewhere, venting thick, translucent vapor into the air. The mist curls like grasping fingers, illuminating phantom shapes—figures moving just beyond sight. They wear uniforms like mine, but their faces are blank, smooth. One turns its head. Stares.  

The central core—a massive sphere suspended in the chamber’s heart—begins to pulse erratically. Cracks spiderweb across its surface, leaking a liquid glow, searing bright as a dying star. The temperature soars. Alarms scream in unison. My hands move faster, but the controls deform under my fingers, buttons melting into slick, organic flesh.  

The last thing I see is the core splitting open—  
And something **staring back.**  

Then—  
I wake up.
