I am dreaming. The dream starts in a vast, open meadow under a sky that swirls with colors—neon pinks, electric blues, and streaks of gold. The grass beneath my feet is luminescent, glowing like embers in the dark. There’s a gentle breeze that carries the scent of rain and wild lavender, a smell that feels ancient yet familiar. 

As I walk, the ground softly hums, each step sending ripples of light outward. In the distance stands a massive tree, its trunk twisting upwards in impossible spirals before branching into a canopy so dense it casts a kaleidoscopic shadow. Its leaves are like stained glass, shifting hues with every gust of wind. Something about the tree feels alive in a way that defies words. It seems to breathe, its pulsations synced to the rhythm of my heartbeat.

Approaching it, I notice small, glowing creatures fluttering around the branches—they resemble moths but with iridescent scales that shimmer like liquid metal. They alight on my palms when I extend my hand, their touch cool but comforting. One lands on my shoulder and morphs into a tiny, humanoid figure with eyes like twin supernovas. It speaks without sound, its voice resonating in my mind: “The tree remembers everything you’ve ever forgotten. Its roots are threads to other realms.”

Just as I’m about to step closer, I trip over an unseen root, sprawling onto the glowing grass. My cheeks flush as I notice the creatures’ glowing forms dim slightly. The internal voice hisses, **“Clumsy. You always ruin things.”**

The humanoid moth tilts its head, and instead of condemnation, warmth floods the space between us. “You think mistakes fracture reality?” it murmurs. “No—each stumble weaves new paths through the branches of possibility. The tree never stops growing.” 

As I rise, the ground where I fell now sprouts a crystalline vine, its edges sharp yet harmless, curling into intricate patterns that spell out *“Begin again.”* The voice tries to interject, but the air thrums with a countersong: **“You are not mistakes. You are becoming.”**

The tree’s canopy erupts into a shower of light, forming a bridge that arcs toward an endless horizon. The moth gestures toward it. “Cross it when you’re ready,” it says, “but know this: every misstep is a seed for something unexpected.”

Before leaving, the moth dissolves into a shower of sparks that cling to my skin like temporary tattoos of starlight. The sky fades from wild colors to deep indigo, and the meadow stretches onward, now dotted with luminous spheres rising like liberated thoughts. Each holds a fragment of memory or a glimpse of a life unlived. 

The self-critical voice tries again to seep back in, but the moth’s words linger like a shield. I step onto the bridge, its surface a lattice of interconnected threads, each humming with the voices of ancestors and possibilities. With every step, the threads thicken, glowing brighter as my heartbeat syncs with the tree’s pulse.

Mid-stride, doubt still tugs—*What if I fail?*—but the answer comes from within me now, strong and sure: *Begin again.* The bridge sways gently, supporting me, as the spheres drift by, whispering encouragement in constellations of light.

The horizon resolves into a door framed by the tree’s roots. It’s massive, crafted from polished obsidian and etched with constellations that spin independently. The keyhole is a single eye socket, and when I touch it, the moth’s starlight tattoos flare. The door creaks open, revealing a vast library where books float, their pages alive with stories yet untold. Each shelf is a river of light, and there’s a creature here—a panther with feathers instead of fur—its gaze cradling me in amber.

“Your journey is not about perfection,” it intones, voice like wind through reeds, “but participation. Every flaw is a fingerprint in the clay of existence.” The books cluster around, their covers opening to show words forming into butterflies that land on my fingertips, spelling out **forgiveness**, **courage**, and **begin again**.

I stay in that library forever, or perhaps just a minute, until I wake with the taste of lavender on my tongue and the faint glow of star tattoos still prickling my skin. The voice lingers, but now it’s quieter, outshone by the echo of: *Begin again.*
