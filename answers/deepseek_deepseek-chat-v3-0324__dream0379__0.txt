I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming night-blooming cereus, their white petals glowing faintly in the moonlight. As I walk along a cobbled path lined with flickering lanterns carved from hollowed-out gourds, I become acutely aware of the weight pressing on my chest—not physical, but a deep, gnawing uncertainty. 

Ahead, the path forks into three, each leading into distinctly different landscapes. The left trail disappears into a dense forest where fireflies pulse in erratic patterns, like indecipherable Morse code. The middle path ascends a hill crowned by an imposing clock tower, its hands spinning wildly, as if time itself is unraveling. The right path descends into a sunlit meadow filled with people—some familiar, some strangers—all watching me expectantly, waiting for my choice.

My breath catches when I realize what’s happening. I used to stride forward without hesitation, trusting my instincts to guide me. But now, I find myself turning to the faces in the meadow, searching their eyes for approval or direction. An old woman with silver hair and knowing eyes steps forward, holding out a bowl of water—its surface rippling even though the air is still. "Look deeper," she whispers. 

As I peer into the bowl, the reflection shifts—it’s not my present self staring back, but versions of me from past moments where I made choices with unshakable certainty. Building a sandcastle just right as a child, painting the sky purple because it felt truer than blue, walking away from an opportunity that didn’t align with my spirit. 

A breeze stirs, and the visions dissolve. The bowl tilts, spilling water that evaporates before it touches the ground. The old woman’s voice lingers, blending with the hum of the night. "You already know the steps. Why ask for the map?" 

A drumming sound starts, rhythmic and sure—my own heartbeat, growing louder. Just as I turn back to the paths, the clock tower stops spinning, the fireflies sync their pulses, and the meadow crowd bows their heads. The choice was never theirs. It was always mine. 

And with that, the dream begins to dissolve—but not before I feel something solid settle inside me, familiar and forgotten, like an old key slipping back into its lock.
