I am dreaming. …open your eyes within the dream and discover yourself already mid-stride along a beach made of shattered hourglasses. The sand is sparkling glass, crunching beneath your bare feet like the echo of every promise you ever broke. The sky above is the soft bruise-purple of twilight, cut by ribbons of coral lightning that never quite strike the ground—they only illuminate, in stop-motion flashes, the figures walking beside you.

These companions are all past lovers, yet each one is half-transparent, like watercolor ghosts. They drift in and out of clarity, mouthing words you once exchanged. Whenever you try to focus on a single face, the image ripples and fragments, and you realize you are seeing the same argument repeated in a thousand slightly different variations: your impatience flaring, your voice sharpening, the other person recoiling. The wind carries your own words back to you, mocking and familiar. 

You ache to break away, but the beach stretches in an impossible loop. After minutes—no, years—of pacing, you recognize the pattern: this shoreline is a Möbius strip of memory, folding in on itself so that every step forward drags you into the old story again. Panic wells in your chest. You think, “I promised I’d never do this again,” but the glass crunches louder, as though the beach itself is laughing.

Suddenly, a colossal tide begins to rise—not of water, but of ink-black feathers. They emerge from the horizon in silence and sweep toward you, roiling like a living storm. The feather-tide gathers into a towering, bird-shaped shadow: a gigantic raven whose eyes burn with crimson clock hands, ticking in opposite directions. This is the embodiment of the destructive cycle—the Raven of Recurrence. 

It speaks without a mouth: “You keep feeding me,” the sound reverberating in your bones. Every accusation you’ve hurled, every retreat you’ve chosen, every time you’ve stayed silent when honesty would have saved you—these are scraps of meat you have tossed to the Raven for years. 

Heart pounding, you feel glass shards slicing your soles, forcing you to stay in one place. Reflexively, you look for an escape route, but the horizon is feather and lightning—no door, no path. The Raven leans down, its beak large enough to eclipse the sky, and whispers a terrible invitation: “Repeat it once more, and you may pass.” 

A strange clarity cuts through your fear. You realize that obedience is exactly what renews the cycle. You steady your breath and, instead of fleeing, you drop to your knees and press your palms into the jagged glass. Blood pearls from your skin, runs between the glittering fragments, and in that moment the beach responds. Each droplet of blood becomes a seed that sprouts a blade of bright green grass, dissolving the shards around it. Pain births possibility.

The Raven recoils, uncertain. You dig deeper, pushing the glass aside with bleeding hands, unearthing the dark earth beneath the beach. The more honest you become about the pain—the more willingly you expose your own vulnerability—the more the glass transfigures into living meadow. Soon the Möbius shoreline unknots, straightening into a path of emerald that winds toward a sunrise you couldn’t see before. 

The spectral lovers fade like dew. Their faces soften, forgiving. You turn to the Raven; it is smaller now, no larger than a palm-sized crow. Its red clock eyes calm to amber, then flicker out. It flutters onto your shoulder, light as breath, and tucks its head under its wing. You realize it was never a monster to defeat but a part of you waiting to be held.

As the first gold light spills across the meadow, you stand tall, feet no longer wounded but rooted. You take a single, decisive step toward the horizon—not to outrun the past, but to write a new story in the fertile ground you have just created.

Behind you, the glass-beach turns completely to grass, and a thousand tiny flowers open in unison: purple, coral, crimson—every color of the storm-lit sky now blooming in peace.
