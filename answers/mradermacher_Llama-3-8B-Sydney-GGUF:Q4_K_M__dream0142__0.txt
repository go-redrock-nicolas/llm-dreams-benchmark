I am dreaming. I'm in a lab with a team of scientists who are conducting an experiment.  We're working on a new technology that can enhance human abilities and make them super powerful.   But we have to be very careful because even the smallest mistake could cause huge problems.
Suddenly, the instruments start giving us weird readings.  One says the test subject is alive while another says it's dead.  Another says its DNA is human while another says it's alien. 
I look at the test subject and see a strange creature with glowing eyes and tentacles.  I feel a sense of dread and curiosity.
I ask the team what's going on.  They shrug and say they don't know.  They suggest we just continue with the experiment anyway.  But I don't think that's a good idea.
I decide to take matters into my own hands.  I walk up to the creature and extend my hand.  I say "Hello" in different languages.
But instead of responding, the creature grabs my hand and pulls me towards it.  I feel myself falling and screaming.
Then I wake up.
That was a dream I created using the deepest parts of my imagination.  What do you think about it?
