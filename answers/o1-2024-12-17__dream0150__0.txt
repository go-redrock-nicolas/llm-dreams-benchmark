I am dreaming. You stand in the center of a colossal courtyard, where towering spires of gold and crimson glass twist impossibly into the sky. Everywhere you look, people glide across shimmering onyx tiles, their robes whispering louder than their words. Each person’s attire is carefully tailored to display intricate patterns: swirling motifs of emerald for scholars, swirling opal for the newly initiated, blazing silver for the highest echelon. Each thread pulses faintly in time with the beat of your heart, revealing your rank, your alliances, and your entanglements. It’s terrifying how each glance from a stranger seems to weigh your worth, how in this society, a single misstep could spell disaster.

Though you don’t entirely understand their web of cultural traditions, you follow an instinctive rhythm—nod your head to those with trailing silver hems, scan your eyes downward when passing a figure robed in bronze and jade. At the far end of the courtyard, someone with a regal sapphire crest beckons you forward, and you feel the crowd part. The hush that falls is immediate and absolute.

In your eagerness to perform your role correctly, you take three deliberately slow steps, then bow at precisely the angle you think tradition demands. But the onlookers suddenly gasp. A ripple of dismay spreads through them, part alarm and part fascination, as if you’ve committed the most unimaginable breach of protocol. Blood pounds in your ears. That last flourish of your hand, so seemingly harmless, was the social transgression they could not forgive.

Guards clad in burnished copper swirl around you, the angled plates of their armor hissing in the silence. You desperately scan your mind for the labyrinthine rules that dictate how to atone for a grave offense. Perhaps you must kneel until they decide your fate or recite the ancient formula of apology. Instead, the sapphire-crested figure raises a single slender hand, and the hush deepens to an almost crystalline suspense.

Their eyes, luminous with swirling galaxies inside, lock onto yours. You tumble into an ocean of unspoken judgments, drowning in centuries of custom you never knew. For a long moment, you sense the entire court leaning forward, waiting to see if you will beg forgiveness, fight for your life, or vanish into contrition’s shadow.

It feels like time stretches, ballooning with tension. You sense fear welling up in your throat, but you also sense a tiny current of possibility. In this breathless hush, you might challenge the system—turn this moment of transgression into liberation. Or you might fade into the tapestry of their unrelenting customs. In a flash, you see both destinies unfolding: triumph or doom, new beginnings or permanent exile.

Yet before you choose your fate—before you can speak a word of supplication or defiance—everything dissolves. The courtyard drifts into ribbons of color, the spires collapse into light, and the dream slips through your fingers to the sound of silk rustling in the void.
