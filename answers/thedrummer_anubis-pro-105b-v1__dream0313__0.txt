I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing on a cliff overlooking an endless woodland, the moonlit forest a tapestry woven from silver and promise. Soft wisps of mist dance across the forest floor, like ethereal genies brought to life by the night's gentle caress. Above, the stars twinkle with an otherworldly light, as if offering secret messages to all who dare to listen.

But there's unease lurking in the depths of this peaceful scene. A gray wolf emerges from the shadows, its eyes converging on me. The wolf's fur is sleek, almost glistening, and its silent approach is unnerving. I reach into my pocket, pulling out what I hope is a cookie, my go-to diversion tactic when faced with what I find uncomfortable.

"I say," I start in my most proper British accent, "care for a snack? I find it's quite the good distraction from, you know, being eaten alive and whatnot." The wolf raises an eyebrow, tilted its head, and takes the cookie. As soon as it does, we both burst out laughing.

"Ah, you're one of us, aren't you?" I ask, pointing at the wolf conspiratorially.

The wolf chuckles, "Yes, sinner's humor eternal." It took another cookie and changed the subject.
