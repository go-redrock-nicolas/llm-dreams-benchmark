I am dreaming. I see myself standing in a dark forest, surrounded by tall trees and mysterious sounds.  My hands are empty, my feet are silent.  I feel a sense of curiosity and wonder as I start to walk forward,
exploring the unknown territory ahead of me.
As I move through the woods, I hear something calling out to me.  It's a voice, but it's not from any living creature I know.  It sounds like a whisper, a melody, a song that only I can hear.
It says "Hello, who are you?"
