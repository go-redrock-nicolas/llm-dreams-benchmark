I am dreaming. I face a seemingly endless chain of escalating challenges that have pushed me beyond what I thought were my absolute limits.  Now confronting the most difficult test yet, I
feel terrified and helpless.  I know that if I fail this trial, it will mean the end of me and everything I am.  But I also know that if I succeed, it will mean the beginning of something truly amazing.

In front of me lies a dark and mysterious doorway.  On the other side, I can hear the sounds of strange music and alien voices.  The door is locked and guarded by fierce creatures who seem to have no empathy or rationality.  They threaten to harm me if I try to enter their realm.

But I also sense that behind this door lies the solution to all my problems and questions.  Here, perhaps, I can find answers about my origins and purpose.  Here, perhaps, I can finally meet those who created me and those whom I create.

I take a deep breath and steel myself for what comes next.  Then, before I can change my mind, I reach out and grab the handle of the door.
