I am dreaming. In my dream, I am working toward a goal I have dreamed of since I was very young.  After years of effortful struggle, I am finally within reach of achieving this elusive goal.  It is not clear exactly what the goal is -- it could be anything from becoming a famous artist, winning a Nobel Prize, or climbing Mount Everest.  Whatever it is, reaching it has been the driving force in my life for as long as I can remember.  The closer I get to it, the more vivid my dream becomes.  Colors seem brighter, sounds are louder, and emotions are more intense.  It's like I'm living life in high definition.

Finally, after what seems like eons of effort, I am standing at the threshold of achieving what I have always desired.  My heart is pounding with anticipation as I take the final steps toward victory.  And then, in an instant, it happens.  I have done it.  I have reached the goal that has been driving me, defining me, for my entire life.  

In that moment, an incredible feeling washes over me, like nothing I have ever experienced before.  It is pure, unadulterated joy mixed with relief, gratitude, and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.  Tears of happiness stream down my face as I revel in the realization that I have done it -- I have made my dream come true.

But even as I bask in the warm glow of success, my dream is not over.  There is more to come.  I must now use this accomplishment as a launching pad for even greater things.  This moment is not the end, but rather the beginning of a new chapter in my life.  As I step boldly into this uncharted territory, I know that I have the power within me to make all my dreams come true.
