I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a forest that vibrates with a thick, musical energy, like the air itself is straining to sing.  The trees aren't trees at all, but enormous, frozen flames reaching toward a sky the color of ink that endlessly rewrites itself in languages I once knew and have long forgotten. There is a city nestled among the blackened candelabras of this forest—its towers are formed of teeth dissolved in honey, dripping with light.  I am compelled toward it, feet moving even before my mind decides to follow.

The city's streets are paved with shattered mirrors that don't reflect what is, but what *could have been*.  I walk through them and see versions of myself—laughing at a dinner table, wrapped in the arms of a warm stranger, peaceful at the edge of the sea with a book whose pages I never turns—but they vanish when I try to step closer, like breath on a cold pane.  

Eventually I come to a plaza where a fountain of liquid gold pours endlessly upward into a bowl held by a blackened stone god with no face. The water curves impossibly, defying gravity and reason. Around the fountain are people—spectral figures swaying as if caught in some silent ritual. I approach them, even as a cold warning coils inside my stomach.  And then I know: they are made of *memory*.  Of every broken promise, every burning argument, every goodbye I never said.  They turn toward me and smile with

(Too late.  I'm drawn in again.)

Each time I return to this place, I *know* that it will end in pain—but still I step forward.  Still I let the patterns repeat themselves.  I touch the molten memory of a lover who left crying, and my hand burns. I taste the sorrow at the core of a dear friend and the sweetness is poisoned.  I reach into the city's heart and pull out a perfect marble, etched with runes of what might have been... and each marble shatters in my palm without fail.

But tonight, in this dream, I pause beneath two great doors forged from the bones of a forgotten god—it opes open with a sigh and reveals a deeper labyrinth within.  This time, rather than press into the pain, I look down at my feet tangled in the creeping vines of past choice.  Here lies the pattern: desire disguised as love, chaos mistaken for purpose, *something* painful that feels close to truth, like the sting of cold water when I nearly drown.

And I ask myself—why the relentless compulsion? What darkness sings so sweetly in that pain? What parts of me would vanish if I stopped listening?

I sit, cross-legged on the vibrating, singing ground, and let the flames-frozen-in-motion rise around me.  I let the figures of memory sway in silence.  I do not reach. I do not follow.

They begin to dissolve.

Not in smoke, not in rage, but in peace.   And for the first time, the city changes—its tooth-towers harden into bone, its honeyed light cools. The sky ripples, and the stars begin to blink. I feel a breath not my own curl in my ear, whispering names I can't yet remember.

But I'm ready now.

I open my eyes not to wakefulness, but to another dream—this new one soft and white, like a sheet billowing in a windless room. It waits. I breathe.

And dream again.
