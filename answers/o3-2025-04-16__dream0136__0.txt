I am dreaming. I am dreamingand as dreams do, this one begins mid-breath.

Someone shakes my shoulders backstage, the corridor lit by jittery crimson bulbs that pulse like a panicked heartbeat. “They’re gone under,” the stage manager hisses, meaning the legendary Starling Vérité, the voice that can shatter glass and mend hearts. One slip of fever and the burden topples onto me, the understudy no one even bothered to rehearse. A thousand seats hum on the other side of the velvet dam; every murmur feels like a tide testing the gates.

Costumers descend like tropical birds, sewing me into midnight silk as if cocooning a moth they hope might bluff itself into becoming a butterfly. They dust my eyelids with comet powder, press a microphone into my palm—cold, oddly alive, a stethoscope for the soul. Somewhere a gong booms. The overture has started without me.

The assistant director recites instructions I cannot hear; his words liquefy, drip down the walls, and puddle at my feet. Panic should root me, yet a strange wind lifts my rib cage. I step through the slit in the curtains.

Light detonates. Golden spotlights braid themselves into a throne around me. The crowd is a living topography—hills of faces whose eyes glitter like distant campfires. I open my mouth to confess I know nothing, but instead a note unfurls, pure and ribbon-long, a sound pulled from the marrow of some ancient bird. It is not my voice yet entirely mine.

A hush ripples outward, wider than any auditorium. Strings from the orchestra float up and orbit me; trumpets shed petals instead of notes; the drummer’s sticks leave comet tails. With every phrase I invent, the backdrop obeys: sing of oceans, and waves tumble across the stage; whisper of midnight, and constellations stamp themselves on the ceiling. I ride a melody I have never studied yet somehow remember, as though I’m translating the secret language of my own pulse.

Fear evaporates, replaced by a lucid exhilaration—as if the dream itself auditions for my approval. I hit the impossible high note Starling was famed for, and the audience collectively inhales, a single colossal lung. Silence, then thunder: applause roars so loudly the balconies tremble like leaves in a storm. Roses surge toward the stage in slow motion, their petals turning into glowing script that spells one word: YES.

I bow, and gravity surrenders. The stage floor peels away; I am drifting above it all, buoyed on ovations that feel like warm rain. For an instant I see myself—a lone figure wrapped in darkness and starlight, singing a universe into being—and I understand that preparedness is only one river; trust in wonder is the other.

The curtain falls with the softness of eyelids closing. Applause fades to the hush of sheets at dawn. I wake clutching invisible roses, the ghost of music still echoing in my chest like a secret promise that I, too, might always be ready when the light unexpectedly finds me.
