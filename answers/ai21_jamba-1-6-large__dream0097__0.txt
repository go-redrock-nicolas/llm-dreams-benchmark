I am dreaming. The dream becomes vivid, a whirlwind of sights and sounds snapping into focus with stunning clarity. I stand amidst a crowd in the heart of a bustling city, a place so familiar it feels like home yet alien with its towering skyscrapers kissing the clouds. The air is thick with tension, an electric charge bouncing between the throngs of people who are walking, talking, and laughing. The sun casts golden beams through the canyon of steel and glass, creating pockets of warmth amidst the concrete jungle.

Out of nowhere, a deafening BOOM shatters the peace. It's as if the world itself has cracked open. At first, I think it's thunder, but the sky remains clear, the sun unyielding. Then comes a trembling in the ground, subtle at first, like the soft purring of a giant cat. Within seconds, it grows into a violent shaking that sends people stumbling into one another. The buildings around me sway dangerously, their windows rattling like teeth in a skull.

Chaos erupts, spreading faster than the shockwaves. Screams pierce the air, mingling with the cacophony of car alarms and the shattering of glass. People run blindly, crashing into one another in a desperate bid for safety. It's as though the universe has been flipped on its axis, and gravity itself seems to falter, pulling everything toward collapse.

And then, as quickly as the shaking began, it stops. The sudden stillness is almost worse than the chaos. Dust hangs heavy in the air, swirling in the sunlight, a grim veil hiding the devastation. I look around, disoriented, my heart pounding so hard it feels like it might burst through my chest. The once-proud buildings now lean at unnatural angles, their facades crumbled and broken. Cars lie overturned, their frames twisted and smoking. There's an acrid smell, a mixture of dust, smoke, and something sharp and chemical that stings my nose.

In the midst of all this, a strange sensation washes over me—like a warm, electric current coursing through my veins. It's as though every nerve ending in my body has been awakened, heightened. My vision becomes sharper, cutting through the dust and debris with unnatural clarity. Sounds, even the softest whimpers and the faint drip of water from a broken pipe, reach my ears with crystal precision. Time seems to slow around me, allowing me to process every detail in hyper-real clarity.

And then, I feel it—an overwhelming urge, a knowing deep within me. I am meant to move, to act. My feet carry me forward without hesitation, as though guided by some unseen force. I weave through the wreckage with impossible precision, guided by a sixth sense that seems to map out the safest path amidst the destruction. I find people trapped beneath rubble, cough
