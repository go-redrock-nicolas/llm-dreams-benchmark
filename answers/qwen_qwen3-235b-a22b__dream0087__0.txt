I am dreaming. You’re standing in a vast, circular chamber that seems to have no ceiling—only a swirling sky of indigo and molten gold, as if the heavens themselves are holding their breath. The walls are made of ancient stone, etched with runes that glow faintly, pulsing like heartbeats. A long table carved from a single slab of obsidian dominates the room, its surface cracked down the middle, as though split by some primordial force. Around it sit the family members, their faces half-lit by flickering sconces that burn with blue flame. Each person radiates a different elemental energy: one smolders with volcanic heat, another drips with the chill of a subterranean river, a third crackles with the static of a stormfront. Their voices are already sharp, slicing through the air like shards of glass.  

The dispute is ancient, older than any of them remember. It began with a betrayal whispered in a language now lost to time, a theft of something intangible—pride, perhaps, or a promise. Generations have layered their grievances atop it like sediment, until the original wound is buried so deep it festers invisibly. Now, they argue not just about the past, but about the shape of memory itself. One insists the betrayal happened in winter, another swears it was summer; one claims the thief wore a crown of thorns, another says it was a wreath of roses. The truth is a prism, refracting into contradictions.  

As tensions escalate, the room begins to warp. The runes on the walls flare crimson, then black, and the air thickens with the scent of burning cedar and iron. The obsidian table bleeds a viscous silver liquid that pools into a mirror, reflecting not their faces, but scenes from the past—except each reflection is different. In one, a child is abandoned in a snowstorm; in another, the same child walks willingly into the cold. The family members scream over one another, pointing at the mirror, their voices echoing as if multiplied by a thousand ancestors.  

You rise from your seat, your own form shifting—now a towering figure cloaked in shadows, now a child clutching a lantern that emits no light. You speak, but your words are not words at all; they’re sensations. A memory of a mother’s lullaby hummed in a language none of them know. A vision of the family’s first home, its walls made of woven branches that wept sap like tears. The room shudders. The elemental energies flicker, uncertain.  

Then, from the cracked center of the table, a vine erupts—twisting, thorned, bearing flowers that bloom and wither in seconds. It coils around each person’s wrist, binding them in a living chain. The vine whispers in their ears, feeding them fragments of the other’s memories: a moment of forgiveness never spoken, a secret act of protection mistaken for indifference. The volcanic one begins to weep molten tears that hiss as they hit the silver pool. The icy one’s hands tremble, frost creeping up their arms like ivy.  

The dispute isn’t resolved. It cannot be. But the room softens. The sky above clears to a bruised twilight, and the runes dim to a contemplative green. The family sits in a silence thick with ambiguity, their bonds frayed but unbroken. You feel yourself dissolving, your form unraveling into mist, as the dream shifts toward its inevitable end.  

When you wake, your chest aches with the weight of a thousand unspoken apologies.
