I am dreaming. I find myself standing at my desk in a familiar office that suddenly feels strange. The computer before me flickers with symbols I once understood but now appear as indecipherable hieroglyphs. My fingers hover over the keyboard, muscle memory failing me for the first time in decades. Around me, colleagues move with confident purpose, manipulating holographic interfaces with casual gestures while my outdated terminal sits like a museum piece.

Yesterday, I was the authority everyone consulted. Today, neural implants have been distributed company-wide—except to me, who declined out of principle or perhaps fear. The knowledge I spent twenty years accumulating now resides in everyone's cortex, downloadable in seconds.

The air feels thick with a mixture of embarrassment and panic as I fumble through tasks that once defined my expertise. A young intern approaches, eyes glowing with subtle interface indicators, offering assistance with genuine kindness that somehow stings worse than mockery would.

"It's just different pathways to the same destination," she says, her fingers dancing through air as she solves in moments what would have been my day's achievement.

In the bathroom mirror, I see my reflection ripple like disturbed water. My identity—so long defined by what I know and what I can do—dissolves before me. Who am I when the skills that made me valuable are universally accessible?

The office transforms around me, walls breathing inward then expanding outward. I find myself in a garden I somehow planted years ago but forgotten. Plants I cannot name bloom with colors I cannot describe. I realize with startling clarity that my hands still remember how to nurture growth, even when my mind cannot categorize it.

A butterfly lands on my finger, its wings displaying the same indecipherable symbols from my computer screen. But here, understanding them doesn't matter—witnessing their beauty does.

I wake with tears and revelation mingling on my face, understanding that adaptation isn't abandonment of self, but discovery of what remains when the temporary is stripped away.
