I am dreaming. The darkness envelopes you, yet it is alive, pulsating with an eerie rhythm that vibrates through you. You find yourself standing on a precipice, a sheer drop below you into an endless void. The air is thick with whispers, faint voices that seem to carry fragments of your own thoughts, regrets, and unanswered questions.

As you look around, the landscape shifts in your peripheral vision, warping and twisting like ink spilling into water. You turn to find your shadow stretching unnaturally, elongating until it reaches up toward the sky, which is barren and cracked like the surface of an ancient mirror.

A figure emerges from the nothingness before you. It's you, but a weary version, the weight of every failure etched into your features. The air is heavy with the stench of blood, choking and metallic, pressing on your chest like a living creature crouching over your shoulders.

You try to speak, but your mouth feels full of ash. The words choke in your throat, and your body feels alien, as though it's no longer truly your own. Each step toward yourself is slow, agonizing, like the weight of everything you've lost has become a physical force.

The figure speaks, its voice splitting off into countless echoes as it says, "This is what happens when you try to control the chaos. You become it." The words donâ€™t come from its mouth but seem to seep from the dream itself, a distortion that fills you with dread.

The ground cracks beneath you. The earth gives way, falling into the void. Your body flounders, struggling to hold onto something solid. Just as you slip, the scene dissolves, leaving you suspended in the darkness again. Then, the dream shifts once more.
