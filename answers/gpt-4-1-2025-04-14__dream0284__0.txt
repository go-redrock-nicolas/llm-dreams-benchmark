I am dreaming. As the event approaches, you find yourself standing in front of a grand, ancient mirror carved from wood so old it seems to hum with forgotten stories. Shadows curl in the corners of the glass, distorting your reflection into a dozen anxious, shifting versions of yourself. The air is thick with anticipation, pressing against your lungs with every breath.

The world blurs and you are transported to the gathering—a sprawling mansion suspended impossibly on the edge of a cliff, where the moon hangs swollen and watchful above. The walls pulse with opulent, golden light, but the corridors twist and wind in ways that make no rational sense. Laughter echoes from around unseen corners, layered and overlapping so it sounds both welcoming and conspiratorial.

Your feet carry you, heavy and treacherous, into a ballroom shimmering with unfamiliar faces. Everyone is draped in costumes of gossamer and mist; their eyes gleam like twin lanterns through delicate masks, and their voices warp into melodic ripples. Every time you try to approach a group, the floor beneath your feet tilts, subtly sliding you away, your words caught in your throat like moths fluttering desperately against glass.

Suddenly, you find a gilded staircase spiraling upward, beckoning you. Driven by desperation for escape—or perhaps hope for relief—you ascend, each step sighing under your weight. At the top, there is a door of midnight blue set with a single silver star. You reach for the handle, trembling. As you open it, the entire anxiety-soaked mansion seems to inhale.

You step into a quiet, moonlit garden where ancient willows bow protectively overhead and fireflies blink in gentle patterns. The anxiety doesn’t vanish, but it softens, ebbing away with the breeze. Here, the whisper of leaves is as gentle and familiar as the rhythm of your own heart. You kneel and cup a small pool of starlight in your hands, watching your restless reflection dance and then dissolve.

The party fades to memory, and the relief washes over you, gentle and whole—revealing an oasis you shaped from the deepest corridors of your hope and fear.
