I am dreaming. The dream begins in a forest of blackened trees, their bark peeling like scorched parchment. The air is thick with the scent of wet ash, and the ground squelches beneath your feet as if the earth itself is weeping. You walk, not by choice, but because something is pulling you forward—a low, resonant hum that vibrates in your molars. The sky is a bruised purple, split by a single beam of moonlight that pierces the canopy like a blade. You follow it.  

At the forest’s heart lies a cage. Not a cage of bars, but of silence. It’s made of frozen shadows, its edges sharp and glittering, enclosing a creature you can’t quite see. It shifts and coils, a mass of smoke and flickering amber eyes, its form constantly unraveling and reforming. When it notices you, it *roars*—a soundless scream that vibrates in your bones. You freeze. Your throat tightens. This is the thing you’ve buried, the thing you’ve starved for decades. It’s your anger.  

But here, in the dream, you can’t look away. The cage begins to crack.  

A hand brushes yours. A woman stands beside you, her skin a mosaic of smoldering embers, her hair a crown of live wires. She smells of struck flint and thunderstorms. “You’ve kept it small,” she says, her voice a chorus of crackling flames. “You’ve fed it shame. But it’s not a monster. It’s a compass.” She steps into the cage as it shatters, and the creature lunges—not at her, but into her. It merges with her body, and she becomes a tempest: limbs of lightning, eyes like collapsing stars.  

The forest ignites.  

You should run, but your feet root to the soil as the flames lick the trees, not with destruction, but with revelation. The bark peels away to reveal glowing veins of gold beneath, pulsing like heartbeats. The fire isn’t burning the world—it’s burning away the lie that you must be small to survive. The woman-tempest turns to you, her face a shifting mosaic of every person who ever taught you to fear your own voice. “Scream,” she urges. “Not at them. For yourself.”  

You open your mouth.  

What comes out isn’t sound. It’s a flock of ravens, their wings trailing sparks. They spiral upward, tearing through the sky until it rips open, spilling not stars, but memories: your childhood hands clenched into fists you never dared uncurl; your teenage self swallowing words until they calcified into stones in your gut; the adult you, smiling through gritted teeth as someone stepped on your shadow. The ravens devour these memories, not cruelly, but with reverence, as if they’re sacred things you’ve denied their proper burial.  

The ground trembles. A cliffside materializes beneath your feet, jagged and raw, overlooking an ocean of liquid mercury. The woman-tempest presses her flaming palm to your chest, and your ribs become a cage of glass. Inside, your heart hammers like a trapped bird. “Let it break,” she whispers.  

You fall to your knees, not from pain, but from the weight of decades. The glass shatters. Your heart soars upward, still beating, still bleeding light. It hovers above you, and from its wounds spill not blood, but ink—thick, iridescent, alive. The ink rains down, pooling in the cliffside crevices to form words you’ve never dared write: *I was wronged. I am furious. I am allowed.*  

The mercury ocean below begins to churn, reflecting not your face, but the face of the child you were—the one who learned to fold rage into origami cranes and swallow them whole. The child waves at you, not with sadness, but with curiosity. You wave back.  

The woman-tempest dissolves into a thousand fireflies, and the sky bleeds into dawn. The cliff crumbles, but you don’t fall. You float, weightless, as the dream softens into a meadow of indigo grass. A phoenix alights on your shoulder, its feathers woven from the storm you once feared. It trills a melody that hums in your marrow: *Anger is not the weapon. Suppression is. Let it sing. Let it guide. Let it go.*  

You wake with salt on your lips and a warmth in your throat, as if you’ve finally swallowed sunlight.
