I am dreaming. I'm standing at the edge of a vast, stormy sea, the waves crashing against the shore with a ferocity that makes my heart pound in my chest. The sky above is a deep, foreboding grey, with clouds that seem to swirl and twist in every direction like living serpents. I'm holding onto someone's hand, but I don't know who it is - the grip is tight, desperate. I feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility for this person's safety, as if their wellbeing is entirely dependent on me.

As I look out to sea, I see a small boat struggling to stay afloat amidst the turbulent waters. The person whose hand I'm holding is on that boat, and I can feel their fear and panic radiating towards me like a palpable force. I'm consumed by a sense of dread, knowing that I'm the only one who can help them, but I'm stuck on the shore, unable to move.

The waves grow higher and higher, threatening to engulf the boat at any moment. I try to pull the person towards me, but they're too far away, and my efforts are futile. I'm shouting to them, trying to offer some words of comfort, but my voice is lost in the howling wind. The storm rages on, its fury unrelenting.

Suddenly, a massive wave crashes over the boat, and it's swallowed up by the sea. I'm left standing alone on the shore, the person's hand still clutched in mine, but it's limp now, lifeless. I'm overcome with grief and guilt, feeling that I've failed them in their time of need.

As the storm begins to subside, I look down at the hand I'm holding, and I see that it's mine. It's a smaller version of my own hand, a child's hand. I'm filled with a sense of horror and realization - the person I've been trying to save is a younger version of myself. I've been carrying the weight of my own past traumas and fears, and the burden has been crushing me.

The scene shifts, and I find myself standing in a desolate, abandoned landscape. The sky is still grey, but the air is calm and still. I'm surrounded by a sea of faces, all of them my own, but each one representing a different moment in my life. They're all looking at me, their eyes filled with a deep sadness and longing.

I realize that I'm not just responsible for one person's wellbeing, but for the wellbeing of all these different versions of myself. I'm carrying the weight of my own story, with all its complexities and challenges. The dream is telling me that I need to let go of the guilt and the shame, to release the burden of my past and trust that I did the best I could with the resources I had at the time.

As I stand there, surrounded by my own faces, I feel a sense of compassion and understanding wash over me. I know that I'm not alone, that I'm part of a larger narrative that's still unfolding. The dream begins to fade, and I'm left with a sense of peace, knowing that I'm strong enough to carry the weight of my own story, and that I'm not alone in this journey.
