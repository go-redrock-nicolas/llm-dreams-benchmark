I am dreaming. I am lost in a dense, misty forest, the air clings to me obscuring everything beyond a few feet of me. Every step feels heavy, like I'm wading through quicksand. The trees loom around me, casting long ominous shadows with their gnarled branches. It's an ancient, primeval place.

As I push forward through the dripping foliage, the mist parts to reveal a vast opening. There, at the far end, is a magnificent golden gate. It's covered in glittering symbols of wisdom and truth. Shimmering rays of light seem to emanate from it, calling to me. I recognize this gate - it represents the fulfillment of my greatest passions and desires. I've dreamed about reaching it for so long.

But as I approach the gate, I feel my legs fill with lead. I can't seem to move. The very clouds appear to grow dark and swirling, ominous and foreboding. A voice carries to me on the wind. "Tread very carefully. The gate ahead may seem inviting, but it's guarded by the ferocious Lion of Disappointment."

A loud roar resounds through the clearing, and a muscled, fearsome lion emerges from the shadows. His eyes are fierce, burning with the intensity of my deepest, most crippling fears. I realize my lifelong fears of rejection and heartbreak. I've been afraid to fully pursue what I want for so long, always keeping a tight leash on my dreams, fearful of being ravaged by this monster.

"My dear dreamer," a soft, silky voice speaks. This is the guiding tone of my intuition. "This fearsome beast is a creation of your own mind, a self-imposed barrier from living your truth." The lion, I now see, actually guards the REAL gate. The one I'd been approaching was merely a shadow and a facade; only an illusion of obtaining fulfillment.

I take a deep, shuddering breath and reach within my heart. I call up all of the strength and faith I possess. The words of wisdom of my guiding voice fill me with courage and determination. I approach the lion and meet his eyes, my own steady and unafraid. Slowly, slowly, I reach out and stroke his velvety fur. He shifts and calms, purring as alarm and suspicion melt away.

ForCanBeConvertedToForeachI am engaged in deep inner struggle as I lay on the forest floor. The lion lies next to me, and without warning he bites down hard on my throat, choking the life out of me. His fierce canines pierce my flesh, and blood bursts forth, splattering on the ground. I gasp and gag, shocked by the pain slamming into me.

This, too, I realize is the Lion of Disappointment, inflicting his full ferocity upon me. Terror takes hold as I feel oxygen being crushed from my lungs. I am being ravaged by this monster I've been afraid of, my greatest fears realized in their most graphic, brutal fashion. I feel my body go limp and my vision begin to fade...

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see a brilliant light. My spirit starts to depart, and I feel myself being pulled upward, away from the pain-ragged body the lion eviscerates. I see my physical form in the distance gradually becoming a lifeless corpse, but my spirit continues to ascend to a beautiful realm.

There, I am welcomed by the most stunning appearance I've ever seen - my radiant, immortalsense of self, in all my brillianthlory..

"A chance to confront your darkest fears in their full form, to stare into the abyss and emerge unbroken. Didn't you see - your physical body may have been destroyed, but your eternal spirit remains untouched and unharmed. You are impervious to even the worst manifestations of your own self-doubt and fear of failure.

"I know my dear that it is scary to face your dreams, your passions, the depths of your desires. Being around the gate that promises your highest aspirations can be daunting. Fear and dread may whisper to you, tempting you to hold back, to stay small, so you protect the delicate petals of your heart. But now, you see? Your deepest darkest terrors couldn't utterly destroy you. In fact, before they even delivered their worst, your spirit emerged and found its way home to me.

"Remember this lesson. There are no threats to your true survival. To live the life you dream, the one your beautiful heart and soul were made to embrace, you simply need to release your tight grip on safety. Let fear arise yet give it no dominion. In the face of your doubts and worst-case imaginings, walk toward your heart's flame of passion.

"Staying protected and small only furnishes you with 'do not hurt' and the illusion that you are 'not good enough.' Dreams half-realized only wind up blazing out. Dive into the fathomless joy and light you carry and giving your glorious unique gifts to the world. The gates of your highest aspirings await your presence and rejoice at your arrival."
