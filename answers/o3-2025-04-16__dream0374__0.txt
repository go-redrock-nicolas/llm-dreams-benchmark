I am dreaming. …find yourself standing at the lip of an impossible amphitheater—an ivory half-moon carved into the underbelly of a violet sky. Everything glows as though lit from the inside out: every stone warm with candlelight, every face bathed in an aurora of shifting blues and oranges. A cascade of applause rolls across the terraced seats like a tide of bronze coins, clinking and chiming, each cheer a tiny bell that rings inside your ribs.

At center stage, beneath a single braided column of sunshine, stands a colleague—someone familiar yet dream-blurred at the edges, the way photographs look after you’ve blinked too long. They cradle a trophy shaped like a split meteor: molten silver frozen mid-splash. Your heartbeat stumbles when you realize that the engraved lines winding around its surface are your own handwritten notes, the equations and sketches you once scrawled on napkins at dawn.

The master of ceremonies booms the colleague’s name—only their name—until the vowels reverberate against the amphitheater’s ribbed ceiling. Each repetition feels like a small sting, an echo that drifts down your spine and settles between your shoulder blades. A floodlight sweeps across the crowd but never lingers on you; you are walled in by shadow, as invisible as a breath in winter.

Jealousy flares first, hot and urgent—a fox darting in circles inside your chest. Your fists clench around empty air, nails biting crescents into your palms. The applause thickens, becomes a roaring waterfall. For an instant, you taste metallic bitterness, like biting into a coin.

The fox paces faster. Why not me? it growls. I built that scaffolding. I soldered those filaments of thought together until they sang. 

Suddenly the dream tilts. The marble beneath your feet ripples like water, and you slip through it without falling, as though gravity has taken the night off. You tumble into a dim corridor lined with floating pages—blueprints, formulas, half-finished paragraphs—each one inked in your handwriting. They drift past like schools of luminescent fish. Every page you reach for slides away, fluttering just out of touch, until they funnel toward the mouth of a brass megaphone growing from the darkness.

From that megaphone booms the colleague’s name again, louder, distorted, the syllables stretching like toffee. The fox inside your chest howls. The pages burn up in mid-air, sparks spiraling like wayward fireflies. 

Anger morphs into something denser, heavier—an unspoken sorrow. You feel yourself shrinking, as though your outline is made of chalk in the rain. All those late nights, the bruise-purple dawns, the heart you poured onto crumpled paper—does none of it shine unless someone else points a spotlight at it?

The corridor bends and opens into a circular mirror chamber. Mirrors float like translucent lily pads, showing an infinity of you—each version older, younger, laughing, tired, inspired. Yet every reflection shares the same detail: ink-stained fingertips. Your mark is there, even if no one outside the glass sees it.

A hush falls, as though someone has turned down the volume of existence. In that quiet, you notice a softer feeling settling in: pride, stripped of its need for outside witnesses. The mirrors shimmer, converge, and fuse into a single pane of water. When you touch it, ripples radiate, and within them you glimpse the colleague on stage again—now holding the meteor trophy above their head—but you also glimpse the circuitry of your ideas pulsing inside the metal, glowing with your signature.

Recognition may have missed its mark tonight, the dream whispers, but your work is stitched into the architecture of the triumph. Nothing can peel your fingerprints from the stars you helped shape.

The fox curls up, no longer pacing, its fur dimming from fiery orange to a quiet ember. The ache in your chest loosens. You inhale, and the air tastes like paper and sunrise. Exhale, and the mirrors dissolve into a galaxy of glass shards that drift upward, catching new light.

You allow yourself one final, unclenched breath—half anger, half acceptance, wholly human—and step forward. The dream breaks open into dawn’s pale peach, and applause becomes the rustle of wind in curtains. Somewhere far away an alarm clock chirps, but for a lingering moment you remain inside the hush, feeling—if not publicly celebrated—at least undeniably present, irreplaceably real, and ready to begin again.
