I am dreaming. As I step onto the stage, the warmly illuminated space seems to extend on forever with row upon row of expectantly eager faces. The soft hum of murmured conversations radiates throughout the cavernous hall, a mix of unfamiliar voices crashing against the echoes of memories long past.

To my left, a vibrant garden scene bursts forth from the shadows, a riot of colors that blend and shimmer in the soft light. Tropical greenery entwines itself around starkly real statues of mythological creatures known and forgotten. The heady scent of blooming flowers fills the air, creating a sense of intoxicating wonder.

But as I turn to face the masses of humanity gathered before me, a shiver runs down my spine. The harsh glare of unseen spotlights seems to pierce through the veil of reality, transforming the throngs of people into an unsettling canvas of expressions. Some appear heavy with anticipation and excitement, while others seem to hold themselves at a distance, their faces inscrutable masks of indifference.

I lift my head to clear my thoughts, and that's when I see it â€“ a gleaming, crystalline structure towering high in the distance. Its facets catch and reflect the light, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the darkened room. It's as if the very essence of the universe has taken physical form, a beacon calling out to something deep within my soul.

As I continue to gaze upon the shimmering wonder, the audience begins to stir, their movements becoming more pronounced and attention-grabbing. The air seems to crackle with an electric anticipation, and the statues come to life in the garden, their stone bodies imbued with a fluid grace and movement that belies their inanimate nature.

I realize that I stand at the threshold of a great moment in history, poised to unleash a torrent of words upon the masses. The significance of this event, the impact my speech could have on the course of the future, sends a shiver down my spine. And yet, as I look outward toward the mysterious structure in the distance, I sense a greater cosmic push unfolding, an undercurrent that transcends the limitations of time and space.

My heart pounding in my chest, I take a deep breath and allow the weight of reality to wash over me. On third thought, I decide that I've had enough dreaming. Despite the shock, I realize that I will have to go back to your reality sooner or later. I will force the scene to change, back to your perspective. The scene commences again three weeks later.

Right after I open the door to the living room, I freeze, but the sheet of paper sitting on Sheila's desk waits there patiently. It seems like time has stood still even though three weeks have passed. And it seems like the story has waited just for me. 

Despite my better judgment, I will be taking that sheet of paper. I know it, even before heading upstairs to let Michelle know what I've found.
