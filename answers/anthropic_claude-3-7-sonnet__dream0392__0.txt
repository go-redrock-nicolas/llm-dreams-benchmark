I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an ancient forest that breathes with its own consciousness. The trees tower impossibly high, their bark spiraling with luminescent patterns that pulse with gentle blue light. Each pulse seems synchronized with my heartbeat. I realize I've been here before, perhaps many times, though always forgetting upon waking.

A path of glowing moss stretches before me, winding through the massive trunks. Small creatures made of shadow and starlight dart between the undergrowth, leaving trails of glistening dew that evaporates into musical notes. The air tastes like memories—bittersweet, familiar yet distant.

As I follow the path deeper into the forest, the canopy above begins to thin, revealing a night sky unlike any I've seen in my waking life. Constellations form intricate patterns that seem to be writing and rewriting themselves, telling stories in a celestial language I somehow understand without words.

The path leads to a clearing where an enormous tree stands alone, its branches reaching out like tentative hands toward the cosmos. Its trunk is hollowed, forming a doorway framed by roots that curl and uncurl in rhythmic invitation. Inside, I can see shelves carved from living wood, holding countless glass bottles filled with swirling, colorful mist.

A figure emerges from behind the tree—neither young nor old, neither male nor female, with eyes reflecting the ever-changing sky above. They smile with recognition, as if we've met countless times before.

"You're beginning to remember," they say, voice resonating like distant thunder. "These bottles contain all your forgotten dreams. Your conscious mind dismisses them, but your deeper self has been collecting them here, waiting for you to return when you're ready to understand."

I reach for one bottle, its contents shimmering with the same blue light as the forest's bark. As my fingers touch the glass, I understand what my subconscious has been trying to tell me all along...
