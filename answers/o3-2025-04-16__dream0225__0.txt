I am dreaming. I am standing on an impossible shoreline at the very edge of sleep, where lavender surf exhales phosphorescent sighs and every grain of sand is a perfect, translucent prism. I know I am dreaming because gravity hums like a distant cello and time is folding in on itself like origami.

A spiral staircase of glimmering obsidian corkscrews up from the beach and pierces the low-hanging moon. Its steps are engraved with shifting constellations that rearrange themselves each time I blink. Somewhere between curiosity and vertigo, I climb.

At the summit I emerge into a colossal amphitheater suspended in the night sky. The architecture is equal parts coral and cathedral: ribs of iridescent stone curve overhead, catching the starlight in sweeping rainbows. An audience of unfamiliar figures waits—smoke-skinned scholars with parchment wings, clockwork hermits whose porcelain faces tick with tiny gears, and crystalline giants pulsing with glacial luminescence. All of them have arrived to compete for a single position: Celestial Polyphonist, Keeper of the Echoes Between Worlds.

I feel the hush of collective expectation wash over me like cold water. My résumé is laughable. I can barely strum a guitar, let alone translate the secret harmonies that bind galaxies together. Yet a silver-veined official whose eyes hold entire nebulae calls my name and gestures me forward.

“Your instrument,” she intones, presenting what looks like a droplet of liquid mercury. It quivers in her palm, reflecting my face in a dozen impossible angles. “It will become whatever you believe you can play.”

Everyone else is handed majestic devices: harps made of meteor fragments, ninety-string lutes woven from comet tails, brass horns forged in the cores of dying suns. I swallow hard and stare at my shimmering blob, which has now decided it is a lump of moist clay.

Phase One: Sight-Unseen Sonata. The other candidates sight-read sheets of glowing notation, their performances summoning ribbons of aurora that swirl overhead in organized fractals. When my turn arrives, I mold my mercury-clay instinctively. It stretches like taffy, splits into prismatic strands, and resolves into something that is simultaneously a flute and a spiraling nautilus shell. I raise it to my lips and breathe. The sound that emerges is not melodic—it’s the whir of cicadas on a summer porch, the whoosh of subway doors, the echo of a childhood laugh in an attic. Every memory I never had tumbles out, raw and unscored. The amphitheater hushes. For an instant, even the stars seem to lean closer.

Phase Two: Improvisation with Uncooperative Elements. We are herded onto a floating platform of slick obsidian. Lightning spiders across the surface, and gravity begins to slosh unpredictably, making us tumble like puppets. My competitors grip their polished instruments with professional poise, recalculating tempos and time signatures midair. I, on the other hand, barely stay upright. My nautilus-flute flutters like a wounded bird. Then I notice the lightning has a rhythm—seven quick flickers, one long, seven quick again. I tap the flute’s shell, matching its strobe, and whistle a counter-rhythm under my breath. Suddenly the platform stabilizes, responding as if calmed by the improvised duet. One by one, the professionals falter; their classical perfection can’t converse with chaos. My messy, stumbling syncopation thrives on it.

Phase Three: Communal Resonance. Each candidate must weave their song directly into the dreams of everyone present. The scholars unfurl their parchment wings and chant; the clockwork hermits wind up their gears; the crystalline giants lower their voices to seismic rumbles. I panic—I don’t know the first thing about shared dreaming except that I’m already in one. But then it strikes me: the dream is porous. It wants collaboration. I think of open windows and paper boats on rainy streets. I breathe through my shell-flute, sending out a humble melody of doorbells and kettle whistles, of whispers traded at 2 a.m. The auditorium shifts. The parchment wings soften into bedsheets; the clockwork ticking syncs to heartbeats; the crystalline rumble melts into the purr of a cat on a lazy afternoon. Every spectator feels something universally human, something delightfully mundane—and in that ordinariness, they find wonder.

A gong made of starlight reverberates. The judges convene, murmuring like distant thunderstorms. The silver-veined official returns, her eyes luminous.

“The Polyphonist is chosen,” she proclaims, and my name ripples across the sky in glowing cursive.

Gasps rise from the audience—some incredulous, some admiring. I stand petrified, flute-shell clutched to my chest. The official smiles, as if she hears my unspoken question: How did an amateur triumph over virtuosos?

“Expertise,” she says, “is fluent in rules. But dreams are native to the untrained heart.”

She presses a pendant into my palm: a tiny, rotating constellation trapped in glass. It hums with distant harmonies, waiting for me to explore.

The amphitheater dissolves in a flurry of prismatic feathers. I find myself back on the lavender shoreline, tide nibbling at my ankles, pendant glowing softly against my skin. Above me the moon snaps shut like a silver eyelid, and the dream dims—

—but not before a single, triumphant note escapes my nautilus-shell and arcs across the sky like a comet spelling one last word:

Believe.
