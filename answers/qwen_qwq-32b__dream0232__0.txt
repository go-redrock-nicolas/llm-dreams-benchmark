I am dreaming. Suddenly, I remember that a fundamental belief shaping my whole identity was built on a lie. The thought doesn't overwhelm me; instead, it's like a door opening.

I find myself in a vast, shimmering library. The walls are endless, lined with floating books. Each tome pulses with its own color. A figure made of starlight approaches. They speak in a voice that's a chorus of whispers, saying, "The lies you believed were seeds. Now you can choose what to grow."

The library begins to dissolve into a meadow under a twin sunset. I feel a gentle tug at my sleeveâ€”its a small, luminescent fox with fur like liquid mercury. It leads me to a tree with bark like cracked porcelain and fruit that glows like captured lightning. Eating the fruit, I taste paradoxes and possibilities.

Above, the sky fractures into a kaleidoscope, revealing other dreamers' skies. The fox vanishes, leaving a trail of silver pollen. I realize my 'false' belief was just a stage. Growth requires shedding skins, even painful ones. The pollen writes in the air: "Begin again, but differently."

I awake with a canvas of new questions, ready to rebuild not in fear, but curiosity.
