I am dreaming. Night has fallen in a sky of molten gold, the clouds like smoke from ancient secrets burned into the atmosphere. Somewhere distant, stars flicker with the rhythm of breath, and the air hums a low, harmonic melody — neither heard nor felt, but something deeper. Something remembered.

In this surreal realm, I am walking a path that isn’t there — made of glass shards and calm fire, each step both dissolving and creating. My feet don’t touch ground but rather glide just above it, as though the dream is coddling me, afraid I might break its delicate spell.

And then, they are there. A tight-knit group, standing in a circle near a tree with roots that rise like pillars to the heavens and leaves made of whispering shadows. Each figure radiates a strange energy — some warm like hearthlight, some sharp like mountain wind, others dark and still like the silence of deep water. This group has gathered here before, for years undetermined by clocks or calendars. They have laughed together in the language of stars, mourned in the silence of unspoken truths, and built something rare together — a shared, sacred rhythm of connection.

They open to me, not all at once, but with the slow recognition of a key fitting into a long-lost lock. A woman with eyes like twilight gives me a single nod — her presence is like a poem that hasn’t been written yet. An older man with skin etched like river stones offers a small wooden cup of something that flickers when I look at it. No words yet. Only gestures, loaded like seeds.

To my side, a silent youth with tangled hair made of moss slips me a stone, cold and pulsing. I feel something transfer — not knowledge, but understanding. A memory not my own and yet wholly intimate.

The dream has its own language.

In the center of the circle, a ritual starts, not of religion, but of presence. We are not praying — we are remembering, like dying stars reconvening to share their final light. One by one, they tell fragments of stories — not long ago or far away, but moments excavated from the sacred caves of their lives. Lessons in loss. Truths in laughter. The taste of fear, swirled like wine and released like a bird.

And me — when the circle turns to me, I have no stories. Yet in that silence, a story begins to rise. One that I had forgotten, one that wasn't ready until now. I speak not in words but in color, scent, sensation — they listen with the same reverence one holds a flame against the wind.

The tree hums in response, its roots humming with a music older than language.

We are connected not by blood or birth, but by something deeper — the invisible threads of understanding spun in the loom of time. In the waking world, they may be strangers. But here, in this deep dream woven from the marrow of my mind, we are ancient friends, re-united for the briefest eternity.

And as the dream fades, not with alarm but like a tide retreating from the shore, I carry them with me — alive in the electric quiet of my soul. When I awaken, I can still taste the moss, hear the roots breathe, and feel the glow of the silent flame burning behind my eyes.

Some dreams are doors. I have simply stepped through.
