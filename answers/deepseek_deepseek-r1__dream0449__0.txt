I am dreaming. <placeholderno3>

**Dream Sequence:** 

I stand on a shoreline of liquid mercury, the metal pooling like molten glass under a sky strewn with nebulae. The constellations pulse in time with my breath, their light reflecting off the rippling silver below. A bridge materializes ahead, woven from shadows and spider silk, stretching toward a floating island where trees hum with bioluminescent secrets. As I step forward, the mercury hardens into mirrored tiles, each one showing a fractured version of me—older, younger, laughing, weeping. A whisper coils around my ankles: *"What if the voids aren’t hollow? What if they’re thresholds?"* 

The air smells like burnt sugar and rain. A staircase spirals upward from the island, its steps carved from translucent jade. Halfway up, I meet a figure with antlers made of smoke and eyes like eclipses. They extend a hand, offering a key forged from a question: *"Is absence a wound, or a womb?"* Below, the mercury sea begins to crystallize into forests of silver coral. I realize the gaps I feared—the unanswered questions, the uncertain paths—are not chasms but chrysalides. The dream shifts, and I wake clutching the warmth of possibility like a stone smoothed by the river of the unknown.
