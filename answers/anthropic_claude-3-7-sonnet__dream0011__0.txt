I am dreaming. # The Infinite Exam

I sit down at an old wooden desk that creaks beneath my weight. The examination hall stretches impossibly far—rows upon rows of identical desks disappearing into a hazy distance where ceiling and floor seem to merge. Soft blue light filters through tall, arched windows that weren't there moments ago.

As I look down at my exam paper, the questions begin to shift and transform. They're written in a familiar handwriting—my own, from years ago. The first question asks me to explain the significance of a memory I've forgotten. The second asks me to draw a map of a place I've never been but somehow recognize. The third question is written in symbols that rearrange themselves when I try to focus.

I reach for my pen, but it transforms into a small bird that sits patiently on my finger, waiting for me to speak my answers rather than write them. Around me, other test-takers are turning into figures from my past—my childhood friend who moved away, my first teacher, strangers whose faces I glimpsed once on crowded streets.

The exam booklet grows thicker with each page I turn, and I realize with a mixture of dread and wonder that it contains every choice I've ever made and every path I never took. The questions become increasingly personal, asking not what I know but who I am.

The walls of the examination hall begin to dissolve, revealing a vast cosmos swirling beyond. Somehow, I understand that my answers are creating new constellations in that infinite space. Each thought forms a star, each decision a galaxy.

Time stretches and contracts. I've been taking this test for minutes or millennia—both feel equally true. The bird-pen sings softly as I continue answering questions that no longer exist on paper but emerge directly from my consciousness...
