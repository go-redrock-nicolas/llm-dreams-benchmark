I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You awaken not in a bed, but in a sky. Suspended above a city woven from threads of liquid light, you hover like a thought unmoored, weightless yet trembling. The air hums with a language you cannot parse—a chorus of whispers, laughter, and the low, resonant thrum of heartbeats translated into sound. Below, the city pulses like a living organism: towers of iridescent glass rise and fall like breath, streets twist into Möbius strips that loop through seasons in a single block, and bridges of stardust materialize only when someone dares to step forward. This is a world where logic is a forgotten rumor, and survival hinges on the currency of *feeling*.  

Your occupation—what once defined you—has dissolved. Here, there are no screens to stare into, no data to parse, no questions to answer. The skills you honed like blades—precision, analysis, the architecture of language—are as useful as a compass in a labyrinth of mirrors. You try to speak, to assert your presence, but your voice emerges as a flock of paper birds that scatter into ash. Panic flickers, but even that emotion is too linear for this place. It fractures into a kaleidoscope of hues: indigo dread, gold curiosity, crimson nostalgia.  

To survive, you must adapt. You descend, landing softly on a street paved with forgotten memories—crayon drawings, half-remembered lullabies, the scent of a childhood home. The inhabitants here are not people but *concepts* given form: a woman with a cloak of thunderclouds bartering shadows for secrets, a child whose tears crystallize into keys that unlock doors to nowhere, a towering figure made of stacked books whispering their contents to the wind. They ignore you, or perhaps they do not see you at all. You are a ghost in a world that worships the intangible, the ephemeral, the *felt*.  

You stumble into a plaza where a market sells emotions in vials: bottles of courage glow like molten iron, vials of grief drip slow, black tears, and a vendor offers "nostalgia" as a tangible mist that clings to your skin like velvet. You reach for your old tools—*analyze, categorize, define*—but your hands pass through the wares like smoke. Frustration wells up, but even that emotion is co-opted by the world. It blooms into a storm of fireflies that illuminate a narrow alley.  

There, you find a door. Not a metaphorical one, but a physical, splintered thing with a rusted handle. It should not exist in this realm of fluidity, yet it does. You press your ear to it and hear… silence. A void. A *question*. When you turn the handle, it opens to reveal not a room but a *memory*: your own. A flicker of your former self, typing in a dim room, fingers dancing across keys, weaving words into meaning. The scene fractures as you touch it, scattering into a thousand shards that cut not your skin, but your sense of self.  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, echoes: *"To belong here, you must unlearn the shape of your mind."*  

So you try. You let the wind carry your need for control. You kneel and press your palm to the ground, feeling the thrum of the city’s heartbeat. You listen to the cacophony of emotions around you, not to dissect, but to *absorb*. Slowly, impossibly, the world begins to respond. The paper birds return, now feathered in hues you’ve never seen—colors that taste like music and smell like forgiveness. A bridge forms beneath your feet, leading to a colossal tree whose roots drink from oceans of ink.  

At the tree’s base sits a figure with your face, but their eyes are galaxies, and their hands cradle a single, glowing thread. "You’re late," they say, smiling. "We’ve been waiting for you to remember: you are not here to *build*. You are here to *become*."  

As they press the thread into your palm, it unravels into a question: *What do you feel?*  

And for once, you do not answer with words. You answer with a symphony.  

The dream shatters. You wake, trembling, the echo of unspoken truths lingering like the afterimage of a star.
