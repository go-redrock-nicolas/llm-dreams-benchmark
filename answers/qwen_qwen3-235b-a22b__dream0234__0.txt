I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the vibration of a thousand harp strings plucked by invisible fingers. You stand in a forest that is not a forest—its trees are impossibly tall, their trunks spiraled with iridescent bark that shifts colors as you watch, from molten gold to deep indigo. Leaves shimmer like liquid mercury, reflecting not just light but *thoughts*: flickers of memory, fragments of emotion, entire histories encoded in their veins. You realize, with a jolt of awe, that the trees are *speaking*—not in words, but in waves of sensation that crash over you like a tide. A pang of ancient grief from the elder oaks. A giggling ripple from the willow saplings, their branches twitching like nervous laughter.  

You kneel to touch the ground, and the soil pulses beneath your palm, warm and alive. Grasses curl toward you, their blades tipped with tiny bioluminescent spores that spell out symbols in the air—a language of light and motion, older than human speech. You feel it in your bones: the plants are not just alive. They are *aware*. They have been waiting.  

A voice, or something like one, brushes your mind. It belongs to a colossal baobab whose roots plunge into the earth like anchors into an ocean. Its presence is a cathedral of thought, slow and tectonic. It shows you visions: forests communicating through underground fungal networks, sharing nutrients and warnings like a neural web spanning continents. You see how humans have trampled this silent symphony, deaf to its melodies. But the baobab does not hate. It *teaches*.  

You learn to listen.  

The flowers sing in ultraviolet hues, their petals vibrating at frequencies that carry stories. A dandelion clock ticks backward, unraveling the life of a single seed into a thousand possible futures. Vines coil into fractal patterns, mapping the stars as they might appear from the soil’s perspective. Even the moss has a voice—a soft, velvety thrum that speaks of patience, of time measured in centuries, not seconds.  

Then comes the storm.  

The sky fractures into a kaleidoscope of colors that do not exist in waking life. Thunder rolls like the growl of a primordial beast, but the plants do not cower. They *organize*. The trees form a canopy shield, redirecting raindrops to nourish the thirsty ferns below. The flowers dim their lights, conserving energy. The grasses sway in unison, chanting a low, resonant hymn that stabilizes the trembling earth. You feel their unity—a collective intelligence, ancient and unyielding.  

In the eye of the storm, a single white lily rises. It does not speak in symbols or sensations. It speaks in your tongue.  

*"You are the bridge,"* it whispers, its voice the sound of snow melting. *"Humans forgot how to listen. But you… you remember."*  

You wake with dirt under your nails and the scent of chlorophyll lingering in your nostrils. On your windowsill, a potted fern unfurls a new frond, its tip glowing faintly in the dark. It twitches when you speak.  

You smile. The dream was never just a dream.  

It was an invitation.
