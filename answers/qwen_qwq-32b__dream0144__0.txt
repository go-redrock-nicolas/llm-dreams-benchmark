I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, open space, surrounded by soft, shifting sands that ripple like water under a starless sky. The temperature is cool but the air feels charged, alive. I become conscious of others around me - figures emerging from the shifting dunes, their outlines blurred but friendly. I realize they’re others who’ve faced struggles I currently face. 

The first person to approach me is someone whose face keeps changing - young, old, genderless. Their voice sounds like water hitting stone. "We know the weight you carry," they say, "because we've carried it too." 

Then another person steps forward, their hands covered in scars that glow faintly. "Let me show you what healing looks like," they say. They press their hands to the sand, and where their scars touch the earth, flowers burst up - black petals, glowing like embers. Each bloom whispers a secret in a language I almost understand. 

Next to them stands someone who moves like smoke, shifting opacity. "It's okay to feel lost sometimes," they say. "Even after you've found your way. The path isn't linear, it spirals. Look." They reach into their chest and pull out a glowing orb - a tiny galaxy spinning inside. "This is where your courage lives. Carry it with you, even when it feels heavy." 

There's a woman with hair that shifts colors based on her emotions - right now it's a soothing blue. She extends a hand and where my skin touches hers, warmth spreads. "Let me teach you how to listen to your pain. It's a teacher, not an enemy." Together we hear the hum of our struggles, like low strings on an invisible cello. 

Finally, an elder with eyes like twin supernovas steps forward. "The wound is where the light gets in," they say, quoting something ancient but new. "Remember that when doubt comes." They wrap a thread of starlight around my wrist, glowing silver. 

The group fades as I wake, but the sensations linger - the scent of night-blooming sand flowers, the weight of that silver thread on my wrist. My struggle still exists, but now there's a chorus of voices in my mind, urging me onward.
