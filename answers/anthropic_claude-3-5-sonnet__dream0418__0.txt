I am dreaming. ....

I find myself in a peculiar glass elevator that seems to float in an endless void of swirling purple and midnight blue mists. As I withdraw deeper into this transparent sanctuary, I can see shadowy figures moving past on invisible floors - they wave, smile, and gesture for me to join them, their forms both inviting and ethereal.

My heart aches with a profound loneliness, yet my hands press against the cool glass walls, keeping me separate from these potential connections. The elevator continues its strange journey, sometimes moving sideways, sometimes upwards, carrying me through this liminal space of my own creation.

The figures outside begin to take more familiar shapes - I recognize fragments of past friendships, missed opportunities, and moments where I chose solitude over connection. Their faces reflect both understanding and gentle reproach. Small spots of warmth appear on the glass where their hands meet my own through the barrier.

The elevator starts filling with floating orbs of soft, warming light - each one containing a memory of genuine connection, joy shared with others, laughter around dinner tables, and embraces that felt like coming home. These lights pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat, growing brighter when I acknowledge them, dimming when I try to look away.

Suddenly, the glass walls begin to slowly dissolve like sugar in rain, but rather than feeling exposed or afraid, I feel the artificial boundary between myself and others melting away. The shadowy figures are closer now, their presence both challenging and comforting. I realize I've built this transparent cage myself, piece by piece, day by day.

As the last of the glass disappears, the void transforms into a vast garden of bioluminescent flowers, each bloom representing a potential connection waiting to be nurtured. My hands, no longer pressed against glass, reach out tentatively toward the nearest figure, who smiles with patient understanding.

The dream shifts, and I'm writing letters in shimmering ink that floats off the page, carrying my thoughts and feelings to all those I've held at arm's length. Each letter transforms into a butterfly of light, finding its way to its intended recipient, building bridges across the gaps I've created.

I awaken with the profound understanding that my withdrawal, though feeling like protection, has become its own form of pain - and that the key to the door I've locked myself behind has always been in my own hands...
