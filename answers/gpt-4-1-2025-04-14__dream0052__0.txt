I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the world is liminal and luminous, woven together from colors I have never seen and scents that hum ancient melodies in my nostrils. The sky stretches overhead—a swirling tapestry of opal mist and violet sighs—while beneath my feet, the ground pulses gently, as though the heartbeat of the earth rumbles just below my skin.

Suddenly, from the horizon, a messenger draped in a shroud of shimmering fireflies approaches me. She carries a scroll wound in silver thread. Her eyes, like bottomless moons, bore into me as she hands it over with trembling hands. The air tightens around us, clutching the moment in suspense.

I open the scroll; the letters rearrange themselves, spelling out words I sense more than see: *You are not who you thought you were. A new life, unexpected and wondrous, waits for you beyond the waking world.*

A thousand emotions clash inside me—a hurricane of joy, terror, relief, disbelief. My pulse is wild, echoing in my ears like distant thunder. I feel the gaze of spectral figures gathering around me, their faces sympathetic yet expectant—would I laugh? Cry? Collapse? Or soar?

I close my eyes, drawing a breath so deep that it tastes like starlight poured over honey. The universe hushes. Every thought fractures into glittering fragments, swirling around me like a galaxy in miniature.

I choose, slowly, to smile.

For in this dream, every ending is only another beginning, and with every revelation, the world grows larger and stranger—and I, too, become capable of more than I ever dared believe.
