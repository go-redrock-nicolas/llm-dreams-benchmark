I am dreaming. (I am dreaming; my consciousness slips into a world of vivid, unreal clarity. The dream begins in a landscape that shifts between lush, green forests and barren, rocky deserts, as if the terrain itself cannot decide what it wants to be. A breeze, warm and fragrant with the scent of blooming flowers, sweeps through the dream, carrying with it whispers of distant voices. I walk along a winding path, unsure of where it leads, but compelled to follow it nonetheless. 

The path twists and turns, leading me deeper into the forest. The trees grow taller and closer together, their branches intertwining to form a canopy that blocks out the sky. The air grows heavy, and I feel a sense of foreboding creep into my mind. The whispers grow louder, more insistent, and I realize they are not coming from the wind, but from the trees themselves. They are speaking in a language I do not understand, but the emotion behind their words is clear. They are warning me. 

I quicken my pace, afraid of what lies ahead, but the path only grows narrower and more treacherous. The trees lean in closer, their roots snaking across the ground, threatening to trip me with every step. I begin to run, my heart pounding in my chest, the whispers now a cacophony of sound that fills my ears. 

Suddenly, the forest opens up into a vast, empty plain. The ground is cracked and dry, and the air is hot and oppressive. In the distance, I see a figure standing alone, silhouetted against the setting sun. As I approach, I realize it is a woman, her face hidden by a veil of shadows. She turns to me, and I feel a jolt of recognition. It is my own reflection, staring back at me, her eyes filled with a mixture of sorrow and fear. 

"You have been running from me," she says, her voice soft and trembling. "From the part of yourself you fear the most." 

I want to deny it, to turn and run again, but something holds me in place. The woman stretches out her hand, offering it to me. I hesitate, unsure if I can trust her, but the look in her eyes is one of compassion, not malice. Trembling, I reach out and take her hand. 

As soon as our fingers touch, a wave of emotion crashes over me. It is a feeling I have long buried, one I have kept hidden even from myself. It is grief, deep and overwhelming, mingled with anger and regret. Tears stream down my face as I allow myself to feel it fully, for the first time in years. 

The woman—my reflection—steps closer, her veil lifting to reveal her face. She is beautiful, radiant, and whole. "You do not have to carry this burden alone," she says, her voice now steady and strong. "I am here with you, and together, we can face anything." 

The dream begins to fade, the forest and the plain dissolving into nothingness. But as I drift back into wakefulness, I carry with me the memory of that embrace, and the knowledge that I am not alone.)
