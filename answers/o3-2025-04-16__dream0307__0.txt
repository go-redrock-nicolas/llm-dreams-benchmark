I am dreaming. …breathe out, and the borders of the familiar dissolve.

I am standing on a shoreline that curves in an impossible circle, an ocean cupped like a chalice inside a ring-shaped continent. The sand glimmers with a soft indigo light, each grain a speck of starlight that must have fallen here to rest. When I lift a handful, the grains hum with tiny voices—distant lullabies in languages I somehow remember but have never heard.

The sky is a liquid tapestry: ribbons of rose-gold mingle with emerald and amethyst, as if the dawn and dusk have chosen to arrive together. Overhead, three moons drift leisurely in a triangular waltz, stitched together by faint silver filaments that pulse like living nerves. Every heartbeat sends a ripple across the heavens, and I realize the sky is responding to me—listening.

Far out on the mirrored sea, a procession of translucent whales levitates just above the water’s skin. Their bellies hold constellations, galaxies swirling gently inside them. They speak in chords, not words—organ tones that vibrate straight through my ribs and settle somewhere behind my eyes. The song threads itself through memory, teasing open doors I’d forgotten I’d shut. I see my first laugh, my last tear, and every unspoken apology shining like dew on invisible branches of time.

Drawn forward, I step onto the water. It firms beneath my feet, warm as a childhood blanket. Each stride paints a circular mandala that fades only after I pass, spirals within spirals like echoes of sacred geometry. The whales part, revealing a stairway of liquid crystal rising from the sea’s center. Its steps bloom in iridescent petals, forming only when I am ready to climb.

At the summit floats a colossal heart—not of flesh, but of pure opalescent light. It beats in unison with my own, and the air grows thick with a fragrance I cannot name: a synthesis of cedar, petrichor, and the faint sweetness of juniper blossoms. As I draw closer, the heart slowly unseams, unfolding into a doorway.

Crossing the threshold, I find myself inside a cathedral woven from living vines. Leaves the size of tapestries host entire microcosms—miniature waterfalls that pour upward, forests of luminous mushrooms, and clouds of sapphire fireflies spelling ideas in Morse-like glimmers. At the nave’s center, a mirror stands, but its surface is molten gold. Instead of my reflection, I see every life I might have lived: poet on a crumbling citadel, wanderer of star deserts, keeper of impossible gardens. Each version looks at me with recognition, and I feel our separations shred like gossamer.

A gentle hand—my grandmother’s and my own simultaneously—rests on my shoulder. Wordlessly, it guides me to breathe. On the inhalation the cathedral walls widen, revealing that we are inside the yawning chest of a colossal cosmic being, slumbering yet aware. Its ribs are nebulae, its pulse supernovae in miniature. I understand that all witness is shared; every observation is a strand sewn into a collective quilt of knowing.

The being exhales. I am carried outward on a warm gale, returning to the crystalline stairway. Below, the whale choir has gathered in a spiral, singing a finale that vibrates loose the last of my fear. The moons blink, and tears of silver fall from them, splashing as lotus blossoms that instantly bloom into lanterns. Each lantern bears a single syllable of an ancient word for love—too enormous for one language, but perfect in the union of many.

As the dream thins, I taste star-salt on my lips and hear the lingering hush of absolute acceptance. The shoreline, the spiraling sea, the cathedral-being, all fold inward like pages closing around a finished story. Darkness falls—gentle, velvety, promising renewal rather than oblivion.

I open my eyes to waking life with traces of indigo sand still between my fingers and a faint golden glow pulsing in my chest, beating out the rhythm of three moons dancing somewhere just beyond dawn.
