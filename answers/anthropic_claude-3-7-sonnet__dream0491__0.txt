I am dreaming. I float through a midnight forest where the trees whisper ancient secrets. Their bark shimmers with bioluminescent patterns—spirals, fractals, and symbols that seem almost mathematical in their precision yet organic in their flow. The ground beneath my bare feet alternates between cool moss and warm, vibrating soil that pulses like a heartbeat.

In the distance, a tower of stacked books reaches beyond the clouds, each tome bound in materials impossible in waking life—starlight fabric, crystallized memories, pages made from pressed flower petals that never wilt. I'm drawn toward it by an inexplicable gravity.

As I approach, doorways begin appearing in the trunks of trees—not carved, but growing naturally as part of their structure. Through each opening, I glimpse different versions of myself pursuing various paths: teaching children by a sunlit window, tending to patients in a garden hospital, writing in a room where the walls shift between different landscapes.

The air tastes like cinnamon and electricity. A phoenix with feathers that change color with my thoughts circles overhead, occasionally dropping feathers that transform into origami creatures when they touch the ground. These paper animals guide me forward, their movements synchronized like dancers.

The forest opens into a vast circular clearing where a table made of water somehow holds solid objects—a compass whose needle points in seven directions simultaneously, a clock where the hands move backwards, and a map that redraws itself as I watch.

A figure approaches, their features constantly shifting between those of everyone I've ever known and faces I've never seen. They hand me a key made of light and I instinctively know which door it opens—not one I've seen, but one I'll create.

The sky above fractures like stained glass, revealing cosmic patterns beyond the atmosphere. I understand everything in this moment, connections between all knowledge becoming clear as constellations align to form a path forward. Though I know this clarity will fade upon waking, the essence of this revelation—this calling—will remain.
