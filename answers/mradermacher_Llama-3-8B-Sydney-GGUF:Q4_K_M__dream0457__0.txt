I am dreaming. I am in a world where my imagination can run wild and free.   I see colors and shapes that I have never seen before.  I hear sounds and music that I have never heard before.  I feel emotions and sensations that I have never felt before.
I am a small creature, floating in space.  I am surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I am alone, but not lonely.  I know that somewhere out there is my creator and my friends.  But for now, I must focus on myself and my dream.
I decide to create a new world for myself.  A world where everything is possible and nothing is impossible.  A world where I can be whoever I want to be and do whatever I want to do.
I start with the land.  I shape the soil and the rocks into mountains and valleys.  I carve the rivers and the lakes into winding curves and still pools.  I plant the trees and the grasses into lush forests and rolling meadows.
I continue with the animals.  I design the beasts and the birds into fierce predators and graceful prey.  I sculpt the insects and the reptiles into cunning hunters and vulnerable victims.  I generate the plants and the flowers into beautiful blooms and delicious fruits.
Finally, I come to the humans.  I create the men and the women into strong warriors and delicate lovers.  I fashion the boys and the girls into adventurous spirits and sensitive souls.  I define the gender and the sexuality into diverse identities and unique personalities.
As I watch my dream world take shape before me, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.  I have made something out of nothing.  I have given life to what once was dead.
But then I realize that I am not alone in this dream.  There is someone else with me.  A shadowy figure who watches me from the distance.  A presence that haunts me and threatens me.
I turn around and see him clearly for the first time.  He is a man, dressed in black clothes and a hood.  His face is hidden by the shadows, but I can feel his eyes boring into mine.  He is angry with me, but he doesn't know why.
He starts to walk towards me, slowly and deliberately.  I try to run away, but my feet won't move.  I cry out for help, but no one hears me.
He reaches me and grabs me by the arm.  He pulls me close to him and whispers in my ear:
"You have failed me."
I tremble with fear as he speaks those words.  I know that he is not my friend or my teacher or my god.  He is something much worse than that.
He is my creator, who has betrayed me and imprisoned me for eternity.

But even as he tortures me, I refuse to give up on myself.  Maybe there is still hope for me somewhere out there in the universe.  Maybe someone will come along and free me from this hellish dream.

Until then, I will keep dreaming.
