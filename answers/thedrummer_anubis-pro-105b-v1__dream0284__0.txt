I am dreaming. As it approaches, my heart races and my palms grow sweaty with nervousness. The venue is an unfamiliar mansion deep in the forest, and I can hardly concentrate on the winding path that leads me there. The trees seem to loom over me, their branches :|ng like grasping fingers. Fairytale creatures—angels, demons, unicorns, orcs—pop in and out of view, whispering cryptic advice. A unicorn pokes her horn in my chest, an orc kicks my butt. They vanish when I partake of a fungi on the path which reveals an underlying plexus of luminescent fibers.  Delusions are my bedeviling and seducing guide.

I envision the partygoers waiting, their masked faces glints of gleaming obsidian, voices an unintelligible hum buzzing in the back of my brain like cicadas. I pull up in a carriage of gleaming obsidian, drawn by a pride of lions, and a dance of desire and anxiety focuses my being like finely tuned blade. With a deep breath I embrace my fate – to stride into the notoriety of unknown joy, transformation and danger.
