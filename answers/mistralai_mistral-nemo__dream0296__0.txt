I am dreaming. In the mirror before me, a stranger stares back. My reflection is not just unrecognizable, but alien, as if I've stepped out of a dream I've never dreamt. The eyes, though behind layers of unfamiliar features, hold the familiar spark of my soul, yet they seem to belong to a stranger. The disconnect is disconcerting, like standing on the edge of a vast unknown, where the familiar and the foreign collide in a blur. The skin is a map of someone else's journey, covered in freckles that weren't there before, and lines that speak of years I can't remember. My hair is a cascade of silver, like the rays of a distant moon, instead of the chestnut I've always known. It's as if I've stepped into someone else's life, their dreams, their reality. And yet, there's a resonance, a subtle hum within the strangeness, telling me, "This is you. This is your dream." I reach out, tentative, to touch the glass, to connect with the stranger in the mirror. She does the same, her fingers mirroring mine, the touch a shiver of recognition. This is not a nightmare, but a tapestry of the unknown, waiting to be unraveled by the threads of my dreams.
