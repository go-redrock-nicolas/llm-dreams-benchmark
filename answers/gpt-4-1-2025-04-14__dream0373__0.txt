I am dreaming. —I stand at the brink of a sunless chasm, the world softened into watercolor grays and running silvers. The ground beneath my feet is a tapestry of memories, each stitch glowing with moments I’ve lived: a childhood laughter, a tearful farewell, the trembling touch of another hand. But now, the ground quivers; the thread splits into two perilous paths.

To my left, a lush forest blooms, every vine thick with a radiant golden fruit—symbols of loyalty, promises kept with those I love. Yet with every step down this path, the light that shines from within me fades, and I feel a growing chill inside—like setting aside the wild, pulsing truth of who I really am.

To my right, a windswept cliffside stretches before a surging, sapphire sea. Here, on the wild precipice, stands the possibility of self-fulfillment, my spirit unleashed and singing atop the waves of freedom. But each stride away from the forest, I hear the echoing heartbeats of loved ones recede, as if I’m walking deeper into exile from their warmth and trust.

I cannot have both—cannot carry everyone with me while also flying high into the burning blue of selfhood. The weight of the decision paints the dream with heavy hues, mixing sorrow with the urgent spark of hope.

Kneeling at the split, the silence fills with the whisperings of both futures. Tears bloom without shame; a cool wind scatters silver petals across my face. Slowly, I gather a petal in each hand—one gold, one blue—and press them to my heart. I rise, back straightened by the gravity of this moment.

I decide. I walk. Every footstep is a quiet ache, but also a new song.

And as the path unfurls—bright and uncertain—sunlight cracks through the clouds. The dream reforms around the shape of my chosen journey, hopeful and bittersweet, shimmering at the delicate edge where impossible choices shape who I become.
