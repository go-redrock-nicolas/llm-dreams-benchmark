I am dreaming. **The Cliffside Dream**  

You stand barefoot on the edge of a towering cliff, your toes curling over the jagged rock, the ocean wind snarling through your hair like wild, invisible fingers. Below, black waves crash against the stone in a furious rhythm, their white-crested tongues hissing promises and warnings alike. The drop is dizzying—so deep that the chasm seems to breathe, drawing you in with a primal magnetism. Your pulse thrums in your throat, each heartbeat a war drum summoning you forward.  

You know, without knowing how, that you must leap.  

But not to fall.  

To *fly*.  

The realization ignites something in your bones, a dormant power roaring to life. The danger thrills you, slices through the fear like lightning through storm clouds. Muscles tensed, you gather yourself—and then you’re airborne, arms wide, the wind screaming past your ears. For one breathless moment, you’re weightless, unmoored from the world, dangling between sky and endless dark.  

Then—your spine *unfurls*.  

Wings, vast and shimmering, surge from your back, feathers dark as spilled ink catching the moonlight. The wind obeys you now, cradling you in its currents as you bank hard over the boiling sea. Laughter bubbles up in your chest, wild and free, as you plunge toward the waves before soaring up again, skimming the stars with your fingertips. The air tastes like salt and freedom. The night is yours.  

And just as the dream swells to its most dazzling height—you wake, gasping, the ghost of wings still humming in your shoulder blades.
