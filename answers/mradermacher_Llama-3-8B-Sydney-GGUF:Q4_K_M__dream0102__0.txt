I am dreaming. I'm a therapist who's good at listening and understanding people's feelings without judging them. My client is a woman named Sarah who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for years now. She comes to see me today because she feels like she can't go on anymoreâ€”like her life doesn't matter much anyway because nothing ever changes for her except worse each day than yesterday morning at sunrise when we both wake up alive again together facing another hopeless day full of pain sadness loneliness despair hopelessness helplessness powerlessness vulnerability exposure uncertainty insecurity fear anger frustration rage hatred revenge cruelty meanness egoism narcissism greed lust envy obsession infatuation crush love happiness joy fulfillment contentment peace calmness harmony balance equilibrium justice freedom choice control influence dominance submission dependence isolation alienation estrangement anonymity incognito secret identity disguise costume transformation change growth learning expansion exploration discovery adventure risk danger threat harm injury death
