I am dreaming.  

Silver mist drifts around my ankles as I stand before a dais carved from living crystal—its facets catch the glow of ten suns that hang low in the violet sky. A voice, both whispered and thunderous, proclaims me Commander of the Astral Vanguard—an elite task force sworn to quell the starvation of planets, to tame errant stars, to guard the thin membrane between worlds. My heart hammers; I’ve never studied starships, never memorized battle doctrine. And yet, in this dream-realm, I wear a uniform stitched from Orion’s belt, and the assembled experts—mechanical hawks with cobalt eyes, telepathic code-weavers whose tattoos writhe like fractals—already await my orders.  

They look at me with unblinking scrutiny. The chief engineer, a towering figure whose limbs are etched with glowing runes, tilts her head and says, “We’ve never known a leader who can’t recite the ten thousand protocols.” Around us, the corridor shimmers—floor tiles pulsing in rainbow waves, walls that breathe like living tissue. The strategists’ voices ripple through the air in dissonant chords, questioning, doubting. My mind races: how does one command when one doesn’t belong?  

I inhale the scent of electric ozone and imagine a new tactic: instead of reciting manuals, I weave a vision. From my outstretched hand drift molten motes of light, coalescing into a map of shifting galaxies. “See,” I murmur, “the red sun that flickers at the edge of collapse—if we reroute the energy currents through its magnetic crown, we can reignite its core.” The room hushes. The mechanical hawks scratch their irises; the code-weavers’ tattoos ripple in agreement. For the first time, the skeptics lean forward.  

We’re hurtling through hyperspace—stars unravel like ribbons in our wake—as I coordinate their talents: the engineer reconfigures a gravity drive from moon dust, the psychic tactician melds our thoughts into one seamless plan, the reconnaissance drones scatter to map the storm of mutant comets ahead. I shout equations I don’t remember learning; they flow through me as if I’ve always known them.  

At the storm’s edge, reality trembles. Lightning arcs between floating debris, forging bridges of raw, crackling energy. I point to a way through the chaos—no manual could’ve taught this path—and the Vanguard surges after me, trust replacing doubt in their eyes. Side by side, we navigate the electric maze, and for a moment, I am both student and master, a conduit for something greater than myself.  

Then, as quickly as it began, the tempest calms. The violet sky softens into the palest rose, the crystal dais dissolves into drifting petals, and my uniform frays into stardust. The experts kneel in the dust, faces upturned in awe—no longer skeptics but believers in this raw, untrained spark that led them across the impossible.  

I wake—or so I think—but the whisper of that violet sun lingers in my bones, and I know: even unseasoned hearts can guide the brightest destinies.
