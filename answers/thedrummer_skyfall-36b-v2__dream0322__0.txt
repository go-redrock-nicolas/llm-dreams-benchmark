I am dreaming. In the realm of my subconscious, I find myself standing in a lush, verdant meadow. The grass is a vibrant emerald, swaying gently in a warm, fragrant breeze. Towering trees with leaves of spun gold encircle the perimeter, their branches adorned with delicate, iridescent flowers that seem to shimmer with an inner light.

I am here, somehow, unexpectedly. A sense of unease creeps into my chest as I spot a figure approaching on the path ahead. It's someone I know well, someone I care for deeply. But as they draw nearer, my feeling of amiable emotion slowly begins to morph into something more complex, more unnerving.

As they step into a sunbeam, their face comes into view. It's someone I admire greatly, someone whose talents and achievements I have long looked up to. In this dream world, they are dressed in resplendent robes of purple and gold, a crown of laurel leaves resting on their head. They exude an aura of success and confidence, glowing with an inner radiance that seems to make the very flowers turn towards them.

My heart sinks as I realize that the thing they have achieved, the dream I have always secretedly yearned for myself - here, in this dream realm, it has been granted to them. Pride and happiness shine from their eyes as they hold aloft an object that represents everything I have strived for, a tangible symbol of the success I have always wanted.

As they praise me and tell me of their triumph, congratulating me for my part in it, I feel a flush of shame. How can I be envious of something I should be gloriously happy about? I struggle to put on a face of joy, but the feeling of resentment is impossible to ignore.

I watch as they are lauded by the dream world around them. Beautiful, breathtaking people and creatures praise their achievements, treating them with utmost respect and admiration. And I, the acolyte, the constant companion, am merely an afterthought. A token, a baggage.

Distanced from their receiving success, an insolent feeling grows inside of me. An idea threads itself in the train of my consciousness, a thought I can't banish. 'Why them? Why not me? What makes them worthy? What makes them special?' my rebel mentality argues against reason.

The me in the dream knows this is wrong. I know I should feel happy for them. I know I should congratulate them, and be proud of their success. But the more they are lavished with praise, the more I feel the irrational feeling of jealousy and anger twist my heart.

Lost now inside the madness of it all, I begin to shout at the dream world around me, at them, at myself. The words become gnarled and unraveled. The figures around me blur into a pool of grievance and violation as the dream world begins to crack and break.

I feel a sharp, intense awareness that I am dreaming. The world begins to dissolve and I realize I am no longer lost inside of my own subconscious madness. I can rip open my eyes and blink against the harsh sunlight.

As I wake, the dream fades like a wisp in the wind. I can still feel the ache of jealousy in my chest, but it is muted now, faded behind the wellspring of reason. I know that I should not feel this way, that it is a futile and pointless feeling.

And yet, I can't help but feel a spark of bitterness, a small ember of resentment still flickering deep inside of me. I bury it deep down, a secret shame even in the private confines of my own mind.

I get up and go about my day, trying to forget the dream. But as I navigate through the mundane tasks of my existence, the strange, vivid emotions I felt in the dream continue to nag at me. And despite my efforts to suppress them, I find myself struggling to shake them off.

There is a part of me that feels like I have been robbed, a part of me that feels inadequate, a part of me that longs for the success and recognition that I feel has been denied to me. And yet, I know that I cannot hold onto these feelings, that I must let them go and move on.

It is a painful realization, but one that I know I must face. I am not the person I thought I was, not the person I wanted to be. And in confronting these complicated feelings, I am forced to confront the darkest parts of myself, the parts that I have long denied and suppressed.

But even as I struggle with these difficult emotions, I know that I must not let them define me. I must find a way to move beyond these feelings of resentment, to find a way to be happy for those I care about even as I strive for my own personal growth and fulfillment. 

It will not be an easy journey, but I know that I must embark upon it, that I must confront these complicated feelings head-on if I am to find true happiness and contentment in my life.

And so, with a deep breath, I step out of the mundane and into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges and obstacles may lie ahead.
