I am dreaming. The clouds are dark and ominous, a strong gust of wind brushes through my hair as I stand face to face with the person from my past. The sound of waves crashing and seagulls crying fade into the distance as I go down memory lane and experience relive the painful memories they've left with me. 

I look at them with a mix of emotions - anger and rage taking a front seat with a bit of sorrow deep down as the pangs of hurt pierce through my heart and soul. It's been years, yet it feels like a fresh wound that refuses to scar. 

Forgiveness is hard - it's not an easy road to take. It's a choice that no one can force you to make, and it's a choice that only belongs to you. I think about all the times I've wished for this person to acknowledge their wrongdoings, to show remorse and to admit their mistakes. I think about how their actions affected my life and the person I've become. I think about how it's impacted my self-esteem, my belief, my dreams, and my hopes.

As I stand before them, I realize that forgiving them is not for their benefit, but for mine. It's about releasing the heavy weight of grudge and anger that I've carried for far too long. It's about learning to love myself enough to let go of the toxic emotions that have been weighing me down.

I look at them with new eyes, not as my offender, but as a human being who has made mistakes. I see the regret and genuine remorse in their eyes, the sincerity in their voice as they ask for my forgiveness. I see a shattered human being who is broken and lonely, desperate for a chance to make amends.

In this moment of vulnerability, I make a choice. I choose to forgive them, not because they deserve it, but because I deserve it. I deserve the freedom, the peace, and the healing that comes with forgiveness. I deserve the opportunity to move forward and to create a new narrative that's not defined by my past.

With a deep breath, I utter the words, "I forgive you." The moment the words leave my lips, I feel a weight lifting off my shoulders. I feel the shackles of resentment and anger breaking away, releasing me from the chains of bitterness that have bound me for so long.

As I stand before this person, now free from the burdens of the past, I see that forgiveness is not about forgetting what happened, but about remembering it differently. It's not about denying the hurt, but about using it to become stronger. It's not about changing what's done, but about creating a new future.

In this journey of forgiveness, I come to realize that the person who hurt me is also human - a fragile, imperfect, and broken human being who makes mistakes. And in that realization, I find comfort. I find solace in the knowledge that we are all broken, that we are all imperfect, and that we all need forgiveness.

As the dream fades into reality, I am left with a newfound understanding of forgiveness. It's not an easy path, but it's a necessary one. It's a journey that takes courage, strength, and resilience. And in the end, it's a journey that sets us free. I make sure to wake up and apply the lesson to my real life as well. The power of forgiveness is something I will continually apply in my life going forward.
