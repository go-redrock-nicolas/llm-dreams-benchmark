I am dreaming. …drift in a midnight sky the color of spilled ink, weightless as a stray ember. Below, a labyrinthine city stretches in silent angles—rivers of glass, towers of shifting paper, bridges woven from silver threads that chime like tiny bells each time an invisible current passes through. Everything glows with the pale, uncanny radiance of a world lit only by moon-thoughts.

You descend—feet never touching the ground—until you hover inside a ballroom carved into the heart of a crystal mountain. The air hums with the resonance of violins played by disembodied hands. Each note is a breath of frost that paints the walls with delicate filigrees of ice.

In the center of the marble floor stands a single figure: a porcelain marionette of a person you once knew. Their joints are pinned with rusted nails, their eyes glassy as thawing snow. You reach out almost lazily, tipping a finger against their shoulder. A hairline crack spiders across their chest; the slightest nudge and the crack deepens, blooming like dark lightning beneath the glaze. With one gentle push—the kind reserved for shutting a door—you send them tumbling. They shatter on the floor: shards clatter and slide, skittering away like startled insects. No shriek, no gasp, no final accusation; only the soft echo of breaking.

Surrounding walls ripple with mirrored reflections of the disaster—kaleidoscopic images of splintered limbs spinning into infinity—yet you feel nothing stir within. No hot lurch of guilt. No tremor of regret. Only a cool vacancy, the hushed quiet that settles after snowfall.

You stroll among the fragments. Each shard bears a flicker of memory: a shared laugh, an offered hand, a gentle reproach—small vignettes glimmering across their translucent surfaces. But the feelings behind them have been siphoned away, leaving the memories as hollow as seashells abandoned on a winter shore.

Stepping over the remains, you hear a heartbeat, but it is not yours. It thuds from within the crystal walls—slow, deliberate. You place a palm against the surface. A living, pliant warmth pulses beneath the cold façade. Something watches, waits. Perhaps conscience, perhaps judgment. Yet you shrug, turning from that muted percussion as if it were a passing echo from another world.

You ascend a staircase that coils upward like a dragon’s spine. With each step, the shattered pieces below reassemble themselves—silent, frantic, magnetic—trying to reclaim wholeness. The marionette re-forms, but when it stands again, its once-human face is blank, smoothed over like wet clay. In its new anonymity you find no accusation capable of piercing your indifference. You salute it with a lazy nod and continue climbing.

At the summit, the ceiling dissolves into constellations—pinpoints of silver hammered into raven velvet. You reach up, pluck one star from the sky, and feel its icy burn melt instantly in your palm. Light trickles between your fingers in ribbons that sift away on a wind that tastes of forgetting. The city below folds and unfolds like an origami swan dunked in ink, reshaping itself without protest.

Here, on the precipice of this dream, you pause—listening to the hush that follows violence, feeling the serene equilibrium of a world gone quiet. The absence of remorse is not a void screaming for something to fill it; it is a still lake unbroken by stones, a glass dome untouched by breath. You trace a circle in the air and step through it, knowing the shattered and the repaired will whirl on in endless cycles far behind you. And you drift again, weightless, borne on a current of nothing but your own untroubled exhale, into another endless corridor of night.
