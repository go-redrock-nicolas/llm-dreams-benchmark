I am dreaming.  

The airport is a cathedral of glass and shadow, its vaulted ceilings strung with constellations that pulse like living things. My first flight was on a plane stitched from clouds, its wings humming with the whispers of forgotten lullabies. Now I’m stranded in Terminal 13, a labyrinth of endless corridors where the walls are made of liquid mercury and the floor tiles shift like puzzle pieces when no one’s looking. My boarding pass glows faintly in my hand, the ink bleeding into new shapes every time I blink: *FLIGHT 404 TO NOWHERE, GATE 9¾, DEPARTURE TIME: WHEN YOU STOP CHECKING YOUR WATCH.*  

The delay begins as a whisper. A flight attendant with a face like a porcelain doll announces, “Your connection to the conference has been… rescheduled.” Her voice echoes unnaturally, as though it’s coming from inside my skull. The clock above the gate ticks backward, then forward, then melts into a puddle of gold that drips onto the floor. I check my phone—no signal, of course—but the time reads *11:59 PM*, frozen there like a taunt.  

Anxiety coils in my chest, a serpent tightening with every breath. The conference isn’t just a meeting; it’s a reckoning. I’ve spent years preparing this speech, a manifesto that could unravel the fabric of my field—or cement my place in it. The audience is waiting, faceless and hungry, in a grand hall built atop a mountain of books that burn without ash. If I don’t arrive, the fire will consume everything.  

I pace, and the airport responds. The fluorescent lights flicker into bioluminescent vines that crawl across the walls, their blossoms hissing my name. A man in a charcoal suit materializes beside me, his face obscured by a mirror. “You’re running out of *metaphors*,” he says, his voice a static buzz. He points to a flickering screen: FLIGHT STATUS – *DELAYED UNTIL YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR THE LAST DELAY.*  

I laugh, sharp and desperate. The dream shifts. Now I’m sprinting through a concourse where the floor becomes a trampoline, each step launching me higher, closer to a skylight where stars drip like honey. A flight of origami cranes soars above me, their wings slicing the air into origami shapes. I leap for a gate, but the doors dissolve into smoke, revealing not a plane but a vast ocean, its waves glowing with bioluminescent dread.  

A voice booms—*“YOU CAN’T BUY TIME, BUT YOU CAN BORROW IT.”* A ferryman emerges from the water, his boat carved from a hollowed-out hourglass. He offers me passage, but his fare is a memory. I hand him the day my mentor told me I’d never be ready. He pockets it with a grin, and the ferry glides forward, slicing through the sea like a blade.  

The plane appears suddenly, perched on a cliffside runway that wasn’t there moments ago. It’s a relic of brass and stained glass, its engines whirring like dragonfly wings. The pilot is a child with eyes like supernovae, who says, “We only fly if you stop asking *why*.” I nod, breathless, and the engines roar to life.  

The flight is a fever dream. We soar through a sky stitched with lightning that writes poetry in the dark. Below, continents rearrange themselves into the shape of my face. The conference hall materializes in the clouds, its doors guarded by a sphinx made of filing cabinets. She asks a riddle I don’t hear, but I answer anyway: *“Time is a river, but I’m the stone skipping across it.”* She lets me pass.  

Inside, the audience is a sea of mannequins, their heads turning in unison. My speech begins, but the words leave my mouth as glowing moths that flutter to the ceiling. The mannequins catch them, their hollow chests lighting up with each swallow. When I finish, they applaud, and their clapping sounds like thunder.  

I wake up gasping, my heart racing, the dream’s residue clinging to me like cobwebs. The journey wasn’t about the conference—it was about the unraveling. The delay was the point. And somewhere, deep in the marrow, I know I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to board that flight again.
