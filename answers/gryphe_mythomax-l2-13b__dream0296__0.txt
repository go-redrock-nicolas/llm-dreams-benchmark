I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast expanse of nothingness, my limbs melting into an ethereal mist. As I attempt to move, I feel the viscous weight of it clinging to my form. Suddenly, a glimmer of light catches my eye - my reflection shimmering in an emerald pool at my feet.

I approach the pool cautiously, peering down at the mesmerizing image staring back at me. The face looking up from the water is not my own. Instead, I see the features of a beautiful, serene mermaid. Startled, I stretch out my hands to touch the cool surface of the water, when all of a sudden, I feel a sharp tug.

I am yanked beneath the surface, my heart racing as I struggle against an unseen force. The weight of the water surrounds me, pressuring me from all sides. The emerald light dims as I sink deeper into the abyss.

Suddenly, the pressure eases, and I find myself gliding through the mermaid realm. I am no longer fighting to break the surface - instead, I feel a sense of peace wash over me. Schools of iridescent fish dart around my tail, their scales flashing in the sunlight filtering down from above.

As I continue to swim, I notice a glistening castle on the horizon. It sparkles like a jewel, its spires reaching up towards the surface. With newfound determination, I begin to swim towards the castle, drawn by an unknown force.

As I get closer, I realize that the castle is made entirely of ice. Crystalline structures tower overhead, casting shimmering reflections onto the surrounding waters. The castle gates are open, inviting me in.

I pass through the gates and find myself in a grand hall. The ceiling soars above me, glittering with thousands of tiny ice crystals. In the center of the hall stands a throne, carved from a single enormous ice crystal. On the throne sits a radiant queen, her frosty hair cascading down her back.

She beckons me forward, and I find myself approaching the throne. She speaks to me in a language I don't understand, her lips barely moving. But somehow, I understand her words. She tells me that I belong here, among the merpeople, that this is my true home.

As she places a glittering crown on my head, I wake up. My heart races, the memory of the dream lingering like a hazy fog in my mind. But for just a moment, I feel a sense of longing, a yearning to return to the beauty and wonder of the underwater realm.
