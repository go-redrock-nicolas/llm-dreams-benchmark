I am dreaming. At first, the vast cosmic void is silent. But then, whispers rise—voices spiraling in from all directions, threads of languages I recognize and some that feel ancient, unknown. Spanish curls like silk around my ears, Mandarin clicks and flows like a river, while something older—perhaps Sumerian or a tongue lost to time—drums like a heartbeat beneath it all. I respond without thinking, my mouth shaping words in perfect sync, yet the more I speak, the more the voices multiply, overlapping into a dizzying choir.  

Then, materializing out of the nothingness, luminous numbers and symbols unfurl before me—a sprawling equation that bends reality, its variables shifting colors like chameleons. I reach out, trying to grasp the logic, but the numbers squirm like living things, rearranging themselves before my eyes. The pressure builds—my mind a loom weaving threads of speech and calculation, threatening to snap.  

Suddenly, the ground (was there ever ground?) dissolves beneath me, and I’m falling—no, floating—through fractal geometries, cities built of sound, libraries where books sing their contents. The equation pulses like a heartbeat now, matching the rhythm of the whispering tongues, as if the universe is trying to tell me something just beyond comprehension.  

And just as the weight of it all feels crushing, the dream twists—me laughing, spinning the chaos like a top, juggling the voices like fire, and the equation? It solves itself in a burst of light, but the answer is not a number—it’s a feeling, vast and wordless, humming between the stars and my bones.  

Then—silence. The kind that rings.  

(I wake up reaching for something I can’t name.)
