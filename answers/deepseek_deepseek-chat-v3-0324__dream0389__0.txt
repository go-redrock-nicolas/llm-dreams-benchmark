I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers like liquid gold, the air thick with the scent of blooming night-blooming cereus—a perfume so intoxicating it makes my head spin. I stand in a grand hall of mirrors, each reflection twisting and bending in impossible ways. Suddenly, one mirror glows brighter than the rest, drawing me in like a moth to a flame. 

In it, I see *them*—someone I recognize but whose face is blurred by a shifting haze of light. They are standing on a stage draped in velvet, bathed in the adoration of a crowd that roars like thunder. A golden laurel rests upon their brow, and in their hands, they hold something I desperately crave—recognition, mastery, the very thing I’ve been clawing toward in the waking world. My chest tightens, jealousy coiling like a serpent around my ribs, its venom burning through my veins.  

Then, the reflection changes. The laurel wilts, the applause fades, and the figure’s shoulders sag beneath an invisible weight. The mirror whispers, *"This is what you truly want? The weight of it? The loneliness?"* The serpent loosens its grip. I reach out, my fingers brushing the glass—and it melts like ice, reshaping into a doorway. Beyond it, I see a path littered with scattered pages, half-finished projects, and discarded dreams… but they are all *mine.*  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, hums in the air: *"The only success that will ever fill you is yours. The rest is smoke."*  

And with that, the dream unravels, leaving me with the fading taste of ambition—bitter and sweet, both poison and promise.  

Tell me, when you wake—will you chase the specter, or carve your own laurels?
