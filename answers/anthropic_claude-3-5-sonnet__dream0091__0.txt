I am dreaming. As I stand in the enormous glass-domed auditorium, my palms are slick with sweat and my heart thunders against my ribs like a caged bird. The critics' faces before me seem to elongate and distort in my anxiety, their eyes growing impossibly large and owl-like, reflecting the harsh spotlight that beats down on me from above. My creation – a swirling, ever-changing sculpture made of living light and shadow – hovers uncertainly between my trembling hands.

The air grows thick and syrupy, making each movement feel like I'm wading through honey. The critics' notepads transform into writhing serpents of paper, their pens becoming gleaming silver fangs that drip with ink. As I open my mouth to speak, my words turn to butterflies, scattering in a panic before I can catch them.

Suddenly, the floor beneath my feet begins to ripple like disturbed water. The critics start to melt into their chairs, their forms becoming liquid and iridescent, but their eyes – those terrible, judging eyes – remain fixed upon me and my work. The sculpture between my hands pulses with a heartbeat of its own, sending out waves of color that paint the air in impossible hues I've never seen before.

The dome above cracks with a sound like breaking dreams, and instead of glass falling, stars pour in, cascading down around me in a shower of cosmic light. Each star whispers fragments of reviews in ancient languages I somehow understand but cannot speak. My creation starts to sing, a melody that tastes like childhood memories and smells like tomorrow's promises.

The critics are now nothing but pools of shimmering critique, their whispers echoing off walls that no longer exist, as the entire auditorium has transformed into an infinite gallery of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of my artistic soul. I watch as my creation dances between realities, growing stronger with each judgment it absorbs, transforming criticism into pure creative energy...

And then, just as the boundary between artist and art begins to blur, as I start to merge with my own creation...
