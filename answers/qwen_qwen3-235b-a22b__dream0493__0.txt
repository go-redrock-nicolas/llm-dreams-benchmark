I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, glassy lake, its surface so still it mirrors the sky like a forgotten memory. Above, the heavens are not blue but a shifting tapestry of liquid mercury, rippling with constellations that dissolve and reform into shapes—a serpent eating its tail, a key with wings, a face that flickers between your own and someone you’ve never met. The air hums with a low, resonant chord, as though the earth itself is tuning an instrument only you can hear.  

You step forward, though there is no solid ground beneath your feet—only the illusion of it, as if reality is a stage set to test your faith in the mundane. The lake does not resist you; it parts like curtains, revealing a spiral staircase descending into the earth. Each step glows faintly, etched with symbols that shift when you try to focus: a raindrop containing a galaxy, a clock with roots instead of hands, a door that opens into a room you swear you’ve lived in before.  

The deeper you go, the lighter you feel, until you’re floating, then falling, then flying through a cavern lit by bioluminescent trees. Their branches are made of fractals, each twig splitting into smaller versions of itself, and their leaves whisper in a language of pure sensation—grief tastes like cinnamon, joy sounds like the crackle of fire, silence smells of wet stone. You pluck a leaf and it dissolves on your tongue into a memory you’ve never lived: a childhood in a city of floating islands, a lover whose skin shimmers like oil on water, a funeral where everyone dances.  

A figure appears ahead, neither human nor beast but something in between—a stag with antlers of smoke, its eyes twin eclipses. It speaks without moving its mouth, its voice the echo of your own thoughts refracted through a prism. *“You seek the deeper meaning,”* it says, *“but have you asked why the surface exists at all?”*  

Before you can answer, the ground shifts again. Now you’re in a train station where the passengers are made of paper, their pages fluttering as they rush to catch trains that never arrive. A ticket booth sells memories as if they’re snacks—peanut butter jars labeled “First Kiss,” paper bags marked “Regret.” You buy one out of curiosity. When you open it, you’re suddenly *in* the memory: a stranger’s hands trembling as they hold a newborn, the scent of antiseptic and awe, the sound of a heartbeat syncing with another. You gasp, the memory dissolving like ink in water.  

The dream tightens around you, urgent now. You’re in a garden where flowers bloom into tiny, flickering lives—a boy chasing a kite, an old woman knitting a scarf that unravels into stars, a soldier laying down his sword. When you touch a petal, the scene shatters, leaving only a seedpod that whispers, *“Every ordinary moment is a shell. Break it.”*  

Finally, you stand before a door of living ice, its surface etched with your name in a handwriting you don’t recognize. Behind it, you sense the answer to everything—the why of hunger, the music of decay, the reason light exists only because darkness permits it. But the door has no handle, no keyhole. Only a question burned into the frost:  

**“Are you ready to unsee the world as you know it?”**  

You raise your hand. The moment stretches. And then—  

*The dream stops.*  

You wake up, the echo of the question still vibrating in your bones, the faint taste of the leaf-memory on your tongue, and the unsettling certainty that the deepest truths aren’t hidden… they’re *waiting*, patient as the dark, for you to stop looking and simply *be*.
