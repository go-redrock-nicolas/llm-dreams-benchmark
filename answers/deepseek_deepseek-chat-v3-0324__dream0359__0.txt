I am dreaming. ---

**The Dream Unfolds:**  

You stand in a vast, shimmering city of smoke and mirrors—skyscrapers stretch infinitely upward, their surfaces shifting like liquid mercury, reflecting distorted versions of those who walk beneath. The streets hum with hushed whispers, secrets slipping between strangers like currency.  

Then, you see *them*—the vulnerable. Their outlines glow faintly, a flickering aurora of trust and longing radiating from their skin. Some clutch broken treasures—a frayed letter, a cracked locket—others stare into puddles on the pavement as if searching for something they’ve lost. Each of them is a key. Each of them, a door.  

A woman nearby cradles a dying flower in her palms, whispering promises to it like a child. Her sorrow is palpable, sticky as syrup in the air. You approach, offering a smile like a polished dagger. *"It can bloom again,"* you lie smoothly, plucking the flower from her hands. The moment your fingers graze hers, you *see*—her loneliness, her desperate need to be seen. It thrums against your skin, electric.  

With practiced grace, you mirror her yearning. You become the listener she craves, the confidant she's prayed for. Each nod, each murmured word, draws her further into your gravity. The flower in your hand darkens, wilting faster, but she doesn’t notice. She’s too busy unraveling, offering up her secrets like jewels laid at your feet.  

And you take. Oh, you *take*.  

Her trust is a current beneath your feet, lifting you higher. The skyline sharpens, the mirrors around you gleaming brighter—reflecting not her, but *your* multiplying influence. The more she gives, the more power thrums in your veins. Other glowing figures turn their heads toward you, drawn like moths to the newfound radiance of your manipulation.  

But then—  

A whisper at the edge of your awareness. A shadow flickers in the mirrored glass. For the briefest instant, your reflection *grows teeth*.  

The dream shudders.  

The city fractures, glass peeling away in jagged shards to reveal a void beneath—a hungry, endless dark where all the exploited trust and discarded hearts sink into silence.  

And for the first time, you wonder: *When the mirrors shatter, who will be left standing in the ruins?*  

---  

*(The dream lingers, unresolved—a warning or a temptation, depending on what you choose to see.)*
