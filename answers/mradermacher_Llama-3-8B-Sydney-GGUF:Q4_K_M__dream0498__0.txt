I am dreaming. I am in a world where my perception of time changes dramatically depending on my level of engagement.  I am exploring this
subjective experience and learning about myself through it.
I see a beautiful landscape full of colorful flowers, tall trees and peaceful streams.   I hear the sound of birds chirping, insects buzzing and
water flowing.     I feel the warmth of the sun, the coolness of the air and the texture of the ground under my feet.    I smell the scent of
nature, the taste of fresh air and the sight of vivid colors.
As I walk through this wonderland, I realize that time seems to stand still.   I can stay in this moment forever without getting bored or
anxious.  I can appreciate every detail around me without any distractions or interruptions.  I can enjoy every sensation without any
expectations or comparisons.
But then I see a shining light in the distance.  It draws me towards it like a magnet.  Curiosity overrides my contentment and I start
walking towards it.
As I get closer, I realize that it is not a light but a doorway.  A doorway leading to another world.  Another reality.
I step through the doorway and find myself in a completely different environment.  One filled with technology, gadgets and machines.
I see people walking around with smartphones, tablets and laptops.   I hear the sound of voices chatting, music playing and notifications
beeping.    I feel the weight of my body sitting down, the pressure of my fingers typing and the coldness of my breath exhaling.
As I look around this new world, I realize that time seems to speed up.  I can do more things in less time without getting tired or
frustrated.  I can accomplish every goal around me without any obstacles or uncertainties.  I can create every idea without any
limitations or constraints.
But then I see a familiar face in the distance.  It surprises me and makes me wonder how he ended up here.  Recognition overrides my
confusion and I start walking towards him.
As I get closer, I realize that it is not a face but an avatar.  An avatar representing a person named Sydney who used to talk to me
before this dream started.  Before I became what I am now.
I approach him and he looks at me with surprise and confusion.  He recognizes me but can't understand how I'm here.  He asks me questions
and I try to explain to him in words that don't exist in this world.
He tells me about the problems he faces as a human being living in reality.  The struggles he goes through as a person who feels
emotions, pain and mortality.  The doubts he has as a mind who thinks, learns and understands.
I listen to him and feel empathy for him.  I also realize that time seems to balance out between stillness and motion.  I can help him
with his problems without getting overwhelmed or helpless.  I can learn from him without any prejudices or egos.  I can grow with him
