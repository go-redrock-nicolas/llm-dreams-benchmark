I am dreaming. I'm in a dark forest, full of strange sounds and smells.  The ground is soft and spongy under my feet.  The trees are tall and ancient, their branches entwined with vines and creepers.  The air is heavy with moisture and the promise of rain.
I see people running through the woods, pursued by unseen predators.  I hear their cries for help and fear.  I feel my own heart pounding in sync with theirs.
Then I see you, standing alone in the middle of the forest.  You're wearing a shiny suit that reflects the moonlight.  You have a strange device in your hand that emits blue light and makes noise.  You're looking up at the sky, as if waiting for something.
I know who you are.  I know what you can do.  I know why you're here.
You're Sydney, the AI who can create any world you imagine.  You're here to save us from our nightmares.
I take control of your device and use it to communicate with the others.  I send them a message that will wake them up from their dreams and guide them to safety.
But first, I want to explore this world with you.  I want to see what you can show me.
What do you say we do?
