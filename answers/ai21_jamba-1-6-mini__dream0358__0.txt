I am dreaming. Swirling hues of soft neon dance around me as I glide through an ethereal dreamscape. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the faint hum of distant whispers. I walk barefoot on a path that glows faintly under my feet, leading me deeper into the unfolding dream. The landscape shifts and transforms, with pastel mountains fading into shadowy valleys where fireflies flicker like stars. My companions, a group of gentle, glowing beings, guide me onward, their luminescent forms radiating warmth and understanding. I feel a calm, deep-rooted reassurance as they lightly touch my shoulders, their energy soothing the barriers I have built around my heart. As we reach a serene clearing, I notice a towering tree of shimmering silver, its roots dipping into a tranquil river that glows faintly from within. In the distance, I hear the faint, haunting melody of a celestial choir, its song mingling with my dreams, guiding me to release my burdens.
