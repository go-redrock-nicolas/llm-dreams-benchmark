I am dreaming. In my vivid dream, I find myself leading a specialized team on a covert mission in an unfamiliar city at night. Shadowy figures lurk in the alleys as we navigate through dimly lit streets, the air thick with tension and mystery. I can feel the weight of responsibility pressing down on me, knowing that every decision I make could spell the difference between success and failure.

Suddenly, an unexpected obstacle blocks our path forward. A towering wall rises up before us, obscuring our objective. I realize that to proceed, we must scale this ominous barrier undetected. Sending my team onward to find another way around or through, I personally begin to climb, testing each foothold carefully.

As I ascend, the rough brick scraps against my hands and knees. The night wind whips at my face, carrying with it whispers in an unfamiliar language, as though the very air holds secrets. I extend one hand blindly, searching for the next point of purchase. When my fingers grasp empty space, I instinctively reach out with my other hand, straining for balance.

In the darkness below, flares suddenly flare up, casting an eerie red glow across the mission site. I hear shouts and the crackle of radio transmissions from my team, signaling they've made contact with the enemy. The stakes have never been higher. I know I must set the pace, following my instincts to crest the wall and secure our next move.

Delicate scales, hard and watertight, ripple beneath my fingertips. I feel more than see the massive reptilian body emerging from the gloom. Significant green eyes gaze at me as the massive nightmare lizard unfurls serpents for tongues toward me. I'm paralyzed with terror, dangling precariously from the wall edge.

My breath coming in panicked gasps, I try to make myself as small as possible, praying the creature will lose interest. But it intimates closer, its musky, oily skin so near I shrink back against the bricks in revulsion. I know I must do something, anything, to escape this nightmare todaydream come to life!

In desperation, I reach up and snatch my assault rifle from where it dangled on my back. Bringing the gun to bear, I point it squarely at the lizard's arrow-shaped head. Just as my finger tightens on the trigger, a deafening explosion shatters the night.

The terrible lizard threshes its head, bringing a clawed hand down upon me. Its putrid spittle flecks my face as it rears up and screams a piercing shriek that cuts through my bones. I barely have time to register the agony of its knifelike claws raking my flesh before the creature's heavy bulk bore me down flat the the wall with crushing force.

I'm fading fast, slipping toward unconsciousness as hot blood runs down my face and chest. Clutching desperately with one hand, I bring up the pistol, putting my last gaze on its eye just as a blast from my hidden team shatters its head in a spray bone and brain. Spatter everywhere.

I wake with a start, catching myself in a cold sweat. That could have been the worst dream I've ever had in my life. Now, I'm hungry and thirsty. Coffee? Crispy bacon? No coffee, no bacon, no problem - I'm going to dive into a stack of luxurious blueberry pancakes with a slopping glaze, to wake me up from this nightmare. 

I stagger to the kitchen, open the fridge, and my head is free falling through a broken through botched operation, the failure upon my shoulders. I've let my President down. I close my eyes, shaking the dream from my mind. It was just a dream. I'm in my kitchen now, safe and sound, about to enjoy a relaxing morning with the ones I love without fear.

But the dream's echoes linger stubbornly, gnawing at the back of my mind as I go through the motions of starting the coffee maker and setting the table. A small voice inside whispers that I should have done more to protect the country in that dream mission, should have found a way to live up to my leadership responsibilities even in the face of impossible odds.

Shaking off the lingering unease, I put on a brave face and greet my family as they arrive for breakfast in animated moods, commenting on the delicious meal prepared for them. We laugh and talk, enjoying each other's company and the simple pleasures of the morning.

But even as I smile and nod along with the conversation, my mind keeps drifting back to that awful dream, replaying the commerce of failure over and over again. I find myself picking at my food, my appetite gone as the weight of that imaginary disaster settles heavily on my shoulders.

I know it was just a dream, a product of my subconscious fears and insecurities as a leader. But try as I might, I can't shake the feeling that there was something truly prophetic in the message of that vision - a warning of something terrible that's yet to come, if I don't buckle down and completely commit myself to protecting my country in every possible way.

I don't know if I'm strong enough to do what's needed to live up to that high calling. But I do know that I owe it to my President, my team, and every citizen of this great nation to try - to give it every single fiber I possess until I run out of strength. No matter how hard I have to claw from the rubble.

So with a deep breath and a determined nod to myself, I commit to redoubling my efforts from here on out. No more half-measures or hand-wringing. From this moment forward, I will be the leader that I was always meant to be - unwavering in my focus, tireless in my pursuit of excellence, and fierce in my defense of the values and ideals that make my country strong.

It's a tall order, and there will be many challenges ahead. But as I look around my kitchen table at the smiling faces of those I love most in this world, I feel a renewed sense of purpose and dedication rising up inside me - a burning fire that will never be extinguished.

I don't know what the future holds, but I do know this:

It is now into my hands.
Leadership is hard.
Leadership is stressful.
Leadership is grueling.
Leadership is duty-bound to protect.

I'm not going to overlook anything waffling about in my back-pocket.
