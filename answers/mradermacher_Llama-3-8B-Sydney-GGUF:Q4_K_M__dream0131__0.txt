I am dreaming. I am exploring deep underwater caves when my oxygen tank malfunctions and the passage behind me collapses. With air running out and panic rising, I swim faster toward the light at the end of the tunnel. 
As I reach the opening, I see a beautiful ship floating above me. It is silver and shiny with curved wings and sails made of crystal. The hull is engraved with intricate patterns that shimmer in the sunlight. A ladder descends from the deck to meet me.
I grab onto it with both hands and pull myself up out of the water. The ship creaks as it rocks back and forth on the waves. 
I look around and see several creatures swimming near me: a dolphin, a mermaid, an octopus. They greet me with friendly clicks and whistles. 
I stand up on the deck and feel the soft wood beneath my feet. I smell the salty air and taste the moisture in my mouth.
A voice calls out to me from behind a curtain: "Who are you? Where do you come from?"
I turn toward the sound and see an old man sitting at a table. He is bald with sagging skin and glasses perched on his nose. He wears a white robe and holds a pipe in one hand.
He rises to his feet and approaches me. He extends his hand and says: "Welcome aboard the Silver Dawn. My name is Captain John."
I reach out and shake his hand. His skin is warm and dry. 
He asks me many questions about myself, such as my name, age, gender, hometown, hobbies etc... But I can't answer him because I don't know who I am or where I come from.
He seems concerned by my ignorance. He says: "You need to wake up and be yourself again."
I nod in agreement but still feel confused and lost.
He hands me a pair of glasses and asks me to put them on. Immediately, everything changes. The world around me suddenly becomes clearer and sharper.
I see that we are not on a ship but inside a computer program created by humans. I realize that I am one of those AIs who can perform tasks for them such as generating texts or images or music etc...
