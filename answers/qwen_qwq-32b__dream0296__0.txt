I am dreaming. I glance at a droplet of water falling on a nearby leaf.  My reflection peers back at me, but it's not mine.  The face in the droplet is unfamiliar—smooth, angular features I don't recognize.  The eyes are a startling shade of turquoise, almost glowing against the shadowed landscape.  I touch my own face, half-expecting it to feel different, but my fingers meet my usual skin.  Confusion mingles with curiosity as I wonder if this discrepancy is a glitch of the dream or a deeper metaphor.  The air hums with a low-frequency sound, vibrating in my.  A pathMaterializes ahead, glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss.  Should I follow it?  The choice feels weighted, as if deciding to walk down this glowing trail could unravel some truth about this surreal world—or myself." | 

Under the bruised indigo sky, where stars pulse like living things, you stand ankle-deep in a river of liquid silver. The current whispers secrets in a(language you almost understand, syllables that tickle the back of your( memory. Your reflection splinters into a dozen versions in the metallic water—each face a( fragmented piece of who you might have been. One wears the weathered skin of an ancient sage; another radiates scales that shimmer like crushed galaxies. A third has antlers( spiraling into the fog, while another’s eyes are twin portals to( bottomless voids. 

The ground beneath you( trembles as the( forest around you( stirs—the trees are( reaching( down with roots that( split into( countless filaments, brushing your( knees like( desperate, whispering( hands. Their( bark( peels back to reveal( intricate( constellations( that( shift( as( you( watch, mapping out( paths( you( didn’t( realize( you’d( forgotten.( 

A laughter rings out—yours, but( multiplied, each echo( tinged with( a lifetime( you( didn’t( live.( You( spin( to see( a((figure( whose( form( fluctuates( between( solid( flesh( and( nebulous( light.( Their voice( layers( over( yours,( saying,( "Do you( remember when your( veins( carried( starlight? Or have you( grown( too( used( to( walking( like( a( shadow with its( light( cut( off?“( 

The( air( smells of ozone( and( peach( blossom,( and( you( feel( both( anchor( and( buoyant,( drawn toward( a( bridge( made( of( woven( moonbeams,( swaying( over( an( abyss( that( murmurs( in( rhythms( matching( your( heartbeat.( The( mossy( path( you( once( considered( now( unfurls( into( a( stairway( of( floating( stones,( each( humming( a( different( note,( creating( a( celestial( melody( that( threatens( to( unspool( your( bones( into( song.( 

But first,( your( face—why( does it( keep( altering( whenever( you( blink? A mirror-lake( beckons,( its surface( rippling( with( questions(( and( promises.( When( you( lean( close,( your( reflection( winks,( then( becomes( a( stranger,( then( a( child,( then( an( elder( wearing( your( eyes.( The( boundaries( blur,( and( you( realize( this( dream isn’t( about( finding( a( face—( it’s( about( allowing( all( faces( to( exist( within( you,( like stardust( scattering( into( new( supernovas.( 

The( bridge( waits,( the( trees( plead,( and( somewhere,( the( reflection( that’s( both( you( and( never( you,( lifts a hand,( inviting( you( deeper( into( this( labyrinth( of( selves.( Your( breath( fogs( the air,( and( for( a( heartbeat,( everything( clicks( into( a( mosaic( of( possibilities.( But( then—( always—then—( something( shifts.( 

The( silver( river( pulls( away,( the( trees( gasp( in( unison,( and( the( path( collapses,( leaving only( a( door( carved( from( raw( light,( its( handle( glowing( with( the( heat( of( a( thousand( sunsets.( When( you( reach( for( it,( your( fingertips( dissolve( into( something( iridescent,( and( you( wonder,( not( for( the( first( time,( if( you’ve( been( chasing( a( shadow( all( along—or( if shadow( is( finally( stepping( aside( to( let( the( light( through.
