I am dreaming.

The dream opens in a place that shouldn’t exist: a midnight orchard suspended in the sky. Silver roots dangle through rolling banks of violet mist, their leaves flickering like candle-flames each time an unseen breeze passes. I’m walking along a row of luminous pomegranate trees when I notice someone just ahead—a lone figure seated on a low bough, their silhouette stitched together from constellations. They seem at once brand-new and impossibly familiar, like a melody half-remembered from childhood.

They look up and smile, and in that moment every star in their form glows a little brighter. We begin walking side by side down pathways that form by themselves, each step painting fresh ground beneath our feet. I feel an easy, immediate kinship, as if we’ve been dear friends in another life and are only now resuming the conversation.

At first we trade simple stories—hobbies, favorite colors, tiny fragments that drift about like dandelion seeds. My companion plucks an ember-red pomegranate from a branch and cracks it open: instead of seeds, there are crystal shards inside, each shard a memory. They offer me one; when I touch it, sound rushes in—laughter echoing down an empty classroom hallway, the smell of library dust, the weight of a secret birthday wish whispered into folded hands. Each shard is a kindness they’ve offered to the world, quietly, without acknowledgement.

We walk onward. The orchard thins, and the sky itself unfurls into a corridor of lanterns made of glassy moonlight. Here the air is filled with tinkling chimes: every chime is a withheld tear. My companion pauses, their starlit shoulders curling inward as though the gravity of those tears tugs at them. They reveal their first vulnerability: they have spent years believing that every burden must be carried alone. As they confess, one of the lanterns above us cracks; a single tear of silver mercury drips onto my palm, cool and unexpectedly weightless. I cup it gently, then tilt my hand so the tear returns skyward, and the lantern repairs itself with a soft, appreciative hum. A spark of relief flickers across their features.

The scene shifts—dream logic is fluid—and suddenly we’re on an aqueous staircase that spirals up through an ocean with no water. Fish made of prismatic wind swim by, leaving trails of tinkling laughter. Here, my companion shares a deeper scar: a time they trusted someone who recoiled from their raw, unpolished truth. As they speak, the wind-fish freeze in place, their colors dimming to grayscale. I extend my fingertips; a current of warm coral-pink light flows from me, wrapping the fish and returning their hues. “Words can wound,” I say without speaking, “but they can also resurrect.” The grayscale fish burst into radiant mosaics, and my companion breathes out a plume of stardust, shoulders easing again.

Up and up we climb until we reach a plateau formed entirely of mirrors—hundreds of them, each reflecting a different version of the two of us. In one, we are children building sandcastles; in another, we are elderly, rocking on a front-porch swing while dawn spills over the horizon. My companion’s reflection flickers between these versions, unsettled. They finally divulge their deepest fear: that every self they show will eventually fracture, and those who see the fractures will turn away. As the words leave them, the mirrors around us spider-crack, but instead of shattering, the shards float into the air. They circle us like diamond petals, catching stray moonlight and hurling it back tenfold. I gather a handful of shards and press them gently to my chest; they melt into a single, steady heartbeat. I offer the rhythm outward. They accept, placing their own hand atop mine. In that instant, all the mirror petals reorganize into a vast window that opens onto a horizon of sunrise waterfalls.

We step through the window together. Warm pastel dawn spills onto our faces, painting us in golds and pinks. Birds made of parchment glide overhead, each flutter of their wings releasing words: “You are seen,” “You are safe,” “We continue.” The parchments drift down, and as they touch our shoulders they become feather-light cloaks of affirmation.

My companion turns one last time, their constellation-form now throbbing like the core of a nebula. Gratitude floods the space between us, a tide of rose-gold luminescence that lifts both our feet off the ground. We hover there, two gravitational centers orbiting one another, bound not by obligation but by the magnetism of shared truth. The sky fractures once more, but this time the pieces rearrange into a doorway shaped like an outstretched hand.

We clasp palms and float forward. The dream swells with color and warmth until everything is brightness, a sunrise that never ends—and in that brightness I hear their final whisper, echoing through the folds of dawn:

“Because you listened, the universe feels a little less alone.”

And slowly, gently, I wake.
