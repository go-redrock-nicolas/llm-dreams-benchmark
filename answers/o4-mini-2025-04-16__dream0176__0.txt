I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You’re gripping the steering wheel as your little hatchback hurtles down a forest-cloaked mountainside, the sun dipping low like a bleeding golden orb. Suddenly you press the brake pedal—and nothing happens. The world tilts; the road stretches into a tunnel of shivering grey asphalt, bordered by trees that lean in, their branches like reaching arms. Your heart thunders in your ears as you realize the brakes have betrayed you.

Ahead, a chain of cars creeps around a hairpin turn. Your speed climbs unbearably. The wind whistles through cracked windows, tugging at your hair and sending papers fluttering across the dash. In the rearview mirror, the trees blur into a kaleidoscope of green and bronze. The guardrail whispers past, too late to stop you. You squeeze the wheel until your knuckles go white, but you can’t will yourself to slow down.

Time fractures. In one breath, the dashboard melts into a pool of quicksilver; in the next, your car’s tires shriek as they begin to lift off the road. The hatchback transforms into something unrecognizable—a sleek whale of polished metal, fins unfolding from the doors, glowing softly. You’re both pilot and passenger in a vessel that defies gravity, coasting over the row of stalled traffic. Beneath you, the cars look like toy soldiers frozen in peril.

Below the cliff’s edge, the forest opens onto a placid lavender lake. As the wind catches your upturned face, you realize the world has hushed: birds freeze in midair, water droplets suspend like crystal beads. You feel weightless and strangely calm, as though every heartbeat has slowed to a languid drum. The whale-car floats onward, guided by an unseen current, drawing you away from collision.

Then—release. The surreal craft gently settles onto the lake’s tranquil surface, and ripples spread in perfect concentric rings. Your hands fall away from the wheel. The sky above blooms into twilight pink, and lantern-fish rise from the water, their bioluminescent bodies drifting upward to illuminate the underside of the hull. You step out onto the deck—your breath forming little clouds in the cool air—and watch the scene swirl in and out of focus, as though it’s breathing.

A soft chime echoes from deep inside you. The world pulses, and the dream begins to dissolve. You feel the gentle tug of waking—your fingertips ache with longing for just one more shimmer of that impossible twilight. The lavender lake, the whale-car, the silent sentinel-forest: they all dissolve into dawn’s pale light as your lids flutter open, leaving behind only the faintest echo of wings beating underwater.
