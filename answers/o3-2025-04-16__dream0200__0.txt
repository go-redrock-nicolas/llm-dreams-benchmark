I am dreaming. …inhale a breath that tastes like sunlight and stardust, and the dream unfurls around me.

I stand on the edge of an impossible amphitheater carved into the inner curve of a crescent moon. Its marble tiers float unsupported in violet space, yet I feel solid ground beneath my boots—a nimbus of pale-blue light that pulses gently with every heartbeat. Below me spreads a cosmic sea, dark and glossy, flecked with drifting lantern-constellations. Each lantern holds a tiny scene from my life: a childhood triumph, a midnight failure, a laugh so old it has turned sepia. They bob on the waves like fireflies in slow motion, whispering memories I almost recognize.

Above, the sky changes temperature rather than color: it warms like sunrise when courage swells, cools like twilight when doubt creeps in. Somewhere between those shifting atmospheres hangs the Test—a living sigil of my life’s goal, suspended twenty paces ahead. For years I have chased this dream: to compose a work of art so luminous it stitches together every broken fragment of myself and leaves a melody ringing through the hearts of strangers long after my own time falters. The sigil has taken shape as a kaleidoscopic instrument, equal parts violin, telescope, and fountain pen, its strings humming with still-to-be-written notes. To reach it, I must cross a bridge made entirely of sound.

The first step lands on a chord—C-minor, thunderous and warm. It ripples outward, creating the next plank of the bridge. The second step summons an F-major that glitters like frost. The bridge builds itself note by note beneath my soles. Behind me the amphitheater audience appears: blurred silhouettes of every mentor, skeptic, mentor-turned-skeptic, and skeptic-turned-friend who ever peered over my shoulder while I chased this dream. Their faces glow lantern-soft, eyes an orchestra of hopes and fears in equal measure.

Halfway across, a crosswind of hush sweeps through, and the bridge dissolves into shards of silence. I hover for a heartbeat—literally, one resonant thump in my chest—and begin to fall toward the cosmic sea. But the memory-lanterns rise up like steppingstones, offering scenes I’ve tried to forget: the night I almost quit, the letter of rejection folded sharp as origami sorrow, the recital where my hands shook too hard to finish. I set my weight on each painful lantern and it burns away the shame, transmuted into clear tone, rebuilding the bridge.

At the final plank, the sigil flares open like a many-petaled comet. I place my hands on its strings—one hand is suddenly eleven years old and trembling with first inspiration; the other is the aging hand I will one day use to steady a grandchild’s chin. Between them sparks a chord I’ve never named. The amphitheater turns inside out, and the sky becomes a sweeping staff of infinite measures. Stars rearrange into notes, meteors into rests, black holes into whole-note punctuations.

I draw the cosmic bow, its hair woven from every sunrise I’ve ever witnessed, and play. The melody begins as a question mark, curves into possibility, then resolves into the steady, unbreakable shape of my own spine. Each phrase writes itself in silver along the throat of space, and as the final cadence lands—a luminous, suspended E that lasts exactly as long as my longest-held breath—the entire dream hushes.

Silence is not empty here; it is pregnant, luminous. In that silence the faces in the amphitheater lean forward. A single tear made of melted nebula rolls down one stranger’s cheek; it falls, becomes a new star, and orbits the melody like a faithful moon. Then the sigil dissolves into embers that float into my chest, branding the achievement onto the inner wall of my ribs where no doubt can smudge it.

The amphitheater, the sea, the bridge—all fold into morning light. I feel my eyelids flutter in another world, but just before waking I hear the echo of my own voice spoken back to me by the dream itself:

“You have played your heart into existence. Remember the sound of its truth.”

I carry that resonance out of sleep like a priceless tuning fork, still vibrating, ready to strike the waking world with music.
