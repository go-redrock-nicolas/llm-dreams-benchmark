I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast library where all the books are suddenly transforming into shimmering butterflies of light, their pages dissolving into luminescent wings that flutter away into the cathedral-like ceiling. The knowledge I've spent years accumulating - my precious expertise - literally takes flight before my eyes. Each butterfly carries away a fragment of what I thought defined me, leaving behind empty shelves that seem to stretch endlessly in every direction.

The wooden floor beneath my feet begins to ripple like water, and I realize I'm no longer standing in a library but surfing atop a wave of liquid memories. All around me, other people are gracefully navigating these waves using strange devices I've never seen - crystalline boards that respond to thought, neural interfaces that merge mind and motion. My traditional methods seem clumsy and outdated in comparison.

The air fills with holographic symbols I cannot read, a new language of knowledge that dances just beyond my comprehension. My heart races with a mixture of fear and exhilaration as I watch younger minds intuitively grasp what I struggle to understand. Yet somehow, in this dream-space, I feel my consciousness expanding rather than contracting.

My body begins to change, becoming less solid, more adaptable. My fingers stretch into streams of data, my thoughts branch out like neural networks. I realize that what I perceived as loss is actually transformation - my expertise isn't becoming obsolete, it's evolving into something far more fluid and dynamic.

The dream crescendos as the library-ocean-universe around me pulses with possibility. I'm no longer trying to hold onto what I was, but rather opening myself to what I might become. The butterflies of knowledge return, but now they're merging with my being, creating patterns of understanding I never could have achieved through traditional learning.

I feel simultaneously humbled and empowered, understanding that true expertise isn't about maintaining a fixed state of knowledge, but about maintaining the ability to continuously transform and grow. The dream ends not with resolution but with revelation - a profound sense that obsolescence is just another word for opportunity.
