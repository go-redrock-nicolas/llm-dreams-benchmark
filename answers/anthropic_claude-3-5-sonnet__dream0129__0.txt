I am dreaming. As I cross the threshold of an ancient stone building covered in phosphorescent moss, I feel a gentle warmth emanating from within. The sanctuary's interior is a vast circular chamber with a soaring domed ceiling that seems to breathe – expanding and contracting ever so slightly with a soft azure glow. Scattered throughout the space are people sitting on cushions made of what appears to be woven moonlight, their faces both familiar and strange, as faces often are in dreams.

The walls pulse with living memories – shimmering like oil on water – and I notice that each person's shadow stretches toward the center of the room, intertwining with the others to form an intricate mandala pattern on the floor. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and night-blooming jasmine.

When it comes time to share, I feel my heart begin to race, but then something extraordinary happens: as I open my mouth to speak, my words become visible – glowing butterflies of indigo and gold that flutter from my lips. Each butterfly carries a fragment of my pain, my story, my truth. As they dance through the air, others' butterflies join mine, creating a swirling constellation of shared experiences.

I watch in awe as my most vulnerable moment transforms into these luminous creatures, and rather than feeling exposed, I feel profoundly connected. The other participants' eyes reflect the same light that's within me, and their own stories emerge as different colored butterflies – some deep crimson, others emerald green, each carrying its own weight of memory and healing.

The combined light from our story-butterflies begins to coalesce near the ceiling, forming a gently rotating galaxy of shared trauma and resilience. As it spins, I feel lighter, as if each revolution is slowly unraveling years of tightly wound pain. The boundaries between individual experiences blur until we are all part of one cosmic tapestry of healing, our separate stories now threads in a larger, more beautiful whole.

In this dream state, I understand that vulnerability isn't just about exposing our wounds – it's about allowing them to transform into something that can take flight, something that can help light the way for others who are still finding their path through the darkness.

The scene begins to fade like watercolors running down a canvas, but the warmth and connection linger, even as consciousness starts to creep in around the edges of this healing dreamscape...
