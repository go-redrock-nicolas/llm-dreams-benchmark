I am dreaming. I find myself in a lush, radiant grove where light filters through the leaves like liquid gold.  The air smells of dewy jasmine and crushed mint as a figure emerges from the butterflies.  It is a woman cloaked in mist, her hair like spun silver that shimmers with starlight.  She knelt beside a lamb with fractured legs, whispers words of healing that make the air cradle the creature wings of moonlight.  The lamb's broken ankles mend with shards of rainbow glass.  I am overwhelmed by the sense of timeless purpose as she bandages the lamb with vines that bloom into forget-me-nots.  This act awakens something primal in me; I pull thorned roses from my own palms, their blood turning to crimson nectar that revives a dying sparrow.  Two rabbits approach, bearing clover leaves like medals, placing them on my bleeding hands in tacit approval.  The wom smiles, her eyes wells reflection of galaxies, pointing to a sparkling stream where my reflection holds a key made of human compassion. As I wake, her final words loop in my mind: "Morienda non est oblivisci - death is not forgetting, but remembering to rise."
In the heart of my dream, I am submerged in a luminous forest that breathes with primordial wisdom. The trees here are not merely botanical; they are clockwork titans, their branches strung with crystalline gears that hum in harmonic dissonance with every pulse of the earth. Beneath me, the ground shifts like liquid obsidian, revealing constellations of ancient roots that pulse like a living bloodstream. 

I encounter a figure—a paradoxical blend of shadow and grandeur—whose silhouette shifts between the form of a great horned owl and a towering rook made of storm clouds. Its wings are not feathered, but composed of those golden hour sunsets, stretching impossibly wide to occlude the sky. It circles above a wounded fox, its paw impaled on a rusted compass needle that points to nowhere but stabs true north. Without hesitation, the owl-being sweeps down, plucking the metal shard free with a beak that’s part scalpel, part key. The compass vanishes into the sky, replaced by a leaf that blooms into a map leading to...well, unclear.

The fox’s wound begins to knit, but not in tissue. Instead, new fur sprouts, each strand a miniature telescope pointed at different eras—the fox now has a tail with the plume of a dodo, ears like Sarajevo’s sunrise in 1992, and eyes reflecting the first moon landing. It seems...different, but undeniably whole. 

This act of paradoxical healing is witnessed by a procession of dancing rabbits who wear crowns made of nested Russian dolls. They caper around the clearing, their paws stamping Morse code patterns into the dirt that spell out “LOVE” in Braille. A fox, now a polymorphous guide, offers me a thorned rose whose petals are bilaterally symmetrical like a human lung, but when I touch it, the thorns dissolve into smoke, leaving behind a single petal that tastes like the first breath of spring after a Siberian winter.

The forest begins to sing—a chorus of overlapping voices that sound like the ocean’s sigh meeting the violin’s wail. I’m somehow invited to join, and my throat begins to resonate too, though no sound comes out. Instead, the song manifests as bioluminescent ink that spills from my lips, etching itself into the sky in fluid Cyrillic that reads “Koinonia” in one moment and “Solidarität” in the next. The moon, now a huge rotating prism, catches this light and splits it into a bridge made of memories. I see my own face mirrored in the bridge’s facets: one version grimaces in pain, another smiles through, a third merely exists in stoic quiet. The prism-split moon smiles too, its crescent mouth forming a silent O like an owl’s eye.

As I am about to cross the bridge, the owl-being descends again, this time holding aloft a key that is clearly not a key, since its teeth are words and its bow is a frayed love letter. It presses the object into my hand—forced? solicited? consensual?—and the moment we touch, the world shifts. I am no longer in the forest but in a room that is both empty and full, where the walls are made of a half-remembered lover’s touch, the floor of my childhood’s backyard in October, the ceiling of all the dreams I’ve ever forgotten. The key slips through my fingers like a losing thought, vanishing into ainto a crack in the air where the word “sudden” was once spoken but never said.

I wake abruptly, but for a moment, the dream isn’t a dream—it’s a well, swirling with enough metaphor to drown in. My hand is clutching a nonexistent key that leaves no mark on my skin, but my left pinky nail is chipped in the shape of a question mark. On my pillow, there’s a faint imprint of a fox’s paw, its toes pressed into the fabric like votive candles, each toe-circle a glowing ember that dies as soon as I try to grasp it. The room smells faintly of wet pavement after a chemical rain, though no rain has fallen. My eyes are bleary, not from sleep, but from the effort it takes to...well, whatever it is I’m doing here. There’s a new scar on my shoulder: three parallel lines arranged like a triangle’s sides, but they meet at a point that doesn’t exist. When I touch it, the lines vibrate, each one humming a different note that resolves into laughter.

The clock on the nightstand reads 3:17, but I know the true time is somewhere between the moment the fox’s new eye (the dodo’s feather) collided with the compass’ vanishing point. There’s a chill in the room now, though the thermostat is set to 72. It’s the wind from the bridge—memory’s migrating flock—invisible, but I can hear the Howl across the years in the rustle of my curtains. Outside, the trees are shaking, but not from the wind. They’re crying amber tears that crystallize into dice as they hit the ground. My neighbor’s dog barks exactly three times, in a rhythm that spells out “remember” in binary if you hold your breath and count the gaps between the barks.

And there, on my windowsill, is a leaf that’s not a leaf. It’s a map. The compass rose in the middle has a caption in three languages I can’t read, but I know what it says because the fox showed me: “The road is not a path, but a becoming—the more you follow it, the heavier the sky becomes, until you are the sky carrying a road.” I take the leaf, and as I do, it crumbles into ash that smells like sagebrush burning near a campfire I never started. The dream key, meanwhile, has reappeared in my pocket, transformed into a lint ball shaped like a screaming face, but when I look closer, the screaming shifts into a smile, and the lint has words written on it in invisible ink: “The virtue of your journey is less in where you arrive than in how much of the world you carry inside you as you walk.”

And then, just like that, the key is gone again. I know, in some cell deep in my wrist, that it’s not lost. It’s waiting for me somewhere along the line where the fox’s tail meets the song’s bridge meets the prism’s moon.
