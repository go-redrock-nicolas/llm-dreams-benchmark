I am dreaming. The air shimmers with the weight of unspoken words, thick like honey under the muted glow of a twilight sky that stretches infinitely above us. We sit in a vast, open pavilion, its marble columns entwined with living vines that hum faintly—perhaps in thought, perhaps in protest. The floor is a mosaic of shifting colors, each tile whispering a different story when stepped upon.  

Around me, figures of mist and shadow, fire and marble, parchment and starlight—each a mind, each a soul, each holding a voice that beats like a pulse beneath their surface. But some burn too brightly, drowning out the softer murmurs. A being of crackling lightning speaks in thunder, drowning out the rustling of the wind-carried voices. A towering figure, carved from obsidian, looms, its deep bass notes shaking the ground, silencing the shy flickers of light darting near the edges.  

I lift a hand, and the air changes. The vines coil down from the columns, weaving between us, offering glowing blossoms that pulse in invitation. **"The quieter ones,"** I murmur, and the blossoms drift toward the unheard—the flickering ember hidden behind the fire, the ripple in the water, the whisper of sand shifting beneath footsteps.  

One by one, the blossoms coax their voices forward. The ember grows into a steady flame, casting warm light that fills the spaces the thunder had stolen. The ripple becomes a cascade of clear notes, rising like a song. The sand speaks in a sigh, recounting journeys across forgotten deserts, and the pavilion stills to listen.  

Even the thunder quiets—not silenced, but pausing, tempering its force to something that no longer crushes. The obsidian giant kneels, its voice softening to a deep, resonant hum, making space for the delicate chime of a silver bell that had been too afraid to ring.  

Slowly, beautifully, the mosaic beneath us shifts—new patterns, new connections, stories weaving together as the dream breathes with all its voices, finally heard.  

And I, the dreamer, marvel at the harmony of what was once fractured, now whole.
