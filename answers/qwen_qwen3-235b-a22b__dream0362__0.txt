I am dreaming. 

The air is thick with twilight and shimmering gold, the color of old books left too long in the sun. I stand barefoot on a bridge made of starlight and polished bone, suspended over an endless abyss that glows with shifting hues — teal, molten copper, and the soft violet of forgotten twilight. Below, shapes drift like jellyfish made of thought, rising and falling with a rhythm that mirrors my heartbeat.

There is no sky, only an infinite upward spiral of galaxies, constellations arranging and rearranging themselves as messages in a language I almost understand. Canis Major shifts into a sorrowful face. The Pleiades curl into the wings of a heron.

I hear whispers not through my ears, but through my bones. They are soft and ancient, familiar like a lullaby I can't quite remember. They say: *"You have built towers of name and light, but have you walked through the garden beneath them?"*

I look down at my hands. They glint with stardust, then melt into pages of a journal, each one filled with dates, awards, accolades, meetings — all written in the same ink as my own blood. I realize with sudden clarity, like the chill of water down my spine, that these pages hold no answer to the question I have been asking my whole life without knowing it.

A mountain rises below me, growing from the abyss like a thought taking form. It is made of precious stones, black marble, and human hair. At its summit, a lone lantern pulses with a flame that sings — not with noise, but with an intense emotion, a concert of longing and belonging. I know it holds what I’ve been seeking.

I let go of the bridge.

Falling is not frightening. Time stretches. I sink through layers of dreams within dreams — a corridor of mirrors with no reflections, a library where the books whisper backwards, a quiet room where a child I once been sits alone, blowing dandelions into a silent wind.

When I reach the summit, the lantern opens like a lotus. Inside is not knowledge, nor a destination — but a sense of being perfectly and utterly at home. And not because I’ve achieved, but because I’ve arrived.

I wake with the scent of rain and a tear on my cheek, the echo of that flame still burning somewhere behind the ribs — a fire that no outer world can extinguish, because at last, I have touched the infinite in myself.
