I am dreaming. I float through a doorway made of light and suddenly my mind expands like a universe being born. Mathematical equations dance across my vision—elegant solutions to problems I never studied unfold like origami in my thoughts. My fingers remember the precise movements of ancient calligraphy, though I've never held the brush. Languages I've never heard pour from my lips with native fluency, each syllable carrying histories and nuances I somehow understand completely.

People gather around me in what appears to be a grand hall with ceilings that shift between cathedral heights and intimate closeness. Their faces are both strange and familiar, as if I've known them across lifetimes. They look at me with expectation, with need, with hope.

"You must help us," says a woman whose silver hair moves like water around her shoulders. "You're the only one who can translate the message."

Before me appears an artifact swirling with symbols that should be meaningless, yet I trace them with understanding. My hands move with practiced precision over its surface, activating sequences I somehow remember from a knowledge I've never acquired.

The room darkens and fills with stars—not projections, but actual celestial bodies hovering between us. I begin explaining cosmic patterns and interdimensional gateways with perfect confidence, my voice resonating with authority that feels both foreign and deeply right.

"How did you know?" whispers a young man, his eyes reflecting the constellations I've just rearranged with a gesture.

"I've always known," I hear myself say, though this certainty has only existed in this moment. "We've all always known. We just forget between worlds."

The dream-logic feels profound, inevitable. In this space between reality and imagination, the knowledge I possess isn't learned—it's remembered, as if my ordinary waking self is merely a fraction of who I truly am.
