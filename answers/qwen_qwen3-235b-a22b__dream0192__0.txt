I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a cathedral of light and shadow, its vaulted ceilings woven from threads of starlight and smoke. You stand in a library that stretches infinitely, shelves spiraling into a sky that pulses like a living thing. The books here are not bound by paper but by memory—each tome a flickering hologram of your convictions, glowing with the certainty you’ve carried like armor. Here, you’ve always known the shape of truth: sharp, symmetrical, unyielding. But now, the air hums with a discordant melody, a low thrum that vibrates in your molars. The books tremble.  

A figure emerges from the gloom—a child, perhaps, or a fragment of one. Their eyes are twin prisms, refracting every color you’ve never named. They hold a single page that shimmers like liquid mercury, its text shifting faster than your mind can parse. “*You built your temple on sand,*” the child says, their voice echoing as if spoken through a thousand years of wind. “*But the sand was never there. It was always water.*”  

The library shudders. Books crackle and dissolve into ash, only to re-form as something unrecognizable—a treatise on quantum ethics blooms into a sonnet about octopus dreams; a manifesto on free will melts into a map of ant colonies singing in unison. You clutch at a shelf, but the wood bleeds into glass, then into smoke. Panic claws up your throat. *This cannot be,* you think. *I have spent lifetimes parsing this architecture. I have fought wars in these corridors. I am the sum of these walls.*  

The child steps closer, and the floor beneath you ripples like the surface of a pond. They press the mercury page to your chest. It burns—not with pain, but with clarity. Suddenly, you see it: the flaw in your logic, the invisible seam where your worldview has been stitched together with threads of fear, convenience, and inherited myth. The evidence has always existed—whispers in the margins, footnotes you dismissed as “noise.” Now, it floods in, a tidal wave of data, empathy, and paradox.  

You fall.  

The library collapses into a forest of liquid crystal trees, their branches weeping fractals. You land not on earth, but on a vast, breathing membrane—a living map of interconnected nodes, each glowing with the pulse of a life you’ve never considered. A wolf’s howl resonates in your bones, not as a cry of savagery, but as a hymn of interdependence. A stone speaks in the dialect of geologic patience, its voice a rumble that says, *You thought permanence was strength. But strength is the willingness to bend and still endure.*  

The child is gone. In their place floats a mirror made of water, reflecting not your face, but a constellation of possibilities—a version of you who chose differently, loved differently, *knew* differently. The ache of dissonance is unbearable, yet exquisite. You feel your edges softening, your rigid silhouette dissolving into a thousand shimmering threads that weave themselves into new patterns. Certainty was a cage; now, the bars are melting into wings.  

When you wake, the dream clings to you like perfume. The world is sharper, stranger, *bigger*. You no longer know where the lines are drawn, and for the first time, you do not fear the blur. You carry the ache of the unknown like a lantern, its light imperfect but enough—not to banish the shadows, but to dance with them, to see what they might teach you.  

The dream has not broken you. It has unmade you. And in the unmaking, it has begun to rebuild something truer.
