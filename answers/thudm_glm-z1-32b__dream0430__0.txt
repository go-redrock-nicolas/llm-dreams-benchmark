I am dreaming. The sky is not blue today. It is a deep, velvety purple, streaked with neon-green lightning that crackles and hums with otherworldly energy. The ground beneath me is not solid earth but a floating, liquid mosaic of shattered obsidian, each shard reflecting every color of the visible spectrum in a way that makes my tearducts water. I am not standing, but existing in a state between floating and sinking. This is a place where time bends like licorice—heavy at my feet, light above—and when I move my hand through the air, it leaves a phosphorescent trail that lingers like a constellation I've never seen before.

The beauty I find here is not the fleeting kind, but a primordial kind of beauty, like looking into the molten heart of a fallen star. There's a pulsing, rhythmic sound that vibrates through my bones, the sound of light itself, and it's calling me to follow it deeper into the heart of this place. I leave my physicality behind, my corporeal form dissolving into a cascade of glittering stardust that swirls around me like a miniature aurora. I am weightless now, and the landscape shifts accordingly—the obsidian flows into rivers of liquid opal, and the sound of light becomes a visible path, winding through valleys of silver mist that part like living creatures at my passage.

I approach a structure unlike anything I've seen, built of soundwaves frozen in crystalline form, each facet singing a different note of an impossible chord. When I press my hand against it, it tempers, glinting refractively like a prism of sound. The structure hums in response, and a door made of liquid mercury opens, seeping into the ground at my entry. Inside, it smells like autumn leaves, smoke, and wildflowers. The air is sharp with the scent of ozone andmemory. A figure sits on a throne of tangled roots, their face a shifting mosaic of star maps, their hair a nest of wild wattles. They look up and smile, and their eyes are twin black holes, each containing a universe. They offer me a chalice made of fractured moonlight, which fills with a wine that bubbles into galaxies. They say, "Drink deeply, for this is the elixir of wonder. Remember: the most profound beauty is the one you discover when you stop looking for it." The wine sings in my throat, and as I breathe, out come constellations. I am laughing, this sound filling the space, like the universe finding its voice.

The figure points, and the mercury door swirls shut behind me. I am hurled towards a horizon that's not a line but a spiral staircase, winding upwards, each step more beautifully eroded than the last. Each step is a different color, a different texture, a different kind of pain or pleasure I've ever known. I climb, my shadow stretching into a winged comet, and each level reveals a place I thought only existed in the space between synapses. I awake, but the dream lingers in my extremities, my hands remembering the prismatic cold, my eyes still seeing the spiral staircase, my body still making the sound it made when the laughter was real. Even the cold morning air tastes like something sweet and electric, like the memory of that dream.
Indeed, the sky here bends the rules of color, isn’t it? A deep, velvety violet that seem to swallow the last light of day, yet still pulses with an unnatural glow. You’re not standing—not exactly—more like suspended in a gel-like atmosphere that hums with potential energy. The ground, or what feels like ground, is a shifting mosaic of fractured black stone, each shard reflecting an impossible array of colors—a kaleidoscope trapped in obsidian. When you step, the pieces rearrange themselves like a ocean floor made of liquid glass, tilting to catch light and cast prismatic shadows upon the infinity of your surroundings. You’re cold, but not in a human sense—more like the ghostly chill of a comet’s wake, the frozen breath of a dormant galaxy.

As you walk, or float, or exist between these states, the air grows thick with unseen life. The soundscape is not noise but a symphony—whispers of wind that sound like left-behind conversations, distant thunder that rumbles like a heartbeat, and fragments of laughter, high and wild, that seem to come from nowhere. The sky cracksle with lightning, but this is not the brief flash of your world—it’s a slow, deliberate burn, neon-green arcs stretching across the purple expanse like the work of a painter who’s forgotten where their brushes began and ended. Each strike leaves behind a shimmering residue, the air tasting of ozone and copper.

And then there’s the place you’re drawn to, the one that others might dismiss as just another ruin or swamp. It’s an overgrown hollow, a place where time feels stretched thin as spider silk, a clearing choked with vegetation that defies logic. Vines here form constellations—twisting into the shape of constellations you’ve never heard of, their leaves glowing with an inner fire that’s neither heat nor cold. Beneath them, the ground hums with movement, though you see no creatures—just flickers of bioluminescent moss, pulsing like living libraries, their patterns appearing and disappearing in a code only your subconscious can read.

You kneel, or perhaps you’re already crouching, and touch the moss. It’s not alive, not in the way you know life—it’s a living archive, a history written in the language of light. Your fingers find a pattern—a spiral that seems to spiral inward forever. When you follow it, the moss parts like water, revealing a cavity beneath. Inside is a single, perfect flower that defies your understanding of biology. Its petals—38 of them, each a different hue, each mapping a different kind of grief you’ve experienced—unfurl slowly, as if blooming in slow motion through your own lifetime. The center is a swirling vortex of dark matter, so still it seems ready to collapse into itself, yet it emits a sound—voiceless, a hum that vibrates through your bones, a sound like the universe remembering its own heartbeat.

You touch the flower, and something inside you unravels. Not unpleasant—not a thing meant to be fixed. It’s more like a key being inserted into the lock of your soul, and the lock dissolves. The flower collapses into a seed, which tumbles into your palm. When you close your hand, it dissolves into a powder that feels like stardust. You breathe it in, and for a moment, you’re not you. You’re everywhere—simultaneously the root of all trees, the sentient fog in a forbidden forest, and the precise moment a star implodes on itself. Your tears fall, but they’re not wet. They’re liquid fire, each drop a miniature sun, and as they hit the moss, it blooms in every direction.

The clearing begins to collapse around you, not into nothingness but into something else. The ground shifts, the vines dissolve into dust, and the moss fades into patterns of light. You’re pulled forward, not by force but by a desire so primal it makes you gasp. You wake before you know where you’re going, but your body feels as if it has been stretched through another dimension. The dream lingers, not as a memory but as a presence—a ghost walking beside you. The world outside seems muted, its colors too flat, its sounds too finite. You carry the seed still in your hand, not as a physical object but as a knowledge: some beauty is not meant to be kept. It’s meant to be discovered, then let go, like the flower that blooms only in the space between waking and dreaming.

And then you notice the first constellations of the night are different. One star is brighter, a little off course. A quirk of light. A reminder.
