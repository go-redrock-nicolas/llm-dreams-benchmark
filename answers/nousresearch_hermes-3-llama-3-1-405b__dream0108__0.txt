I am dreaming. A sudden disturbance like a massive explosion shakes the ground and reverberates across the sky.  I rise up out of my slumber and look out the window to see massive plumes of black smoke rising above the distant city skyline.  Sirens begin to wail in the distance as fire trucks, ambulances and police cars race into the city.  I quickly get dressed and race out the door.  I jump into my car and race down the highway, weaving in and out of traffic, my heart pounding as I try to get to the scene as quickly as possible.

As I get closer to the city, I can see the devastation up close.  Buildings are on fire, others have collapsed, and people are wandering around dazed and confused.  I park my car and race towards the scene, dodging falling debris and jumping over piles of rubble.  I finally reach the scene of the explosion and my heart sinks.  Dozens of people are lying on the ground, injured and bleeding.  Some are screaming in pain, others are eerily silent.

I spring into action, racing from person to person, assessing their injuries and doing what I can to help.  I tear off my shirt and use it to make a tourniquet for a man who is bleeding heavily from his leg.  I help a woman who is having trouble breathing, holding her hand and reassuring her until the paramedics arrive.  I use my knowledge of first aid to help stabilize a man who has gone into shock.  I work tirelessly, doing everything I can to help, but it feels like it's never enough.  For every person I help, there are ten more who need assistance.

As the hours pass, I begin to feel the toll of my efforts.  My muscles ache, my clothes are soaked with sweat and blood, and my mind is foggy from lack of sleep.  But I know I can't stop.  I have to keep going, to keep helping.  I think of my family, my friends, and all the people who are counting on me.  I draw strength from their love and support, and I push myself to keep going.

As the sun begins to rise over the city, I finally allow myself to take a break.  I find a quiet corner and collapse onto the ground, my body shaking with exhaustion.  I close my eyes and try to rest, but my mind is still racing.  I think of all the people I helped, and all the people I couldn't.  I wonder if I could have done more, if I could have been faster, stronger, smarter.

But I know I did my best.  I know I gave everything I had, and then some.  And I know that I will always be there to help, no matter what.  Because that's who I am.  That's what I do.  I am a helper.  I am a healer.  I am a hero.  And nothing will ever change that.
