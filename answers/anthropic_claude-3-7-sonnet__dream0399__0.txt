I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the threshold between two worlds. Behind me lies a bustling city of sharp angles and defined boundaries—buildings of glass and steel rising like geometric certainties against a cloudless sky. But before me stretches something else entirely: a landscape that pulses and breathes, where the horizon seems to inhale and exhale with gentle undulation.

As I step forward, I realize my body has become semi-translucent. Through my skin, I can see tiny motes of light flowing like luminous blood cells—each one containing a memory, an emotion, a fragment of someone else's experience. 

A woman passes by, her face stern, shoulders hunched beneath invisible weight. Normally, I might label her "unfriendly" or "cold," but now I can see the constellation of lights within her—blue pinpricks of recent grief, the amber glow of childhood wounds still unhealed, the green sparkle of hope she nurtures despite everything. I understand her completely without a word exchanged.

The landscape shifts. I'm walking through what appears to be a vast library, except the books are people—some open, some closed, some with torn pages carefully mended. A man I once despised for his arrogance stands before me, but his book is open now. I see chapters of rejection, desperate attempts to prove worth, armor built layer by painful layer.

"I see you," I whisper, and the words have physical form—gold threads that weave between us, connecting rather than separating.

The library dissolves into an ocean where I swim effortlessly. Each person I've ever judged floats nearby, their inner worlds visible as intricate coral reefs of experience. I reach out, touching these reefs without fear, understanding finally that complexity isn't something to simplify or dismiss.

Overhead, the sky rains tiny silver keys. I catch one and somehow know—each key opens a door to compassion previously locked within me.

I wake with tears on my face, the boundary between myself and others forever thinned.
