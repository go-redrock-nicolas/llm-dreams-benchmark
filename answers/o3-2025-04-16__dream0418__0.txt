I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

You step onto a vast ballroom floor varnished to an impossible, liquid sheen. Above, chandeliers float rather than hang, their crystals gently revolving like galaxies caught in slow motion. Music drifts everywhere and nowhere—an orchestral murmur that promises company, laughter, shared stories—yet the hall is empty except for you.

You feel the ache of absence in the pit of your stomach. You long to whirl with the unseen guests, but instead you drift to the margin of the room, tracing the curving wall with hesitant fingertips. Each time you muster the courage to step toward the center, the music’s volume swells, crowding your ears until you retreat again. The halls of your mind seem to echo with two voices at once: one pleading for companionship, the other issuing quiet orders to keep your distance.

A set of double doors appears where the wall should be. They stand half-ajar, exhaling cold midnight air. You slip through them and find yourself on a twilight shoreline. The sand is lavender, the sea a deep indigo, and the moon—enormous, low, pulsing with pearly light—hovers just above the horizon. Thousands of footprints dot the beach, evidence of a recent gathering, yet no one lingers now. You trail after the prints, feeling simultaneously hopeful and heavy.

Half buried in sand waits a peculiar mirror, rimmed in weathered brass. Instead of reflecting your body, it shows a crowd of versions of you—some smiling, some anxious, some gazing shyly at the ground. They chatter in a hush too soft to decipher. When you extend a trembling hand toward the glass, several of your reflections shy away while one steps forward, earnest, open-armed. That forward-stepping self says without sound: “Come as you are, not as you fear you’ll be.”

The mirror dissolves into mist before you can reply, and the ocean withdraws far beyond the normal tide line, exposing a long corridor of wet sand. In the distance stands a lighthouse carved from translucent quartz, lit from within by a honey-colored glow. Instinct tells you others are gathered there, warming themselves by its beacon, sharing stories you yearn to hear. Yet every time you attempt to walk toward it, the sand beneath your feet hardens into glass, showing a polished reflection of your solitary figure. The shine is beautiful, but it feels brittle, fragile, ready to crack at the faintest misstep.

You inhale, and the night breeze carries the faintest aroma of spiced cocoa, the unmistakable scent of welcome. You remember the mirror’s message. You decide to test the glass, not with extravagant leaps toward the distant lighthouse, but with small, deliberate steps. The surface quivers, but it holds. One step. Two. Three. In your chest, the usual surge of panic flares, but you breathe through it, letting the ocean’s hush fill your lungs. Somewhere behind you, the ballroom music returns, softer now, less demanding, almost encouraging.

A lone figure materializes ahead—a woman woven of starlight and shadow. She holds a lantern shaped like a water droplet. Within it flickers a single flame the color of sunrise.

“Why do you walk alone?” she asks, voice like the rustle of silk curtains.

You answer with the honesty dreams allow: “Because it feels safer to ache alone than risk aching in front of others.”

She nods, sliding open a window in the lantern. The flame leaps out, turning into a tiny phoenix that circles your head before settling inside your chest. Warmth spreads through you, surprising and gentle. The glass path beneath your feet grows cloudy, then soft, transforming into fine, velvety sand.

“You can’t snuff out loneliness by shrinking,” she whispers. “Shrink, and loneliness only grows to fill the new space. Expand, and there’s room for something else.”

You look behind you. The ballroom doors glimmer at the shoreline’s edge. A handful of distant silhouettes now glide across that mirrored floor—the promise of a gathering beginning anew. Ahead, the lighthouse seems closer, its golden light thumping like a heartbeat in the dark.

You realize you don’t need to choose between shore and hall, company or solitude. You simply have to keep walking, heart alight, honest about your longing, patient with your fear. With each step, more figures bloom out of the dusk—friends not yet met, companions who carry lanterns of their own.

You raise a hand in greeting. One by one, they wave back.

The dream dims like a candle at dawn, but the warmth inside your ribs lingers, and the music follows you into waking, soft yet insistent—an invitation to step back into life’s ballroom, this time ready to dance.
