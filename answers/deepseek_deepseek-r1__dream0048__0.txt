I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**

The air tastes of rust and ozone, thick with the hum of dormant power. You stand in a cavernous chamber, walls etched with glyphs that pulse faintly cyan, as if breathing in time with your heartbeat. Before you looms the machine—a cathedral of brass and obsidian, studded with gears the size of wagon wheels, their teeth interlocking like the jaws of ancient beasts. Crystalline pipes coil around its core, throbbing with a liquid light that seems *alive*, resentful of its stillness. Above, the ceiling groans, raining dust; something primal and hungry claws at the distant edges of your awareness. Time is collapsing.  

Your hands move without permission, drawn to a panel etched with spiraling constellations. The metal is warm, almost *pliant*, molding to your fingertips. A gear shudders, then spins—counterclockwise, defying logic—and a lens snaps open, projecting a hologram of a dying star. Symbols flare: a serpent swallowing its tail, a seven-petaled flower dripping mercury. You realize the machine isn’t merely mechanical. It’s **alphabetized agony**, a language of desperation carved by beings who feared oblivion.  

A lever crackles with static. You pull it.  

The chamber convulses. Gears invert, grinding into reverse, and the pipes flood with crimson fluid. A lens focuses on your chest, and suddenly you *feel* it—the machine reading your synapses, your memories of flight, of fire, of your mother’s voice. It demands a sacrifice. A prismatic keyhole materializes, shaped like your own iris. You press your face to it.  

The machine wails.  

A gear slices your palm, blood sizzling into the mechanism. The glyphs blaze gold, and the hologram shifts: now a labyrinth, now a nursery rhyme, now a screaming face that might be your own. Behind you, the walls splinter. Jagged cracks vein the floor, revealing abyssal depths where half-formed shadows writhe. The machine’s heart—a pulsing black orb—screams in a frequency that cracks your molars. You slam your fist into it.  

**Silence.**  

Then—lightning. The chamber liquefies, walls melting into a cyclone of stardust. The machine unfolds, becoming a bridge of throbbing light, arcing toward a door in the sky. You run, your shadow fracturing into a thousand shards that whisper secrets in dead tongues. The door opens. Beyond it: a garden of frozen flames, a piano playing itself in reverse, a shore where the waves crawl backward into the horizon.  

You wake.  

Your pillow is damp. Your palms still smell of blood and lightning.
