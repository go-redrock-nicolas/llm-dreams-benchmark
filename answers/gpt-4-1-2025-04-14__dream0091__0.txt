I am dreaming. …step into a vast, echoing chamber, its high vaulted ceilings dissolving into a misty infinity above. Moonlight cascades in long cool ribbons through impossible stained-glass windows, painting the stone floor with whirling colors that ripple with my every footstep. The air hums—not with music, exactly, but with the thrumming expectancy of a thousand held breaths.

Before me stands a grand, ancient table carved from charcoal-black wood, twisted and gnarled as if plucked from the nightmares of a sleeping forest. Around it sit the critics—shadows cloaked in robes of midnight, their eyes glowing silver beneath peaked hoods. Their presence chills the air, a cold current that prickles my skin and stirs the fragile heart of my creation clutched in my hands.

I glance down. My work is a curious artifact—not quite a book, nor a painting, but a living thing: a delicate orb of shifting light, pulsing softly with all the hope, fear, doubt, and love I’ve poured into it. Wisps of memory and emotion spiral lazily around it like tiny galaxies. The closer the critics lean, the brighter and more feverishly it glows, as if drawing strength from my trembling anticipation.

My mouth goes dry as I set the orb upon the table. Instantly, the shadows lean forward, their eyes narrowing. Words hang heavy on my tongue, the introduction I’d practiced a million times dissolving into mist. In the hush, I feel their scrutiny like cold water, trickling through the seams in my confidence.

Yet, as their spectral fingers probe the shivering orb, something remarkable happens. It responds—flaring in color and song, morphing into shapes and echoes of my deepest dreams, painting the walls with strange, beautiful vistas: a field of blue sunflowers beneath lavender skies, cities built from books and laughter, rivers made of moonbeams and childhood memories.

The critics begin to murmur, their severe expressions softening. For a moment, a flicker of my own vulnerability dazzles within their silvery eyes. My creation, laid bare and trembling, takes on a life beyond judgment, bridging the chasm between artist and critic, dreamer and doubter. In this surreal cathedral of reflection, I realize the critics are reflections of myself—harsh, but capable of awe.

As the orb buoys upward, spinning golden filaments into the ether, I feel the weight lift from my chest, and relief blooms wild in the deepest parts of my dreaming heart.
