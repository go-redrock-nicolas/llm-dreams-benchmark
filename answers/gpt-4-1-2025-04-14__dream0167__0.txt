I am dreaming. …do not retreat, nor do I allow the bitter tension to corrode my resolve. Instead, I call for the negotiations to adjourn as dawn stains the starlit tapestry outside the great stone hall. With the first rays sliding across the battered banners and shattered emblems that hang overhead, I steal quietly from my chambers and descend into the heart of the ancient woodlands that breathe on the border between the two realms.

Mist curls around my ankles as I walk, listening to the stories whispered by the roots and leaves—the primordial memory of the land itself, which bore witness to both kindness and cruelty long before the words "enemy" or "ally" ever passed mortal lips. I gather ochre earth and a few still-glowing embers from an old, abandoned fire pit: relics taken from the forgotten times when both factions feasted beneath the boughs together.

With these in hand, I return before both leaders, who sit stone-faced and shadowed by the heavy history between them. Wordlessly, I craft a small, flickering fire in the center of the negotiation circle, letting it cast dancing gold and crimson across their faces. I scatter the ochre earth into the flames, and the fire shimmers, releasing a memory-laden fragrance that fills the air—a scent both delegations recall from lullabies and blessings passed down through generations.

I speak not of treaties or borders, but of memory and human sorrow: of shared ancestors who sang together, whose joys and griefs once intermingled. I recount the oldest legends, ones half-remembered even in their deepest mourning, of the twin rivers that run parallel for miles before joining at sunrise.

The silence is heavy, but its weight is different—a silence crackling with old hope and fragile understanding. The uncompromising lines etched in centuries of bloodshed begin, almost imperceptibly, to blur. The leaders’ eyes, hard as granite before, gloss with the shimmer of distant yearning.

And I know, as the dawn fully claims the sky, that something essential and unseen has shifted. The true negotiation, it turns out, happens not in the exchange of demands and concessions, but in the reclaiming of memory—the deepest place where peace can be imagined into being.
