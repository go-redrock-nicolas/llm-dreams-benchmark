I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a familiar yet strangely altered city. The buildings stretch impossibly tall, their windows reflecting not the sky but deep oceanic scenes. My footsteps echo differently here—each one producing ripples of color that spread across the cobblestone streets.

My friend Maya stands at a street corner, but something about her is dramatically changed. Her movements are mechanical and precise, her once warm smile now calculated. More jarring still, tiny constellations seem to float just beneath her skin, shifting with each gesture she makes. She's arranging peculiar objects on a floating table—ordinary items like teacups and paperclips, but she handles them with the reverence of sacred artifacts.

"I've discovered the pattern," she tells me without looking up, her voice overlapping with itself in echoes. "Everything connects if you follow the invisible threads." She takes a teacup and balances it impossibly on its handle, defying gravity.

The sky above darkens to a rich purple, and I feel a decision weighing on me. People passing by seem untroubled by Maya's transformation, but I alone can see the constellation-light escaping from her fingertips, rewriting the air around her.

Do I join her in this strange ritual, risking being pulled into whatever has changed her? Or do I try to pull her away, back toward what I remember as reality? The buildings around us begin to hum a low, resonant tone as I consider what to do next...
