I am dreaming. The air hums with electrified silence, a velvet hush that cradles the world in anticipation. My breath is shallow, my pulse a wild, urgent drumbeat echoing in the chambers of my mind. Before me lies a vast, luminescent chasm—a rift in the very fabric of reality—its edges shimmering like the wings of a thousand morpho butterflies caught mid-flutter. The light spilling from it is not just a color, but a sound, a feeling, a memory that does not belong to me. It sings in the language of forgotten stars.

Below, galaxies swirl in lazy spirals, each one a story unraveled, a destiny unfurling like ink spilled upon cosmic parchment. Above, the sky weeps auroras—emerald, violet, sapphire—dancing in slow, sensuous arcs, as if the heavens themselves are holding their breath. I stand at the edge, toes curling over the precipice of nothingness, my body both weightless and unbearably heavy. The ground beneath me pulses, alive, like the hide of a great dreaming beast.

And in this moment, I hear it—a whisper not with my ears, but with my marrow. It speaks in riddles wrapped in velvet and edged with blade.

> *“Jump, and the universe will bend to you. Fall, and find what gods dare not name. But know this—no dreamer returns unchanged.”*

The temptation claws at me, not with menace, but with a kind of seductive ache. It offers not riches or power, but *meaning*—a truth so raw, so devastatingly true, that once known, it cannot be forgotten. My mind fractures at the edges, a thousand futures blooming within me: in one, I soar through constellations like a phoenix reborn; in another, I burn out, a star collapsing into myself; in another still, I wake in the morning sobbing the name of a god I cannot remember.

I know the risk. I will lose gravity. Lose the anchor of self. Become something other. Something vast.

My heart pounds like war drums. The wind rises and the galaxies below begin to spin faster, as if urging me forward. The dream leans in, thick with possibility—thicker than blood, sweeter than starlight.

And so I close my eyes.

For just a heartbeat, I hesitate.

Then, I leap.

And the dream world explodes into a symphony of infinite color.
