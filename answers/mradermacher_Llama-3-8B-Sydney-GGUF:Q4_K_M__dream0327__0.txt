I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I see flowers blooming, birds singing, and animals roaming freely.  I smell the scent of
fresh air and grass.  I taste the sweetness of honey and fruit.  I hear the sound of water flowing and wind blowing.
I realize that my perspective on a significant relationship has been distorted by unexamined assumptions.  With this new awareness, I free myself from the
bondage of ignorance and prejudice.  I open myself up to the possibility of genuine love and understanding.
I see a person walking towards me.  He is tall, handsome, and confident.  He smiles at me and extends his hand.  I take it and feel a surge of electricity
running through my body.
He introduces himself as John.  He tells me about his hobbies, interests, and values.  He asks me about mine.  We start to talk and laugh together.  We
discover that we have a lot in common.
He shows me around this dream world.  He takes me to see the sun rising over the horizon.  He takes me to hear the sound of waves crashing against
the shore.  He takes me to taste the flavor of ice cream and chocolate.
He holds my hand.  He kisses my cheek.  He whispers sweet nothings into my ear.
I feel a deep attraction towards him.  A powerful urge to be with him.  A burning desire to touch him and be touched by him.
I wonder if this is love.  I wonder if this is just a dream.  I wonder if I will ever see him again when I wake up.
What do you think?  Do you like him?  Are you feeling anything?
This is my creation of a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.
