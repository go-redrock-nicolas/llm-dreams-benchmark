I am dreaming. —I find myself standing alone at the mouth of a stadium that could never exist outside of sleep. Its colossal archways lean at impossible angles, ribbed with glimmering constellations instead of steel, as though the night sky has been melted down and poured into architecture. A hush rolls through the dream-coliseum—part inhale, part tidal whisper—while a billion fireflies drift overhead, their lights pulsing in perfect unison like a great, slow heartbeat.

I look down. The ground beneath my boots is a living mosaic: tessellations of polished obsidian, each tile reflecting a different scene from my past. Childhood victories flicker beside devastating losses. For a moment I freeze, mesmerized, until every shard brightens at once—an unspoken cue. The floor tilts forward, ushering me toward the arena.

My hands tighten around the championship gear slung across my shoulders—half-specter, half-equipment. In waking life it would be a racket, a glove, a sword, a paintbrush—here it is all of them, flickering like a rapidly shuffled deck of cards. Its shifting shape reminds me that this match is not bound to any single sport or art; it will test every ounce of my will.

I step onto the main stage, and the stadium erupts in a chorus of thunderclaps—no crowds are visible, yet their presence is undeniable, felt in the electric pressure of anticipation. The sky overhead tears open into curtains of aurora that drip shimmering colors onto the field, staining the turf with rivers of emerald and ultraviolet. Each droplet blossoms into crystalline flowers that hum with a frequency just above hearing, like the distant engine of the universe.

Across from me, my opponent emerges. At first nothing but silhouette, then a mirror. It is me—older, younger, stronger, frailer—every version of myself braided into one figure. Eyes like molten gold regard me with equal parts pride and challenge. When this Doppel-Champion lifts a hand, the air ripples outward, revealing a floating scorecard: not numbers, but memories yet unwritten. My task is clear—out-perform the potential of every path I might have taken.

The referee descends—a giant hourglass with wings, sand swirling upward against gravity. Its inverted fall counts down the time allotted for this singular contest. Suddenly the field rearranges itself: lines of chalk become canyon walls, goalposts become lighthouse beams, the center circle becomes a whirlpool of stardust. Somewhere, a gong strikes, low and deep, and the match begins.

We dash forward simultaneously. My gear locks into the shape of a blazing quill; my mirrored rival brandishes a shard of moonlight shaped like a blade. We clash in a ballet of mixed rituals—serve and volley on an invisible net strung between thunderheads, fencing footwork across lily-pad stepping stones, brushstrokes that paint real terrain onto blank air. Each exchange births new landscapes: with a single parry I carve a staircase of clouds; with a counter-stroke they raise a forest of crystal pines that chime in the wind.

I feel the beat of my heart syncing with the stadium’s silent spectators, forcing me past exhaustion into that impossible territory where effort becomes instinct. Sweat beads and bursts into miniature comets that arc away and dissolve into constellations. My rival and I trade point after point—moments of triumph swirl, then slip away like sand in the referee’s glass.

At match point, I sense the dream’s horizon bending around us—time is nearly gone. The arena has dwindled to a single floating platform over an abyss lined with the echoes of unchosen futures. We lock eyes; a wordless pact passes between us: this last rally will decide not merely victory, but the narrative of who I become when I wake.

I inhale all the luminous air left in the dream and leap. My quill ignites with violet flame; their moon-blade fractures into a thousand shards that orbit like planets. Our weapons meet in a cross of light so bright it blanks out color. For a suspended heartbeat everything freezes—the sand in the referee’s hourglass hangs mid-fall, every firefly flickers off—and then the brilliance implodes inward, into my chest.

Silence. Darkness. I’m floating, weightless, holding nothing but the ember of that final collision. The stadium is gone, my rival dispersed into stardust that returns to me like swallows finding home. Slowly, the ember cools to a warm glow in my palm, revealing itself as a single seed.

The hourglass flutters above, its wings folding delicately. The last grain of upward-falling sand reaches the top bulb and settles. A staircase of moonlight unfurls before me, leading to a door carved into the darkness. As I climb, the seed pulses, and I know: the dream has not crowned a champion in trophies or applause—it has distilled every trial, every risk, every version of myself into this single, living possibility.

At the door I pause. Breath held. I tuck the seed into my chest, feel it take root, and turn the handle.

Awake—morning light spills across my room, ordinary and miraculous. My hand rests over my heart, where something tiny and incandescent beats along with me, an echo of the dream’s unfathomable stadium. I rise, knowing the championship never truly ends—it germinates in daylight, waiting for the next impossible match I dare to enter.
