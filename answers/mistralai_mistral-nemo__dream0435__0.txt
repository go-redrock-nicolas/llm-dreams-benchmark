I am dreaming. I'm floating in a grand, opulent ballroom from a bygone era, the kind where the chandeliers are works of art and the mirrors stretch from floor to ceiling, reflecting the crowd until it seems like an infinite sea of people. The air is filled with the enchanting melody of a string quartet, their music weaving through the conversation, laughter, and clinking glasses like a ribbon of sound.

I'm not just floating, though; I'm floating *as* a part of the crowd. I'm every person here, all at once. I can feel the soft silk of countless ball gowns, the warmth of tailored suits, the coolissimo of satin gloves. I've got a dozen pairs of eyes, all seeing the world from slightly different angles, and I feel a strange,split-second lag as my brain attempts to process the jumble of visual information.

The most astonishing part? I'm not just passengers in these bodies. I'm in control. I can feel the slightest tension in a muscle, the brush of fabric against skin, the tiniest shift in balance. I can manipulate these bodies as effortlessly as I would my own, yet each one feels distinct. There's the broad-shouldered man who stands like a soldier, the woman with the slight hunch who's always trying to seem smaller, the girl who can't stand still and shifts her weight from foot to foot.

Suddenly, I'm in the girl's body. She's dancing, or at least, she's trying to. She's young, her limbs coltish and uncoordinated, and she's trying too hard to adapt to the rhythm of the waltz. She's self-conscious, nervous, her movements stiff. But I'm inside her, and I can feel that tension, that discomfort. Empathy flows through me like a wave.

I reach out with her left hand, grabbing a nearby man's - the broad-shouldered one, I realize, even as I feel his surprise at her impulsive action. Without thinking, I guide her, or rather, I guide him. He's taller, stronger, and he takes the lead effortlessly. My hand is on his shoulder, my other hand in his, and I'm not trying to dance, I'm simply *feeling*. I feel his muscular shoulder blade, the line of his arm, the pressure of his hand on mine. And he feels it too, the change in her, the sudden confidence. He looks down at her, his eyes meeting mine, and he smiles.

In that moment, I'm not just her, I'm him too. I can feel his admiration, his approval. And I can feel her, the girl, blossoming under his gaze. Her steps become surer, her smile wider. And I, the dreamer, the observer, the puppeteer, feel a swell of pride, of joy, not for myself, but for them. For both of them.

The music swells, the dance continues, and I drift onwards, a ghost in the machine, feeling, learning, understanding. This is more than a dream; it's a symphony of senses, a ballet of empathy. It's uncomfortable at times, enlightening at others, but always, always fascinating. I am the wind that rustles the leaves, the rain that soaks the earth, the sun that warms the faces. I am everyone and no one, and in this dance, this waltz of humanity, I am everything.
