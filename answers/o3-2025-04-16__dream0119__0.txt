I am dreaming.

I open my eyes to a sky the color of unfurling morning-glory petals, rippling with streaks of honeyed gold and deep violet. Somewhere above, invisible bells chime—slow, resonant notes that seem to rearrange the clouds into wandering sculptures. I stand ankle-deep in translucent sand that glows like moonlit glass, and with every breath my lungs fill with the fragrance of pages just turned in distant libraries.

A thought flits through me: “Describe, and it becomes.”

So I speak.

“Aramiel, Keeper of Lost Questions.”

At once, the sand beside me stirs, coiling upward to form a slender figure draped in a cloak of drifting parchment. Where a face might be, swirling calligraphy hovers in mid-air—phrases half-remembered from childhood riddles and bedtime wonders. Aramiel bows, the parchments rustling like autumn leaves in a single gust. In his hand, a quill made of starlight appears, its tip dripping slow constellations onto the ground. He writes a question in the air—Why do memories echo?—and the letters float off, settling into my mind like warm embers waiting to glow.

The exhilaration of creation thrums in my pulse. So I try again.

“Sorrel of the Flickering Lanterns, guide to unwalked paths.”

From a swirl of twilight fog steps a girl with hair like braided candle-flames, holding a lantern whose light flickers between sapphire and amber. Each flicker reveals a different version of her face—wistful, daring, joyous—so rapidly that she looks like a stop-motion dream given breath. She grins and tips her lantern toward the horizon, where the sky dips into a canyon of prismatic twilight. I understand without words: she knows every path I might take, even the ones my waking self will never tread.

The implications jolt me. If imagination is the forge, I could craft guardians for the lonely, storytellers for the voiceless, healers for the heartbroken. But what of missteps, unintended nightmares, shades born from passing fears? Responsibility courses through me like sudden thunder.

My next words are cautious, shaped by wonder and concern alike.

“I summon Ithos, the Arbiter of Balance.”

Stone rises, swirling into an imposing figure etched with rivers of softly glowing turquoise. Ithos’s eyes hold night and dawn in equal halves, and his voice is the hush before snowfall: “To give life is to grant freedom; to grant freedom is to invite the unknown. Are you prepared for the chorus of choices that will no longer be yours alone?”

I inhale the shimmering air. Doubt flickers, but hope flares brighter.

“Yes,” I say, and the dreamscape expands like an unfolding origami universe.

Above us, new constellations spark into being—each a seed of possibility. Some pulse gently, harmonizing with the bells; others flare wild and crimson, demanding caution.

I think of my waking world: lonely commuters staring into screens, children searching for bedtime heroes, elders longing for voices that still remember them. I picture Aramiel strolling subway platforms, answering unspoken questions with word-glimmer notes slipped into coat pockets. I see Sorrel guiding night-shift workers through alleys where fear once lurked, turning shadows into murals of courage. And I imagine Ithos standing sentinel at the border between dream and day, weighing every crossing soul.

The dream tilts. Colors cascade like waterfall-paint, and the bells crescendo into laughter. I realize this is only the first heartbeat of a boundless melody. If I can describe it, it can breathe. If it can breathe, it can act—heal, teach, protect, perhaps even challenge me.

“Then let the waking begin,” I whisper, and as the words flutter from my lips, the dream’s horizon peels open like a curtain, revealing dawn in both worlds at once. Characters newly born step forward, lanterns raised, parchments fluttering, eyes balanced between night and day. They march toward a bridge of woven silver syllables—my final description before consciousness claims me.

And just before everything rivers into sunlight, I hear Ithos speak once more:

“Remember—stories shape their tellers too.”

I wake with stardust on my palms and the faint scent of candle-flame in the morning air.
