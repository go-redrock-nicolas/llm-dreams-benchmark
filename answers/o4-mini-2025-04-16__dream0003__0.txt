I am dreaming. You close your eyes and suddenly find yourself standing on the smooth, obsidian floor of an endless hall. The air shimmers with a faint, lavender glow. In the center of the hall rests a small, square box—black as starless night, yet alive with motion. Up close, its surface is a maze of twisting filigree: silver vines that coil and uncoil like living serpents, tiny emerald orbs that pulse with a slow heartbeat, and minute, looping runes that seem to crawl from one pattern to the next.

As you reach out, your fingertips graze the cool metal. At once, the runes flicker to life, bathing your hand in soft emerald light. The vines stretch and retract as though testing your touch, and the orbs thrum in syncopated rhythm, echoing a silent song you feel rather than hear. A faint hum pulses from within the box, vibrating through your bones. You realize: this object responds to wonder, not force.

Behind you, the walls dissolve, revealing a vast sky of swirling amethyst and jade clouds. Strange birds—wings like stained glass—drift by in slow motion, their calls weaving through the hall like wind chimes. The floor beneath you ripples, and the box lifts gently into the air. It hovers at chest height, as though inviting you to peer inside.

You lean in. No lid opens. Instead, the filigree rearranges itself into an eye, iris swirling with galaxies. Within that cosmic pupil, you glimpse fragments of distant worlds: a desert of violet sands under two moons; a city of floating spires entwined with golden vines; an ocean of liquid starlight where creatures of living crystal glide beneath the surface.

A soft voice—neither male nor female, older than time itself—whispers, “What do you seek?” The words vibrate through the air, and you realize the box speaks to your deepest desire. You feel the urge to ask: What lessons lie hidden? What truths do I hold within?

Your heart pounds. You focus, letting curiosity bloom, and the box responds. The silver vines retract like opening petals, the emerald orbs brighten, and the entire top panel slides aside—silently, impossibly—revealing a void of pure luminescence. You see yourself standing on a high cliff, gazing out into infinity. You see your own face, calm and knowing, smiling back through the light.

In that instant, the box is gone. You stand alone on the obsidian floor, the hall faded, sky vanished. But in your palm remains a single emerald orb, warm and glowing. You press it to your forehead, and understanding washes through you: the greatest mysteries are reflections of your own soul.

You wake before the orb cools, carrying its gentle light into your waking world—a silent promise that some doors open only when you answer their call from within.
