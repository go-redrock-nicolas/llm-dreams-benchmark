I am dreaming. I find myself on the threshold between worlds, standing on a bridge made of moonstone that glows with gentle iridescence. The bridge spans an impossible chasm—to my left, a landscape consumed by dancing flames that rise and fall like breathing creatures, their orange-gold tendrils reaching skyward in hypnotic patterns; to my right, a realm of crystalline ice formations that refract light into countless prismatic beams, beautiful but unforgivingly cold.

The sky above shifts constantly between twilight and dawn, never committing to either. Stars wink in and out of existence, forming constellations I somehow recognize despite never having seen them before. They spell out forgotten languages and equations that I momentarily understand with perfect clarity, only to lose comprehension in the next breath.

I can see moments from my life—and lives I've never lived—drifting past like autumn leaves on a current.

Their face is at once familiar and strange, aging and youthening with each step, wearing expressions of every emotion in rapid succession. They hold out a hand containing a seed that pulses with its own inner light.
