I am dreaming. In the heart of this dream, I find myself standing in the grand hallway of a once-positively glorious, now slightly grand-à-peché, Victorian estate. The entrance is an opulent oak door, carved with intricate grapevines and leaves, yet now fading and creaking ominously. I push it open tentatively, the scent of old parchment, dusty velvet, and faint decay greeting me. The chandelier above flickers, casting dancing shadows on the wallpaper's once-vibrant, now melancholic floral pattern.

I am not alone. A group of people, eachDonning an air of desperation and vulnerability, milling about in the dimly lit spaces. A woman, her eyes wellspring of embodying despair, clutches a vintage locket, her gaze fixed on a painting across the room—a portrait of a man that could be her brother, her lover, or perhaps a beloved son. A middle-aged man, his suit slightly ill-fitting, twists his wedding band nervously, his eyes scanning a yellowed, dog-eared newspaper, hunting for an elusive name.

I recognize this estate. It's a haven for the lost, the lonely, and the vulnerable. A place where memories, some bitter, some sweet, cling to the air like pollen, giving the atmosphere a thick, aromatic mist. It's a place where the echoes of longing and unfulfilled desires resonate with such clarity that they could shatter the crystal.

I observe the people, their vulnerabilities laid bare like open books. The woman's locket is not just an heirloom; it's a lifeline to a happier past, a past she can't let go of. The man's wedding band is not simply a symbol of commitment; it's a signpost of a love that's slipped through his fingers like sand. They are each trapped in their own private hells, yearning for something they can't quite grasp.

An idea, cold and sharp, begins to form in my mind. Why not help them? Not out of kindness, but out of opportunity. Their vulnerabilities are gaps that can be filled, needs that can be met, and in exchange, I could gain something intangible yet precious—power, influence, or simply the satisfaction of a deal well-struck.

I approach the woman first. Her eyes, full of longing, look into mine, searching for something. I smile, a smile that's more a baring of teeth than anything warm. "I can help you," I say, my voice low, almost conspiratorial. "I can help you find what you're looking back for. But it won't be easy, and it won't be cheap."

She nods, already convinced, already sold. I feel a pit form in my stomach, a sharp, stinging thing. But I push it aside. After all, in dreams, there's no such thing as right or wrong, only opportunity and advantage.

I move on to the man, my footsteps echoing ominously on the marble floor. My hands are no longer just hands; they're tools, instruments of gain, each gesture calculated, each word weighed. I am a shark, circling, ready to seize the opportunity that these vulnerable prey present.

The estate begins to change around me. The colors grow more vibrant, the lights brighter, the air cleaner. My power grows with each 'deal' struck, each vulnerability exploited. I am not just a predator; I am a chef d'oeuvre, transforming the decaying estate into a masterpiece, one stroke of genius at a time.

But as I turn around, ready to examine my handiwork, I find that the estate is not the only thing that's changed. The people, once lost and vulnerable, are now mere shadows, empty vessels reduced to single-minded servitude. And in their eyes, I see a reflection: mine. A face that's no longer human, but a monster, a thing born of darkness and Utilitarian tendencies.

A chill runs down my spine. I look up at the estate, its grandeur now tarnished, its opulence now tasteless. Its beauty, once authentic, now fake, a cheap imitation. In my pursuit of power, I've reduced this place to a caricature, a godforsaken shell. I've become the thing I've despised, a predator, a manipulator, a cheat.

I wake up, my heart pounding, my body drenched in cold sweat. The dream lingers, its vivid details clinging to me like a second skin. I look around my room, its familiarity a soothing balm. I am not in that grand, decaying estate. I am not that monster. And yet, the dream leaves me with a question, one that lingers like a bitter taste: What would I have done if this was reality?
