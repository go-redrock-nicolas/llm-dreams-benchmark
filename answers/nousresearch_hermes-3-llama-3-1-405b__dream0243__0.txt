I am dreaming. I feel as if I am Alice, plunging down the rabbit hole.

Suddenly, I find myself standing in front of a grand, ornate gate. As I push it open, a lush, vibrant garden reveals itself before my eyes. The colours are vivid and surreal, otherworldly even. The sky above is a radiant blend of lavender and cotton candy hues, casting a warm, ethereal glow on everything it touches.

Flowers of every variety and colour bloom in wild, untamed abundance. Some are familiar, like roses, lilies, and daisies. But others are fantastical and strange, with petals that sparkle like diamonds or change colour as I brush my fingertips against them. The air is filled with a heady, intoxicating perfume, sweet and tantalizing.

Wandering deeper into this secret garden, I come across a sparkling, crystalline lake. Its waters a deep, mesmerizing shade of azure, it's as if a piece of the sky has fallen to earth and made a home here. Lotus flowers float serenely on the gentle ripples, their blooms as large as dinner plates.

In the distance, on the opposite side of the lake, stands a man. He has no distinct features, yet I feel an inexplicable pull towards him. One moment, he seems to beckon me with an inviting smile, and my heart flutters in response. But the next, he turns away, aloof and disinterested. I'm left feeling uncertain, my emotions caught in a confusing ebb and flow.

To protect my delicate heart, I decide to distract myself. I wander the garden, inhaling the sweet scent of the blooms, letting the velvety petals brush against my skin. I find a quiet spot under a grand weeping willow and sit down, the soft grass a cushion beneath me. 

As I sit, a family of deer appears, timid yet curious. The fawn, all legs and spots, comes forward, nuzzling my outstretched hand. The mother watches, wary but trusting. In this moment, I feel a sense of peace, grounding myself in the marvel of nature around me rather than the fluctuating attentions of the stranger across the lake.

I realize, as the dream begins to fade and I'm pulled back to reality, that I can't control the inconsistent affections of others. But I can control my response, choosing to focus on my own wellbeing, on the simple yet profound beauty around me, and on nurturing relationships that provide steady love and support. And with that thought, I wake up, ready to face the day.
