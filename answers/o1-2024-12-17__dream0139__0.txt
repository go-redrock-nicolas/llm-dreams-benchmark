I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You drift into a place where the skies are the hue of bruised peaches, and the wind whispers in riddles you cannot quite parse. Here, airy towers made of rainbow-hued glass spiral up from the earth, warping in impossible loops. Their windows and doors unapologetically refuse to align. In this peculiar world, up is down, left is right, and your every instinct about what must make sense has been tossed out like crumpled paper. Conventional reasoning is met with looks of pity and disbelief, for in this place, the only respectable logic is illogic itself.

Citizens walk backward, carrying shimmering umbrellas that float an arm’s length above them. These umbrellas reflect clouds that behave like quicksilver. Sometimes the clouds untether themselves and mosey through the streets, grazing buildings. When people speak, their words leave their mouths as coiling ribbons that swirl around their heads, never quite fading, yet never fully manifesting. The citizens of this strange land pride themselves on their refusal to accept any straightforward ideas. An honest question—like “How are you?”—is answered not with a statement, but with a choreographed dance of contradiction and leaps of fancy.

To function in this backward realm, you must embrace what you once called nonsense. No longer can you rely solely on well-ordered thoughts. When walking along the crystalline pavement, if your foot lands in shadows, you might feel yourself slipping into a sense of ordinary cause-and-effect. That, in this society, is dangerous. They say that once you step wholeheartedly into logic, you disappear entirely, whisked away to some borderline reality. 

So you make yourself at home in decorative chaos. You begin each morning—however “morning” is defined indoors—by painting your dreams on an enormous canvas. Only, the paint will not stay still. It pulses with an inner glow, sliding around mischievously to form new shapes that contradict your original intentions. You find that if you let the image settle into nonsense, it suddenly reveals hidden truths. Sometimes it reveals pictures of your old world. Other times, it melts into fractal labyrinths that make your eyes ache in a marvelously pleasant way.

At midday, there is an unspoken festival in the streets, a swirling carnival of color and clashing symbols. Jugglers fling illusions—tiny dancing creatures made of living smoke—that swirl around your ankles and occasionally rise to argue with passersby in squeaks and chirps. Food does not nourish here in the logical sense; you eat sunbeams twisted into whimsical knots, or taste the spectrum of the starlight that glimmers off the ribbons. You no longer worry about “breakfast,” “lunch,” and “dinner,” as those words are too systematic. Instead, you nibble on confusion when you desire clarity, and your mind is sharper for it.

By afternoon, you attend the society’s schooling, which is a chaotic gathering rather than neat desks and chairs. Teachers, who themselves are crowned with swirling glass halos, greet you with paradoxical jokes. They cheer every time you present a solution that sounds outlandish and impossible—because to them, rational explanations are a sign of impending doom. You share tall tales that should not make sense, and their applause is thunderous. Whenever someone dares to produce a neat, linear conclusion, you hear concerned whispers snake through the crowd: “They’re losing their creative edge… They might disappear.” 

Evening is a time for recollection, and you venture into rooms made of living mirrors. On the other side of these mirrors sits your reflection, which behaves entirely on its own accord. You both discuss nonsense, ironically discovering revelations that put your daytime illusions into fresh perspective. If you speak too plainly, your reflection frowns and dims, vanishing into the mirror’s depths. It takes a dance of lyrical gibberish to coax it back into shining presence.

Eventually, you grow used to this perpetual unraveling of sense. You become adept at ignoring the compulsion to label things, letting your mind float on a sea of creative confusion. Each day is an opera of delightful absurdity and twisting illusions. The joke is on rational thinking. It becomes your second nature to question everything, then question your question, until the swirl of possibility sets you free.

And yet, somewhere deep within, you remember a place where the sky was an ordinary blue, where floors were trustworthy, and statements made sense. You recall a time you clung to logic as if it were a life raft in a dark ocean. Occasionally, the memory of that place lingers like a whisper in your sleepless nights, making you wonder if the impossibility of this dream is, in some other realm, quite real—and if your old reality is itself a strange reverie.  

For now, the kaleidoscopic realm spins and dances, and you spin with it, all rational anchors long swept away. You are dreaming, and it is a wonderful puzzle that cannot, and should not, ever be solved.
