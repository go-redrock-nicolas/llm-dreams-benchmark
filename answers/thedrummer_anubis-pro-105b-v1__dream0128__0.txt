I am dreaming. I am simultaneously learning seven different languages while preparing for an international diplomatic mission.

As my brain struggles with the linguistic overload, words and phrases from French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, German, and Portuguese swirl and blur together before my eyes like a colorfully design- 
Ins scrimmage. Proper nouns, verbs, and adjectives seep from one language into another in the rich broth of my mind.

My bookish persona sits at a brass-glazed burworld.boolean orderly writing desk putting the wan definitions together while an impatient interationative persona of myself stomps around the dusty library background restraining a growing argument against time.

"Say it, come on... The enlices cropped rain a wasmooth abvisator."
