I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with the scent of ozone and petrichor, as though the sky itself has cracked open to spill both lightning and rain. Beneath your feet, the ground is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different era: a knight’s visor glinting in a forgotten war, a child’s lost mitten tangled in a snowdrift, a star collapsing into a black hole. You step forward, and the mirrors sigh, rearranging themselves into a path that spirals upward—a stairway made of hourglasses, their sands cascading in reverse.  

At the summit looms a figure draped in antlers and starlight, their face a shifting tapestry of every ancestor you’ve never known. They hold a spear forged from glacial ice, its tip dripping with liquid constellations. “You seek the Well of Forgetting,” they intone, their voice echoing like a subterranean river. “But first, you must bargain with the Keeper of Names.” With a flick of their hand, the stairway dissolves into a forest of towering obelisks, each engraved with words that writhe like serpents.  

You wander this petrified library until a laugh fractures the silence—a sound both merry and malicious. Before you stands a man with a fox’s grin and eyes like smoldering coals, his skin etched with runes that bleed gold. Loki, or something like him, though his fingers end in quills that drip ink. “Lost, little scribe?” he purrs, tossing a dice carved from bone into the air. It multiplies, clattering across the stones to spell out *TRAITOR* in a language you feel in your marrow. “Roll again,” he urges, “or let me write your next chapter.” You refuse, and he vanishes in a plume of crows, leaving a single feather that burns to reveal a map tattooed on your palm.  

The map guides you to a cavern where the walls pulse like living flesh. Inside, a woman sits atop a throne woven from roots and rusted swords. Her hair is a swarm of locusts, her lips stained with pomegranate blood. Hecate, or Persephone reborn—she wears the weight of both. “You’ve come to forget,” she says, her voice honeyed with contempt, “but memory is a hydra. Cut one head, and regret grows in its place.” She offers two vials: one filled with liquid shadow, the other with a brew that hums with forgotten lullabies. You hesitate, then drink the shadow. It tastes of absolution.  

The cavern collapses. You fall into a desert where the dunes are made of teeth, each grain whispering fragments of old vows. A jackal with a pharaoh’s headdress pads beside you, its tail flickering like a dying torch. Anubis, or his echo, silent as a tomb. He leads you to a scale balanced on the horizon, its pans holding a sparrow’s feather and a mountain of lies. You step onto the scale, and it tips neither way—it *sings*, a low, resonant note that unravels your bones into stardust.  

Then, silence.  

You awaken on a bridge of suspended animation—a tightrope strung between a burning sun and a dying moon. Below, a dragon coils in the void, its scales the color of unspoken fears. It is you, and it is not. It roars, and the sound is your own voice, fractured by every lie you’ve told yourself. You leap, not to fight but to embrace it, and the dragon dissolves into a flock of doves, each carrying a mirror shard that reflects your face as it might have been, as it could be, as it *is*.  

The dream fractures. You wake in your bed, the taste of shadow still on your tongue, a single feather smoldering in your fist. Somewhere, a fox laughs. Somewhere, a goddess smiles. You are different now—stitched together from the loom of archetypes, a tapestry of endings and commencements. The modern world feels smaller, sharper, as though its skin is just another mask worn by the ancient, hungry dark. And you? You are both the hero and the myth, the scribe and the quill, forever walking the bridge between what was and what might yet be dreamed.
