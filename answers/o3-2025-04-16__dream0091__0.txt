I am dreaming. …I take one last breath and push open the silver-leafed doors.

The room beyond is impossible geometry: vaulted ceilings arc into star-flecked night instead of plaster; aquamarine rivers coil across mid-air like transparent ribbons; whole constellations pulse in time with my heartbeat. At the center floats a crystalline stage, gently spinning. My creation lies atop it: a miniature planet glowing with molten dawns and violet oceans, tiny auroras swirling over snow-dusted peaks. I feel its warmth through the soles of my feet.

The critics assemble along the riverbanks—luminous silhouettes stitched from quills, spectacles, and ink. Their faces are parchment masks, their eyes obsidian wells. Whenever they exhale, sentences spill out in curling calligraphy that disperse like fireflies. A hush settles, so soft it feels like snowfall on my shoulders.

I step onto the platform. The planet hums—a lullaby of thunderclaps and birdsong. With a tilt of my hand, it blooms open: continents unfurl like paper cranes; deserts ripple and reveal skeletal coral reefs made of neon glass; cloud-herds stampede, leaving trails of glittering rain. I twist my wrist again, and a towering library sprouts from the equator—shelves rotating, ladders gliding, leather spines breathing in anticipation.

The critics lean closer, filled with predator-stillness. Their quills extend into serrated beaks, preparing to dissect every trembling detail. My pulse becomes a tribal drum. I fear they’ll enumerate flaws, tear the dream-planet into ribbons of inadequacy.

Sweat blossoms, but then I notice something: the planet is listening to me—mirroring my emotions. When dread creeps up my spine, storms swirl at the poles; when hope sparks, sunrise ignites across its grasslands. I realize this world is anchored to my courage.

So I decide to speak not to the critics, but to the planet itself.

“Grow,” I whisper.

It answers. Rivers climb waterfalls that ascend through empty sky, forming calligraphy the critics can’t decode. Jungles sprout bioluminescent syllables, spelling forgiveness. Mountains crack open, releasing shoals of silver fishes that swim through thin air. My creation sings in a language made of wind chimes, erasing the critics’ parchment faces, wiping their ink-laden judgments from the air.

The silhouettes gape—then something stranger happens. One by one, their masks peel back, revealing—not snarling judges—but children, eyes wide, cheeks freckled with wonder and moonlight. Their quills soften into hummingbird feathers. They hover, transfixed, no longer critics but curious guests.

Encouraged, I step off the stage and dive headfirst into the lavender ocean. Water feels like warm silk. Schools of origami squids swirl around me, scrawling handwritten compliments that dissolve into bubbles. When I surface, the children are applauding, throwing armfuls of starlight that cascade like confetti.

In that moment, the room’s impossible geometry untangles. The rivers settle into shimmering canals; the ceiling crystallizes into a dawn-kissed sky; the planet folds back into my palms, now no larger than a glowing marble. I tuck it behind my heartbeat.

A bell made of pure silence rings.

The silver-leafed doors open again, revealing not another trial, but an endless orchard of glowing idea-seeds, each dangling like lanterns. I understand: every seed is a new dream begging to be grown, and every critic is merely a future child thirsty for wonder.

With a brave grin, I pocket a fistful of lantern-seeds and step through, ready to plant galaxies wherever courage takes root.

Then I wake—hand unclenched, but fingertips still warm with starlight.
