I am dreaming. These hardships have been relentless, a storm that refuses to dissipate, leaving me battered but not yet broken.  

Tonight, exhaustion finally overtakes me, and my weary body gives in to sleep. Slowly, the world melts away—the creak of the old house settling, the hum of distant traffic, the weight of my thoughts—until all that remains is a deep, velvety blackness.  

And then, I'm falling.  

Not the terrifying, stomach-lurching drop of a nightmare, but a gentle descent, like floating on unseen currents of air. Below me, an ocean stretches infinitely, its surface mirror-calm and glowing with an eerie, bioluminescent light—not blue, but a shifting iridescence of emerald and silver. The stars above aren’t pinpricks of light but vast, swirling galaxies, close enough that I could reach out and scoop a handful of shimmering stardust.  

A voice hums through the air, neither male nor female, ancient nor young—just *there*, vibrating in my bones. It doesn’t speak in words but in sensations, in colors that swirl behind my eyelids. *You are held.* And impossibly, I believe it.  

Then, the ocean ripples. Not in waves, but in great, smooth undulations, as though something vast and unseen moves just beneath the surface. A bridge of luminous stone rises from the water, arching gracefully toward a distant island where crystalline trees sway in a wind I cannot feel. Their leaves chime like glass, a haunting melody that resonates with the deepest parts of my soul.  

I step onto the bridge, and it warms beneath my bare feet, humming in recognition. *You are known*, it seems to whisper. Ahead, a figure stands at the midpoint of the span, cloaked in shifting veils of twilight. Their face is indistinct, but their presence is—comforting. Familiar, even.  

"You’ve carried the weight long enough," they say, though their mouth never moves. Their voice is every childhood lullaby, every firelit conversation, every whispered secret.  

When I try to answer, I realize I have no voice here. Instead, my thoughts take shape in the air—silver ribbons of memory, fear, hope—twisting and spiraling upward. The figure reaches out, catching one strand between their fingers.  

"Some burdens are not meant to be shouldered alone."  

And like that, the dream shifts—without warning, without fear. The island is suddenly before me, the trees parting to reveal a clearing where a table sits, laden with foods I don’t recognize but somehow *know*: fruits that spark like slow-burning coals, bread that smells like home, wine dark as a new moon. Around the table, shadows sit—faceless but warm, their laughter ringing like wind chimes.  

One turns to me, and though they have no eyes, I feel their gaze. "Sit," they say. "Eat. Let the world wait awhile longer."  

And I do.  

The taste is indescribable, like nostalgia and promise blended into every bite. The shadows tell stories—not in words, but in flashes of shared emotion, fragments of memory that could be mine or someone else’s entirely. It doesn’t matter.  

For the first time in years, I feel—light.  

Then, softly, the dream begins to fade. The island shimmers like mist under morning sun; the stars dim. The voice returns one last time, wrapping around me like a cloak.  

*You will remember this place when you wake.*  

And against all odds, I do.
