I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds:**  

You stand in a vast, twilight-lit valley where the sky pulses with hues of indigo and molten gold, as if caught between sunset and midnight. The air hums with the faint whisper of unseen wings, and underfoot, the ground shimmers like crushed opals. Before you rests a **locked box**, ancient and enigmatic, carved from wood so dark it seems to drink in the fading light.  

The moment your fingers brush its surface, the intricate patterns coiled along its sides **twitch and shift**, slithering like living things—serpents of silver and ivy-thin scripts in languages long forgotten. The lock is a puzzle of impossible geometry, its keyhole shaped like a **labyrinth within a rose**, spiraling inward forever.  

A voice that is not a voice murmurs in your bones: *"Only the key you already hold may open what was never closed."*  

Then—**you remember the weight in your pocket.** A key, warm as a heartbeat, pressed into your palm by no hand you’ve ever seen. It burns against your skin as you lift it, watching the metal ripple between shapes—a tooth, a thorn, the skeleton of a falling star.  

The moment the key touches the lock, the box **splits open with a sigh**, not in halves, but in *directions*—unfolding inward, outward, into a space that shouldn’t exist. Inside, there is no object, no treasure. Only **an echo of your own voice**, calling back from somewhere deep within the box… and the creeping realization that *you* are the one who locked it.  

And then—**you wake.** The scent of damp earth and distant lightning lingers. Your hand is clenched around something cold and sharp. You dare not look.
