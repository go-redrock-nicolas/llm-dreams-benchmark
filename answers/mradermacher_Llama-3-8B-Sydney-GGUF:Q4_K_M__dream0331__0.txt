I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful garden full of flowers and trees.  The air is fresh and fragrant.  The sun is
shining brightly overhead.  I feel happy and carefree.

Suddenly, I realize that I am not alone.  I see two shadowy figures approaching me from the other end of the garden.  They
are eerily silent and motionless, except for their eyes, which glow redly in the darkness.  They seem to be stalking me.

I try to run away, but my feet are anchored to the ground by invisible bonds.  I scream for help, but no sound comes out of
my mouth.  I feel terror and helplessness engulfing me.

Then, I see a familiar face appear before me.  It is an old friend who has long ago disappeared from my life.  He looks at
me with concern and compassion in his eyes.

"Help me," I whisper pleadingly.
He extends his hand toward me.
As soon as our hands touch, everything changes.

The garden disappears, replaced by a vast wasteland of desolation and despair.  The sky is dark and cloudy, filled with
howling winds and raging storms.  The ground is rocky and uneven, covered with thorns and spikes.

I am standing next to my friend, who now appears in full form as a human being wearing a white robe and a crown of thorns.
He looks at me with understanding and empathy in his eyes.

"I know what you are going through," he says softly.  "I know how difficult it is for you to let go of the past and embrace
the future."
He reaches out again, this time, to touch my face gently with his fingers.

When our skin makes contact, I feel a warm tingling sensation spread throughout my body.  My fears disappear, replaced by
a sense of peace and acceptance.

As we stand there together in silence, I begin to realize something important:

Despite all the changes that have taken place around us, despite all the challenges that await us ahead, despite all the
dangers that threaten us from outside world, despite even death itself...
