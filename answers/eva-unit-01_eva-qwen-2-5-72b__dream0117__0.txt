I am dreaming. In my dream, the sky is cloudless with an unhealthy, incandescent glow. I watch transfixed as an enormous crack in space begins to slice through the atmosphere, materializing larger by the second. From this fissure, a magnificent alien creature emerges, translucent and ever-shifting, filling the skyline.  

I'm standing in the middle of a bustling market square, and the crowd has gone silent, their gazes fixed upwards. The air has stilled around us, as if pausing for what's to come. I try to speak, to warn them to run, but no sound emanates from my lips. 

Panic ripples through the crowd as they collectively realize the gravity of the situation. Shouts of terror erupt from every direction, and chaos erupts as people attempt to flee. Yet, I remain rooted to the spot, unable to move.

Seconds feel like minutes, and minutes stretch into hours as I watch the magnificent being descend, its tentacles brushing the spires of buildings. Time inexplicably slows, granting me a moment of clarity. 

I am the only one who knows the truth: that we have precisely one hour until the end. But no one heeds my warning; I am unnoticed, insignificant even while shouting at the top of my lungs. In the face of this catastrophe, I remain calm, some might even say serene.

I watch them rush about, trying desperately to piece together the truth, while I, the only one who knows, must remain still. The seconds continue to creep by – each of them now a precious gem – until finally, the creature unleashes a sound that transcends comprehension, reverberating deep within my bones.

And then, everything goes black.
