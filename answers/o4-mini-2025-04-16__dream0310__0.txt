I am dreaming. I find myself standing barefoot on polished lava-stone tiles that glow faintly beneath my feet, as though the earth itself were breathing light up through me. Before me stretches an open hall, its pillars carved from pale jade, each etched with spirals and birds in flight. A gentle breeze scents the air with resin and night-blooming flowers I have never smelled before. Lanterns of woven bamboo hang in rows, their rice-paper shades painted with crimson lotuses that seem to ripple as people pass beneath them.

I am out of place here—this is a ceremony from a tradition not my own—but the gathering moves around me with an easy confidence that feels strangely welcoming. Soft chanting rises in waves, a melody carried on a language I cannot name. The voices loop from deep, wooden drums to a high, tremulous flute, and I sense my heartbeat slowing to match their rhythm. Someone presses a small metal bell into my hand; its surface is cool, engraved with symbols I cannot decipher. A kind-eyed woman in amber robes nods to me, inviting me forward.

We step together to a low platform tiled with mother-of-pearl mosaics. Here, I take my place beside the dancers: slender figures draped in sheer silks of violet and teal, each moving in time to the pulse of the music. They circle me in a slow, hypnotic pattern, waving incense burners that trail ghostly plumes of smoke. As the smoke curls around my arms, I breathe it in—its taste is sweet, like honey tinted with saffron—and feel it fill my lungs with warmth.

The chant swells. I am handed a wooden mask carved into the face of an ancient guardian spirit: eyes slanted, mouth half-open in silent song. I press it to my face. Through its hollow gaze-holes, the world tilts into kaleidoscopic color—jade becomes emerald, saffron becomes gold, and the floor beneath us seems to ripple like water. The drums thunder, and I feel my own voice rise in the chant, surging from somewhere deeper than thought. The words come unbidden, an offering from my lips to this unfamiliar deity.

Suddenly the lantern light brightens until it floods the hall in a single wave. Our dancers part, revealing a shallow pool at the center of the platform. Its water glitters like quicksilver, reflecting both the carved pillars and the infinite night sky above. An androgynous priest in white silk glides to the edge, motioning for me to kneel. With trembling hands, I dip mine into the liquid silver; it is neither hot nor cold but alive with a soft hum, as though it carries a pulse of its own.

When I lift my hand, it drips the shimmering liquid like stars falling one by one onto the stone. Every drop lights up the tiles, sending ripples of iridescent pattern racing outward. I watch, mesmerized, as the mosaics dance and shift—flowers blooming, birds taking flight, rivers flowing toward distant mountains I have never seen. In that moment, I sense a tapestry of connections: between the temple and the sky, between my heartbeat and the drums, between my voice and the cosmos.

The chant dissolves into a single, soaring note. The priest leans close, whispering in that strange tongue. Though I do not understand the words, I feel their meaning sink into me: gratitude, transformation, unity. I rise, unmasking myself, and the congregation closes in. They place fragrant garlands of jasmine around my neck, drape silk scarves over my shoulders, and press a warm loaf of sweet rice bread into my hands. I taste it, and memories long forgotten—of childhood summers, of first joys and old griefs—rise to the surface of my mind.

The ceremony ends as the final echo of the chant fades. In silence, we step off the platform together, lanterns in hand, and file out into a courtyard where lanterns float on black water. The reflection of the moon trembles on the surface. I release my lantern, watch it drift across the pond, and in its soft glow I feel myself woven forever into this sacred tapestry. Then, as dreams will, it begins to dissolve—the lantern, the hall of jade columns, even the memory of that silver pool—and I awaken with the taste of incense still on my tongue.
