I am dreaming. The sky pulses in hues of bruised purple and liquid gold, swirling like ink dropped into water. The wind carries voices that murmur in reverse, whispers unraveling sentences backward before they reach my ears. The buildings here twist like paper curling in a flame, their foundations floating inches above the ground, defying gravity purely out of spite.  

I walk down the cobbled street—except the cobbles are made of soft, breathing flesh, expanding and contracting beneath my feet. People pass by, their faces shifting like melted wax, features rearranging each time I blink. A woman with fingers growing out of her palms like tree branches laughs as she feeds coins into a mailbox, cooing to it like a pet. A man walks upside-down, his feet glued to the sky, while his shadow stretches upward, standing rigid on the ground as if *it* were the real person.  

In this world, sense is sin. To speak plainly is to invite ridicule, and to walk in a straight line is the height of lunacy. I see a street vendor selling emotions wrapped in newspaper—joy is bitter, anger tastes like honey, and logic is a forbidden spice, confiscated by the Bureau of Unreasonable Affairs. A child weaves a kite from broken mirrors, giggling as it catches sunlight and shatters the sky into jagged reflections.  

I must adapt. To survive here, I must unlearn reason. I approach a stall where a merchant sells thoughts in glass bottles—each one wriggling like trapped fireflies. He grins, his teeth spiraling like seashells, and says, **"Your mind is too heavy. Trade it for something lighter—maybe a song that evaporates as soon as you hum it?"**  

I hesitate. Then, with a deep breath, I let go of coherence. My thoughts unravel like yarn, turning into floating nonsense. I laugh as the ground ripples like water beneath me. The stars below my feet twinkle in approval.  

The dream shifts. Now, I belong.
