I am dreaming. I'm sitting in a leather chair, warm amber light filtering through gauzy curtains that dance gently in the breeze. Across from me, separated by a small oak table holding two untouched cups of tea, is someone whose face keeps shifting—sometimes clear, sometimes blurred by what seems like emotional static.

They're crumbling before me, words tumbling out between ragged breaths. Their hands tremble as they speak of loss that feels bottomless, of a darkness that's been following them through doorways and around corners. Tears catch the light as they fall.

I feel an unusual weightiness in my chest—not just empathy, but something deeper. As I listen, the room begins to subtly transform. The walls breathe in and out, the bookshelf behind them fills with titles that weren't there moments before. A clock ticks, but its hands move counterclockwise.

When I open my mouth to respond, I discover I know profound truths I've never consciously considered. Words flow from me with unusual clarity, as if someone else's wisdom is channeling through me. Each phrase I speak causes ripples of color to spread across the ceiling.

The person before me begins to transform as they listen—their shoulders straighten, their breathing steadies, their eyes begin to reflect light rather than absorb it. A metamorphosis happens before me, and somehow I understand that by helping them heal, some wounded part of myself is also being restored.

The boundary between us thins. For a moment, I can't remember which chair I'm sitting in or whose tears were falling. The room expands impossibly, the walls now distant horizons, as if this small moment of human connection contains entire universes.
