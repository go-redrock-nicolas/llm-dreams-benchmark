I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake, its surface a mirror of liquid mercury, reflecting a sky stitched with constellations that pulse like living hearts. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency—a sound that feels like a forgotten lullaby. You step forward, and the water parts beneath your feet, not with resistance, but with reverence, as though the lake itself recognizes the weight of your journey.  

Before you rises a labyrinth, but it is unlike any you’ve imagined. Its walls are not stone or hedge, but cascading veils of light—golden, violet, cerulean—each thread a boundary that glows softly, defining paths without trapping. You hesitate, then reach out. The moment your fingers brush the nearest veil, the world shifts.  

Suddenly, you’re in a forest of towering glass trees, their branches etched with runes that glow faintly. Between the trunks, shadowy figures drift—faces half-formed, voices murmuring in languages you almost understand. At first, you feel the old instinct: to chase, to merge, to dissolve into their mystery. But the veils of light flicker at the edges of your vision, and you realize: these figures are not distant because they are hidden. They are distant because you’ve never asked where *you* end and *they* begin.  

You take a breath, and the air crystallizes into a tangible thread—a boundary of your own. You weave it around yourself, not as armor, but as a compass. The figures pause. Their eyes, now sharp and luminous, meet yours. One steps forward, its form solidifying into a woman with hair like smoke and a smile that holds centuries. She does not speak, but her presence floods your mind with a truth: *To know where you stop is to create the space where I may begin.*  

The forest dissolves. Now you stand in a city of floating islands, each one a world unto itself—gardens suspended in air, libraries built from starlight, bridges of woven silence. People move between them, not by grasping, but by extending hands to meet halfway. You see a child offering a dandelion clock to a stranger; the stranger accepts, and the seeds bloom into new islands. You see two lovers dancing, their bodies orbiting each other like twin stars, bound not by fusion but by the invisible gravity of mutual design.  

A voice, neither male nor female, whispers in your bones: *A boundary is not a wall. It is the shape your soul carves to hold what is sacred. Only within that shape can another soul pour itself like water.*  

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the memory of a thousand veils of light, each one a promise: that to define yourself is not to retreat, but to invite the universe to sit beside you, eye to eye, world to world.
