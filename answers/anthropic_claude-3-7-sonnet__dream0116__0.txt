I am dreaming. I'm inside a vast library with impossibly high ceilings, shelves reaching toward stained glass skylights that cast kaleidoscopic patterns across ancient tomes. When the first tremor hits, the floor ripples like water, and the world falls silent before a deafening crack splits the air. The building groans—a living entity wounded—as massive wooden shelves topple in slow motion, creating a domino effect of cascading knowledge.

I dive beneath a heavy oak table as plaster rains from above, the air thickening with centuries of dust. The second tremor is fiercer, and the floor simply disappears beneath me. I'm falling, tumbling with others—strangers whose faces seem oddly familiar—into darkness punctuated by falling debris and fractured light.

We land in what must be the basement archives. Concrete pillars have collapsed, forming a cavern of rubble above us. A thin shaft of dusty sunlight penetrates our tomb, illuminating five survivors including myself. The air is dense, each breath shallow and insufficient, tasting of limestone and fear.

A woman in a blue dress, her face half-shadowed, begins to whisper calculations about our remaining oxygen. An elderly man with kind eyes clutches a leather-bound journal to his chest, as if it might save him. A teenager, unnervingly calm, traces patterns in the dust.

As our breathing synchronizes in the small space, I notice something strange—the books scattered around us have begun to glow with a soft phosphorescence. Their spilled pages flutter without wind, and the words—the words are crawling across the paper, reforming into maps that show not our location, but impossible landscapes: mountains that breathe, oceans suspended in air.

The boundaries between us begin to blur. I can feel the woman's mathematical mind, the old man's lifetime of memories, the teenager's boundless imagination. Our consciousness pools together as the oxygen thins, and suddenly I understand—we aren't trapped. We're transforming.

The rubble above is not concrete and steel but the weight of perception. As we let go of panic, our collective breath becomes a wind that lifts the pages higher, swirling around us in a literary cyclone. The glowing words detach from their pages, becoming particles of light that sink into our skin like luminous rainfall.

The walls of our prison begin to dissolve, not crumbling but transmuting into something else entirely—a forest of crystalline trees, a city of impossible geometry, an ocean of thoughts where we float, no longer separate individuals but a shared dream that has forgotten its dreamer.
