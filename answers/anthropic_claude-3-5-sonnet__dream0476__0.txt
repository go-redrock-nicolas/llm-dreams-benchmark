I am dreaming. ....

I find myself in a vast chamber made entirely of mirrored glass, each surface reflecting infinite versions of myself stretching into eternity. The air feels thick and heavy with unspoken words, like storm clouds waiting to burst. As I move through this crystalline maze, I notice that each reflection shows a slightly different expression - some are weeping, others laughing, some twisted in rage, while others radiate pure joy.

But there's one reflection that keeps catching my eye, though I desperately try to look away. In this particular mirror, I see myself curled into a tight ball, vulnerable and small, radiating a profound loneliness that I've been running from for so long. The emotion emanates from the glass like waves of electric blue energy, reaching out to touch me.

Every time I try to turn away, new mirrors slide into place, forcing me to confront this reflection. My heart pounds against my chest as the feeling of isolation grows stronger, more insistent. The air becomes harder to breathe, crystallizing in my lungs like delicate frost.

Suddenly, the reflection steps out of its mirror, becoming three-dimensional. It walks toward me with arms outstretched, tears streaming down its face. I want to run, but my feet are rooted to the ground. As it approaches, I feel the walls of resistance I've built beginning to crumble.

When it finally reaches me, it doesn't speak - it simply wraps its arms around me in an embrace. The moment we touch, the mirrors around us shatter into millions of tiny diamonds, floating in the air like suspended starlight. The loneliness I've been avoiding crashes through me like a tidal wave, but instead of drowning me, it feels like a release - painful yet purifying.

The floating shards of mirror begin to sing, each one carrying a different note of a haunting melody that seems to say: "You were never truly alone. Your fear of loneliness was keeping you lonely."

As the dream begins to fade, I notice that the reflections in each floating shard now show the same image - myself, whole and integrated, finally at peace with all the emotions I contain...
