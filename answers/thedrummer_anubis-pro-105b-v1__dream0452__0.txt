I am dreaming. find myself standing on a cliff overlooking a vast expanse of the ocean. The sky is painted in hues of twilight, with shades of indigo slowly blending into hues of lavender and gold. 

Before me, I see a boat, its once-cherished wooden frame now weathered and cracked. The sail, which had once billowed with wind, now flails limp against the mast. I can feel the breeze whispering remorse, as if it itself is grieved by the changes the boat has endured.

As I watch, a figure emerges from within the boat's hull. It's the reflection of a relationship that was once full of life and vitality, but now appears worn and faded. The figure's skin is wilting, and its once-luminous eyes now seem dim and hollow. Its voice calls out, but the words dissolve before reaching my ears, a stark contrast to the meaningful conversations we once shared.

I remember the days when the boat sailed across serene waters, propelling both of us forward in our journey. The boat's oar would dip neatly into the water, and we'd smile at each other, an unspoken understanding that our strength and determination were our greatest sails. Over time, though, the waves of challenges we faced began to destroy the wooden seams, leaving gaps where the water would seep in, making traversing more and more difficult.

Stepping back from the cliff, I close my eyes and am transported to a familiar path I once traversed with this person. The trail was once lined with vibrant wildflowers, their colors dancing in the sunlight. Now, it's overgrown with weeds, choking out any remaining life. With each step, memories resurface - and while some are pleasant, others leave behind a tinge of regret and sorrow.  
I open my eyes, and I'm back on the cliff, the weathered boat and it's worn figure still before me. I clench my fists, not in anger, but in the growing understanding that some things - like this relationship - have an expiration date. Their once precious existence could not last, and to hold onto the illusion that it could only prolong the inevitable pain for both parties involved.

Slowly, I turn around, as if wandering further and further from the bluff. With my back to the crashing waves, I hold my head high and let out a deep sigh, releasing all the pent-up feelings of loss and anger. Some dreams fade away, defensively CHAPTER one, and it isn't always easy. But parting ways can sometimes be the only move that allows room for true, presently excellent relationships to form, and for internally personal growth to occur.
