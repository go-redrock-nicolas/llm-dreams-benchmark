I am dreaming. the hush before the storm, when the world holds its breath and the veil between waking and wonder thins.

It begins in a garden—not of flowers, but of hourglasses. Sand trickles in rainbows, spiraling upward instead of down, each grain a memory, a moment, a possibility. I walk barefoot through this surreal orchard, the air thick with the scent of time—old books, warm cedar, and the faint whisper of thunder that doesn’t belong to any sky. There is no sun, only a soft silver glow emanating from the branches above, illuminating everything in a light that feels like nostalgia.

And there—it’s *that* feeling. The one I carry in waking life but never name. The weight and wonder of change. Deep in this dream, it has shape: a luminous heart hangs in the air beside me, suspended and pulsing gently, half gleaming gold, half shadowy black. Each beat resonates like a bell under water—an echo of both grief and joy, fear and freedom.

Then, a figure steps from behind a tree, their silhouette formed of moving constellations, swirling with galaxies that blink and breathe. They don’t speak with words, but plant a mirror in my hands—warm, like it’s alive. The surface ripples like liquid mercury. When I look into it, I don’t see myself—I see rooms from my life, past and future opening like petals: laughter around a kitchen table, one suitcase half-packed, two ticket stubs fluttering in a drawer like wings, the golden light of an airplane window at sunrise.

The conflicting emotions rise like the tide—love and terror, excitement and loss, all cycling like the ocean. The dream doesn’t try to resolve it. It doesn’t flatten the duality—it *cradles* it.

I move deeper into the garden. The hourglasses begin to break, showers of crystal scattering across my skin like stars. But the grains do not fall—they float, gather, and reshape into birds—avian swarms of memory and possibility spiraling into the twilight sky above me. I hear laughter, weeping, applause, and silence—all at once, all in harmony.

And beneath it all, a feeling—as vast and quiet as the core of the Earth—that says: be here. Feel it all. All of it is sacred.

And just as the first bird lands softly on my shoulder, its wings humming with all that was lost and all that’s found... I wake.
