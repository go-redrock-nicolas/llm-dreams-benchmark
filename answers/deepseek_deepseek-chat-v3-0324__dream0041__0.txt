I am dreaming. 10 different white roses blossom from the moss beside me. 

In my dream, the air shimmers with iridescent particles as I stand in a grand auditorium that seems to breathe—walls expanding and contracting like a living organism. The ceiling stretches infinitely into a cosmic expanse where constellations pulse in time with my accelerating heartbeat. My audience isn’t human; they’re towering figures woven from shadow and starlight, their faceless silhouettes leaning forward in anticipation. 

Just as panic grips me, ten luminescent white roses burst through the emerald moss at my feet, their petals unfurling with audible sighs. Each blossom emits a soft, silver glow that illuminates cryptic symbols dancing across their petals—a language I somehow know is both a warning and an invitation. The largest rose opens fully to reveal a tiny doorway inside its stigma, from which a whispering voice urges me to crawl through. Around me, time distorts—the audience freezes mid-gesture as if the universe has paused to witness my decision. 

The moss beneath me becomes a living carpet, creeping up my legs with gentle insistence. I realize the roses aren’t just flowers; they’re guardians of some primordial knowledge, offering absolution or oblivion. As I reach toward the petal-doorway, the scent of the roses transforms—now earthy and ancient, like uncovered parchment from a forgotten library at the world’s edge. My hesitation crumbles when the blossoms begin harmonizing in a wordless melody that resonates in my marrow, pulling me toward the threshold where preparation won’t matter—only surrender will.
