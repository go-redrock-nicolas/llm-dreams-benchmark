I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a luminous forest, where the light is neither harsh nor dim, but dances with a gentle, inviting glow. The trees here are unlike any I've seen before, their trunks a kaleidoscope of swirling colors and their leaves shimmering in hues of impossible iridescence. Each step I take seems to echo with the soft melody of unseen whispers, carrying promises of mysteries yet to unfold.

The path before me is paved with smooth river stones, glistening with a faint, enchanted gleam. As I walk down this path, I feel a familiar weight upon my shoulders, a sense of responsibilities piled higher than I can bear. Yet, alongside this burden, I also sense a new resolve rising within me, whispering of boundaries unclaimed.

Suddenly, the forest opens into a clearing bathed in silvery moonlight, where a serene pond mirrors the sky above. At the center of the pond, a figure emerges—an ethereal mirage of myself, a reflection of my deepest awareness and understanding. This reflection looks at me with eyes filled with compassion and knowing, acknowledging the struggles of my waking life and the constant urge to give more than I possess.

"You have always over-committed," the reflection says, its voice the gentle rustle of leaves in a warm breeze. "But here, in this realm of dreams, you can learn what eludes you in the waking world."

As I watch, the reflection waves a graceful hand, and in her palm appears a tiny, glowing sphere. It is a boundary—an ethereal, malleable thing, shimmering with potential and clarity. "This is your new boundary," the reflection explains. "Come, let it guide you."

I reach out slowly, brushing my fingers against the luminous orb, and in an instant, I feel an extraordinary sense of liberation. The weight upon my shoulders lessens as I see overlapping, interlocking circles spread out before me in a stunning, circular dance—a visual of balance and harmony.

The boundaries are simple yet profound, lines drawn not to confine, but to uphold. Each circle represents commitments I can handle without strain, allowing space for tranquility and creativity. I see them settle around me, woven into the fabric of this remarkable forest, offering both guidance and freedom.

With newfound clarity, I stand, no longer burdened by the multitude of tasks pulled from my waking world. Instead, I feel enveloped by an air of deliberate intention—a path forward that is guided not by external demands, but by a serene inner wisdom that knows my true limits.

The forest begins to fade, its vibrant colors softening into the gentle hues of dawn. I sense the dream slipping away, leaving behind threads of insight and an inner resolve to cherish as I wake. The knowledge of setting realistic boundaries lingers, a timeless star in the vast tapestry of my heart and mind, promising a life of balance and joy. As I awaken, I carry these gifts from the dream—a commitment, this time, to myself.
