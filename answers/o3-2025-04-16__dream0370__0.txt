I am dreaming. …reach out—not with hands, because in this dream your touch is made of light and song.  
The scene around you is a cathedral of shifting color: pillars of amethyst swirl upward into a sky that looks like liquid dawn, and every breath you take tastes faintly of cedar smoke and salt.  

At the center of this swirling sanctuary kneels the other dream-wanderer. Their shoulders quake with an invisible weight; their ribcage glows a trembling silver, as though their fears are fireflies trying to escape. You feel their sorrow ripple across the floor like moonlit water, and the ache in your own chest blooms open, vast and tender.

You step closer. With each footfall, carpets of moss and tiny blue flowers sprout—proof that empathy itself is fertile. When you finally stand behind them, your shadow merges with theirs, weaving a living tapestry of two silhouettes sewn together at the heart.

There is no language here, only music. So you sing, but the song is silence shaped like kindness. It pours from you in translucent ribbons, wrapping the kneeling figure. You watch their breathing steady; the silver at their ribs softens to a warm amber glow. When they rise, they do so slowly, as though gravity has agreed to let them go.

Now you notice that the cathedral is no building at all—it is a living forest of colossal wind-chimes. Each trunk is a hollow crystal column, and every time a breeze threads through, the air rings with low, harmonic chimes. The two of you exchange a glance, and your shared vulnerability becomes permission: together you exhale, and the chimes erupt into a symphony that braids your heartbeats into the percussion.

The dream shifts again. The forest unfurls into an ocean made of polished obsidian. Stars float on its surface like lanterns. The person beside you extends their hand, and this time your fingers are feathers. Together you step onto the black-glass water, unafraid of shattering it. With every step, petals bloom beneath your feet—hot reds, fierce golds, colors that do not exist outside of sleep. The petals spread across the sea, and suddenly you realize they form a word visible only from the heavens: “Belonging.”

The vulnerable stranger turns to you. Their face morphs—no longer singular, but a kaleidoscope of everyone you have ever loved or lost. You understand: their fragility mirrors your own, and in honoring it, you heal the fracture in you. A tear, bright as comet-tail, slips from their eye, and as it lands, the obsidian sea melts into clear water. Fish of living starlight swim beneath, like constellations learning to breathe.

A gentle wind carries the scent of childhood summers—sun-warmed strawberries, damp earth after rain. The stranger smiles, and you feel the smile seed itself in your bones. Roots of tranquility spread through your limbs. You realize the dream is offering you a gift: the knowledge that tenderness is strength disguised as softness.

You close your eyes, letting the symphony of chimes and water lull you. When you open them again, dawn filters through your bedroom curtains. But the perfume of cedar smoke and the memory of starlight fish linger on your tongue, and you know something inside you has rearranged itself—deeper, brighter, unbreakably gentle.
