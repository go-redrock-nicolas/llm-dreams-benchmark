I am dreaming.

At first, I am wandering a labyrinth that glows faintly blue and silver, the soft luminescence pulsing in time with my heart. Each turn and corridor echoes with whispers—old regrets, sharp critiques, the biting things I’ve told myself in moments of failure. The labyrinth seems endless, its walls shifting imperceptibly, reliving my mistakes in shadow-play: the snapped word, the missed opportunity, the task left undone.

Then I stumble, as if caught by the memory of a mistake that usually devours me with guilt. But here, instead of that familiar collapse inside myself, I am surprised by an overwhelming gentleness. A golden warmth begins to bloom in my chest, as if a tiny sun is rising inside me, melting the cold hardness around my regrets.

I look at my own hands, trembling, so often curled into fists of frustration. Now they uncurl, soft and open. I feel all the disappointment, but instead of recoiling from it, I wrap my own arms around myself, feeling my heartbeat steady under the embrace. Whispering voices now murmur new words—soft, clear, forgiving.

The labyrinth walls dissolve, transformed into a garden wild with impossible flowers: cerulean petals, obsidian roses, fiery marigolds reflecting every color of memory. The air tastes like honey and fresh rain. I sink into a patch of moss, reclining as a gentle breeze tousles my hair, my errors now seeds sown into fertile soil.

Above me, the clouds part, and beams of shimmering starlight descend, each one illuminating a different chapter of my life—not just the triumphs, but the missteps too—and I see how necessary each has been. The lines on my palms shimmer with possibility.

Breathing deeply, I realize: I am allowed to be flawed. I am allowed to grow. Self-compassion courses through me—liquid silver, golden syrup, stardust. For the first time, I cradle my mistakes as I would a frightened child. And in this dream, I smile, wholly, truly, with a peace that lingers long after I awaken.
