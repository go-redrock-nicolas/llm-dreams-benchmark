I am dreaming. … drift inward, deeper than REM and deeper still, until the dream’s membrane peels away and deposits you in a place that looks like it was painted by a comet in love with a cathedral.

You stand on a bridge of polished moon-glass suspended over an ocean of slow-moving ink. Above you, constellations flicker like bioluminescent chimes, rearranging themselves whenever you blink. Each star spells a possibility, and right now they’re spelling disaster.  

The worst-case scenes bloom around you like poisonous flowers:

• On your left, a wave the color of mercury rises higher than any skyscraper, carrying splintered fragments of everything you’ve ever built.  
• On your right, an avalanche of calendars tumbles from a sheer cliff, pages ripping free and shrieking tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow in a choir of panic.  
• Directly ahead, a carnival mirror shows you frozen onstage, words drying up, while the crowd melts into shadowy smirks.  

These are your catastrophic projections—mind-made phantoms wearing the costumes of certainty.

You feel your pulse drum against your ribs, echoing like war drums on the glass bridge. The bridge begins to crack, spider-webbing beneath your feet, mirroring the anxious fissures in your thoughts.

Addressing the surge of dread, you remember—this is a dream, therefore a laboratory for alchemy.

1. You inhale. Air here tastes of silver sap and night jasmine. You count the inhale to five, hold, then release to seven. With each breath the mercury wave slows, thickens, loses height. Soon it resembles a curved mirror rather than a monster tide.

2. You extend your hands. Luminous golden thread unspools from your fingertips—pure intention crystallized. You weave it through the cracks in the bridge. Glass knits back together, stronger, now veined with warm topaz light like sunrise trapped in crystal.

3. You turn to the avalanche of calendars. With a flick of your wrist, the pages freeze mid-air. You whisper, “Context,” and the pages reverse direction, flying back onto the cliff face while their numbers rearrange themselves into mosaics that spell Maybe and Choice instead of Tomorrow. The choir softens to a lullaby.

4. Facing the carnival mirror, you step toward it rather than away. Your reflection looks terrified, but you reach out and press your palm to the cold surface. The glass ripples, and a second you—steadier, smiling slightly—steps through, merging with your form. Words bloom in your chest: Prepared, Capable, Curious.

With the dream-scape quieted, a door materializes at the edge of the bridge—an archway woven of willow branches, fireflies orbiting its frame. You pass through and arrive in a circular library lit by floating lanterns. Every book on every shelf contains a narrative of what might happen in the upcoming challenge: triumphs, lessons, plot twists, mundane outcomes. A gentle librarian—an ageless being with galaxies for pupils—greets you.

“Catastrophe,” they say, tapping a tome bound in thorny leather, “is merely one genre among many. Read widely.”

You open a slim volume titled The Subtle Victory and skim chapters filled with small, satisfying successes: a crucial question asked at the perfect moment, a single sentence that changes a skeptic’s mind, a laugh that dissolves tension. The scenes feel feasible—achievable, even.

You realize the dream has handed you power: the authority to curate which mental stories receive spotlight and which are relegated to the archives. The librarian hands you a quill of starlight. You write a fresh outcome on a blank page: You step into the challenge alert, grounded, playful; you adapt mid-stream; you leave with new allies and a deeper well of confidence.

The ink dries with a quiet thunderclap. Shelves rearrange so that your newly scripted possibility sits eye-level, glowing faintly.

Feeling lighter, you exit the library. The bridge, the wave, the cliff—they have reorganized into a tranquil seascape under dawn. The sun breaches the horizon, unhurried. Its light sheathes you in warmth.

As you prepare to wake, you gather three keepsakes from the dream:

• One shard of the reforged bridge—reminds you resilience can be engineered.  
• One folded calendar page that now reads Enough—reminds you of present sufficiency.  
• One quill of starlight—reminds you authorship is yours.

You tuck them into the pockets of your subconscious, and the landscape dissolves into a gentle brightness.

The alarm clock will chirp soon, but when it does, you’ll rise carrying the quiet conviction that worst-case scenarios are only drafts, and you, dream-forged and deliberate, are the editor in chief.
