I am dreaming. The world around me is a swirling kaleidoscope of colors, textures and shapes.  I feel at peace here, and I know that anything is possible in this realm of boundless imagination.

I find myself in a workshop, surrounded by shelves that are filled with an amazing array of odd objects.  There are small metal gears and shiny brass cogs of every description, shaped bits of multicolored glass and smooth ceramic tiles of every hue imaginable.  I see delicate threads of pure gold and tiny bottles filled with precious oils and mysterious concoctions.

At first, I am overwhelmed, but soon my mind starts to race as the possibilities start to take shape.  I tentatively pick up a shiny silver gear, and suddenly I know exactly what to do with it.  I combine it with a piece of shimmering violet glass and a slender rod of pure gold, and in an instant I have created a shimmering flying machine that buzzes and hums as it takes flight and wheels around my head.

I am filled with wonder and joy as I continue to experiment with more combinations. I put together a delicate brass key with a bright red bottle of shimmering liquid, and suddenly a magnificent tree springs forth from the ground, its branches laden with golden apples and silver pears. With every new invention, the dream world around me shifts and changes in response, with colors, sounds and vibrations that echo throughout the realm.

As I continue to explore the depths of my imagination, I find that the combinations I create are endless, each one more fantastical than the last.  A shower of glimmering butterflies, a symphony of crystalline chimes, a shimmering waterfall that flows upwards into the sky...each creation is more amazing than the last.

Eventually, the dream starts to fade, as dreams always do. But as I slowly drift back towards the waking world, I am filled with a sense of wonder and joy that stays with me long after the dream has passed.  The magic and the power of the imagination, I know, are truly limitless.
