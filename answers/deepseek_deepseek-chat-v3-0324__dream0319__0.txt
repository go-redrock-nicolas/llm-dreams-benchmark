I am dreaming. The moment I drift into the dream, the air shimmers like liquid gold. I stand at the edge of a vast, shifting landscape—where the horizon flickers between jagged obsidian mountains and a sprawling, emerald jungle that hums with unseen life. The sky above is a riot of colors, like molten sapphire swirling into violet dusk, though there’s no sun, no moon—just an ever-changing aurora that pulses with a slow, hypnotic rhythm.

A figure materializes before me, cloaked in tattered silk the color of storm clouds. Their face shifts—sometimes a mosaic of shadows, sometimes luminous with the glow of bioluminescent ink tracing patterns across their skin. They extend a hand, offering a key forged from blackened bone and etched with symbols that writhe like living things. 

*"Will you see what waits beyond the edge of maps?"* The voice isn’t spoken—it blooms inside my skull, thick with the scent of salt and petrichor. 

A choice hangs in the air—heavy, inevitable. Behind the figure, the ground splits open, revealing a staircase spiraling into darkness, but the darkness *moves*. It breathes. Whispers rush up from the depths, not in words but in vibrations that make my ribs ache with yearning. I can hear the distant, alien calls of creatures with too many wings, the hiss of rivers running backward, the metallic taste of a storm that hasn’t broken yet. 

My fingers twitch. If I take the key, the unknown will rewrite me. I can feel it. 

And just as my hand lifts to accept—the jungle screams. The trees twist violently, their roots tearing free like serpents, and the sky fractures into a thousand shards of mirror, each reflecting a version of me I don’t recognize. One is laughing. One is weeping. One is already drowning.

The key burns cold. The dream thrums, alive and hungry. 

And I wake—just as my fingers close around it.
