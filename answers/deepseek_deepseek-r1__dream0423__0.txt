I am dreaming. I am now starting to become aware that something feels off in my relationship. The air between us feels thick with unspoken words, charged like the atmosphere before a summer storm. 

My partner's laughter rings out, but there’s a dissonance to it—a sharpness beneath the warmth, like a violin string tuned too tight. Their gaze lingers a moment too long when they think I’m not looking, eyes glinting with a flicker of calculation, as if measuring the weight of my reactions. Shadows stretch unnaturally in the periphery of my vision, curling like smoke around their gestures—a hand brushing mine becomes a vise, a casual suggestion twists into a whispered command.

When I try to voice my unease, the words dissolve on my tongue, tasting of ash and static. Their smile widens, impossibly, splitting into a crescent moon of polished bone. “Don’t you trust me?” they purr, the question slithering into my ears. Suddenly, the room warps—walls breathing, floorboards creaking with the echo of buried arguments. A clock above us ticks backwards, each *click* peeling away layers of time until I’m drowning in old wounds dressed as new apologies.

I reach for the doorknob—frostbitten iron beneath my palm—and in its reflection, I catch a glimpse of my own face shifting, reshaping itself to better mirror theirs. My heartbeat syncs to the reversed rhythm of the clock. Somewhere beneath the cacophony, a faint melody hums—my own voice, frayed but insistent, singing a lullaby I’d forgotten I knew. It rises, discordant and defiant, shattering the mirrors, splintering the scripted narrative.

The last thing I see before waking: a single petal from a black rose they once gave me, now writhing with bioluminescent veins, pulsing like a dying star’s final heartbeat.
As I stir in the half-light of the dream's aftermath, the lingering images pulse behind my eyelids like phantom lanterns. The room around me feels foreign yet familiar, the air viscous with the residue of the nightmare. My breath comes uneven, as though I’ve surfaced from drowning in syrup. The echoes of that twisted lullaby hum in my bones, a dissonant anthem that both terrifies and emboldens. 

I reach instinctively for the space beside me, finding only cold sheets—a stark contrast to the feverish heat of the dreamscape. Moonlight spills through the window, casting jagged shadows that writhe like the black rose’s venomous petals. My reflection in the darkened glass flickers, momentarily morphing into the malleable face from the dream, its edges blurred and wavering. 

A shudder courses through me as I replay the split-second before waking: the bioluminescent veins of the rose throbbing with a rhythm that mirrored my own panicked heartbeat, a grotesque symbiosis. Was it a warning? A plea? The line between manipulation and self-betrayal feels razor-thin now, blurred by the dream’s alchemy. 

Rising, I pad to the window, pressing my palm against the chill pane. The city outside pulses with indifferent life—car horns, distant laughter—a stark counterpoint to the suffocating intimacy of the dream. Yet even here, reality feels porous. A flicker of movement catches my eye: a shadow detaches itself from the alley below, melting into the shape of a figure with eyes that glint like polished onyx. They lift a hand in a salute—or a summons—before dissolving into the mist. 

The taste of ash still clings to my mouth. I whisper the forgotten lullaby, my voice cracking, but the melody feels different now—less a weapon, more a map. Somewhere between the shattered mirrors and the backwards-ticking clock, a truth coils, waiting to strike.
