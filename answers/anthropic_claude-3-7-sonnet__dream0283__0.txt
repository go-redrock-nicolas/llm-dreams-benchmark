I am dreaming. I find myself walking through a house that feels both familiar and strange. The walls shift subtly, breathing almost, as golden afternoon light streams through windows that weren't there moments before. I turn a corner and see someone I trust deeply—their face is clear to me yet somehow impossible to describe when I try to focus.

They smile, but something catches my eye on the table between us—an open journal with pages fluttering in an impossible indoor breeze. As I approach, words rise from the pages like smoke, forming sentences that reveal truth after truth they've concealed from me. Each revelation feels like glass breaking inside my chest.

The room darkens as I process what I'm seeing. The ceiling begins to drip with dark blue liquid that doesn't wet the floor. The person's smile never falters, though their eyes begin to reflect like mirrors, showing me memories of moments when they spoke untruths—about their past, about their feelings, about promises that mattered deeply.

I try to speak, but my voice emerges as scattered puzzle pieces falling from my lips. The walls begin to peel away, revealing not the outside world but endless corridors of paper archives containing everything they've ever hidden from me. 

My feet sink slightly into the floor as it becomes soft like wet sand. The betrayal doesn't arrive as anger but as a profound heaviness that makes the air thick. I reach out toward them, and my hand passes through their shoulder like mist.

"Why?" I ask, my voice finally returning but echoing strangely.

They begin to answer, but with each word they speak, they dissolve slightly, becoming less substantial. The truth is unmaking them, or perhaps unmaking my perception of them.

I'm falling backward now, though I haven't moved. The room stretches impossibly long as they recede into the distance, still speaking words I can no longer hear...
