I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful garden filled with flowers and trees and birds.  The air is fragrant and the sun is warm.
I notice that my emotions are more intense than usual.   I feel joyful and carefree as I walk among the flowers.  I also feel sad and lonely as I
realize that no one else is around to share this with me.
I decide to explore this curiosity by asking myself some questions:
Why am I so emotional today? 
What makes me happy?
What makes me angry?
What makes me scared?
How do I usually express my emotions?
