I am dreaming. …inhale a breath that tastes like sunrise and step forward onto a stage that isn’t really a stage at all, but a gently undulating disk of polished moon-stone floating in an ocean of whispering starlight. Above you, nebulae swirl like spilled watercolors; below, constellations coil and uncoil like living silver serpents. The audience—those fateful judges—waits in perfect stillness. Their seats are carved from facets of sleeping meteorites, and their robes ripple with galaxies, as though each garment holds a private universe.

You have practiced this skill a thousand waking hours and ten thousand dreaming ones: weaving music out of pure light. It begins with your hands. You lift them, and thin threads of radiance bloom from your fingertips—violet, indigo, and an impossible shade of dawn-green. They hum with the memory of distant suns. Each filament is alive, thrumming with stories you once whispered to yourself while rehearsing in quiet rooms, convinced no one could hear. Now, under the judges’ starlit scrutiny, those threads wait for your command.

First movement: you gather the violet strand, twisting it into a spiral that sounds like the hush before a storm. A low, resonant chord rolls across the cosmic amphitheater. Planets tremble in their distant orbits. A judge with eyes of molten gold nods imperceptibly.

Second movement: you tease the indigo, shaping it into a delicate lattice that chimes like rain striking crystal leaves. The lattice rises, drifts, and shatters into a million shimmering shards that reform as butterflies of cobalt light. They flit among the rows of judges, leaving comet tails in their wake. The audience exhales in collective awe—the sound is a soft, tidal hush.

Third movement: the dawn-green filament. This is the hardest, the one that always quivered in your grasp during practice, threatening to slip and unravel. You steady your breath. The filament quivers, sensing your hesitation, then straightens as you pour every memory of hope into it—laughter shared with forgotten friends, the tremor of first triumph, the ache of almost giving up but choosing to try again. The filament blooms into a great verdant tree, its trunk translucent, its leaves tiny prisms refracting hope itself. Each leaf rings a note of forgiveness for every mistake you’ve ever made.

A hush. The three structures—storm spiral, crystal rain-lattice, emerald prism-tree—rotate in perfect orbit around you, harmonizing into a single, breathtaking chord that stretches past sound and into feeling. It washes over the judges like warm dawn breaking on ancient worlds. You feel the vibration travel through your bones, into the moon-stone disk, and outward into the galaxy.

The final gesture: you bring your palms together. The spiral uncoils, the lattice collapses, the prism-tree sheds its leaves. All of it funnels back into your hands as a single sphere of blinding, opalescent brilliance. Your heart races; this is where you have faltered before, letting the sphere burst too soon, or dim too quickly. Not tonight. You center yourself, feeling your pulse echo the universe’s heartbeat, and release.

The sphere expands outward—silent, slow, and impossibly bright—until it envelops not just the stage, but the judges, the entire sky. In that instant, every eye in the amphitheater sees something different: a lost childhood dream, a forgotten love, a foretaste of triumph. When the light fades, nothing is broken, yet nothing is exactly the same.

Silence. Then the judges stand in unison, starlight dripping from their robes like liquid applause. The one with the molten-gold eyes steps forward, unfurls a scroll made of woven comets, and writes your name across it in letters of living flame. The scroll flutters shut, sealing your future as surely as dawn follows midnight.

Relief floods you, warm as sunlit honey. The disk of moon-stone steadies. The nebulae above part, revealing a sky more vivid than any you’ve seen awake. You bow, but instead of bending toward the judges, you arc toward the universe itself, grateful and astonished by the boundless theater of dreams.

And just before waking, you sense the lingering echo of your creation—the faintest chord of violet, indigo, and dawn-green—ringing somewhere behind your heartbeat, promising that, even in daylight, the dream still lives.
