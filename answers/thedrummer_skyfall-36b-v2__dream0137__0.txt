I am dreaming. You're transported to the deepest, most surreal depths of your subconscious.

The dream begins in a spacious, ornate courtroom, but everything has a twisted, distorted quality to it. The benches, the judge's gavel and chair, the witness stand - they all stretch and warp like molten wax. The walls are made of shimmering, amorphous glass that constantly shifts in color and opacity.

As you take your seat as the presiding judge, you realize your robes are woven from living vines that hiss and coil around you. Two grotesque, impossibly large gavel-shaped barracudas swim in an aquarium next to your bench, their eyes rolling and staring accusingly.

The defendants sit at the table before you - a marionette-like puppeteer with razor-sharp scissors for hands, a strangely elegant cockatrice with the body of a snake and the wings of a bat, and a cackling jester whose jingling bell laugh makes your skull sting.

As the trial begins and the macabre witnesses take the stand, the air grows thick and suffocating. Vines spill from the pulsing walls, clutching and hissing at the dge. The puppeteer's squints and the jester's practiced snarls betray a darker world.

The cocktail-bodied bat cockatrice attempts to seduce you as you hold the keys to their freedom. So you chip away at their defenses, determined to deliver justice.

Waves of pressure wash over you like radioactive rays, emanating from female circle-shapeds on which the words "forces" and "threats" are written in blood red. They orbit the courtroom, slowly accelerating, without colliding with the warping walls.

You feel the dream world tugging you, demanding to see your decision. As you raise the gavel to deliver it, the courtroom lurches, bending your vision, and suddenly you're plummeting through the distorted glass walls and into a chasm of writhing, hibernating desperation.
