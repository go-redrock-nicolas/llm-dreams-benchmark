I am dreaming. As I drift off to sleep one night, my mind begins to drift into a vivid and fantastical dream realm. In this dream, I discover a incredible power - the ability to create entire worlds simply by humming different melodies. 

At first, I tentatively try a few experimental tunes, unsure of what to expect. But as I begin to hum a simple, repetitive bar of notes, I watch in astonishment as a landscape starts to form around me. The ground beneath my feet transforms into a lush, emerald-green meadow, dotted with colorful wildflowers that sway gently in an unheard breeze. In the distance, rolling hills rise up towards a brilliant, azure sky, the fluffy clouds giving the illusion of a celestial cotton-candy backdrop to this pastoral scene. 

Emboldened by this discovery, I begin to hum more complex and varied melodies. For each new song I create, a totally unique and breathtaking world springs into existence. I find myself transported to a vast, desert landscape, with towering red sand dunes stretching out as far as the eye can see. Humansized cacti poke up from the dunes, their vibrant flowers a shock of bright yellow against the red. A visit from the trickster controller of this realm, Coyote, the native storyteller personifies this landscape.

With a different auditory composition, I step into an enchanted forest, where the trees have delicate gossamer leaves that shimmer like gold as they quiver in the wind. Tiny fairy-like creatures flit between the branches, their wings leaving trails of glitter in their wake. A nearby river burbles with silver waters, rajah lizards lounging on its banks.

No matter how strange or fantastical the melody, the places I create match the vision in my mind. There are tumbledown ghost towns in the wild west, steampunk cities of iron and brass, flowing cities in the far future, or like junglecities. Just a few bars of song is enough to birth an entire world.

I hum continuously as I roam the dream, taking in the wonders of each place. Happily, I become a little too confident and a strange, dissonant tune escapes my throat. The landscape warps and twists into a nightmarish swamp, the trees gnarled and leafless, their branches clawing at the sky. The air is thick and heavy, filled with the sound of buzzing insects and the croak of toads. I feel a shiver of unease as I realize this place is connected to my psyche, and may reflect some repressed fears or anxieties that I'd rather avoid confronting.

But as the dream continues, I learn to create balanced, harmonious melodies that reflect the beauty and joy I seek to express through my humming. I swim in crystalline lakes and drift through glittering galaxies. Perhaps the greatest thrill, however, is creating a world where an old friend waits by an unfamiliar door, ready to explore the next landscape together. Anywhere I wish I could go, I can.

I awaken wrenched back to reality, clutching the duvet as if it can possibly hold on to the marvels I have just experienced. And yet I know, with absolute certainty, that these worlds will be forever a part of me, and that I can return to them any time I wish to dream again.
