I am dreaming.

In this dream, I find myself beneath a sky the color of ancient sapphires, stretched wide and infinite above an ever-shifting sea of sand dunes. The very air vibrates with unfamiliar scents—spiced smoke, crushed desert herbs, the tang of distant rain. Around me, a circle of strangers moves in graceful synchronization, their layered robes stitched with iridescent threads that glimmer like dragonfly wings. Their faces are both solemn and curious, painted with swirling designs that shift subtly as firelight flickers across their skin.

I have been swept here, adopted by the Zahradi, a nomadic tribe whose culture is ancient as the stars, and whose customs are as intricate as fractal snowflakes. My old life seems as far away as the green lands beyond the horizon, dissolved like salt in wind. Here, among these people, everything must be learned anew, and nothing is taken for granted.

To be truly accepted—to be woven into their tapestry of existence—I must pass the Initiation of Roots, a ritual so old its origins are whispered only at midnight. It begins with the Gathering of Voices: I must listen in utter silence as the elders recount the story of the tribe’s wanderings, their losses and triumphs echoing around the encampment like distant thunder. Their language is fluid, a music of clicks, sighs, and lilting melodies impossible to imitate, yet somehow my heart understands.

Next, as dawn stains the dunes with molten gold, I am led by Amirah the Story-Keeper to the Song Circle. In this trial, I must dance my dreams into the sand, tracing forgotten loves and lost hopes with the soles of my feet as drummers mark the passage of time with rhythms that tilt the world. I stumble, sweat, and laugh, feeling ancient joy and trembling fear run side by side in my blood.

But the final test is the Weaving of the Starcloak. By the dying embers of the central fire, the tribe hands me slender reeds and silken fibers dyed with indigo and ochre. I must weave these into a cloak, each knot a memory—my own, and those shared in trust by the tribe. Finger by finger, strand by strand, I interlace my loneliness with their warmth, my wonder with their wisdom. Nights pass, scented with jasmine and woodsmoke, and nightmares dissolve into newfound belonging.

At last, when the cloak is finished, the youngest child drapes it over my shoulders, and the tribe erupts into jubilation—a burst of ululating voices, stamping feet, and rising smoke. Above, constellations wheel in celebration, and I feel—deep in the marrow of my bones—that I am home. I am Zahradi.
