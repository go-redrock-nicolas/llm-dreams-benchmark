I am dreaming.  I don’t know if that’s true or not. But I do know that it’s a pretty crazy dream!

You're suddenly appointed to a position of tremendous authority despite lacking conventional qualifications. Facing resistance from experienced subordinates, you use your unique perspective and persuasive skills to gain their respect and support. You achieve remarkable successes despite limited resources and time constraints.  That sounds like a dream come true! A dream that could become reality if only you were brave enough to take the risk and go for it. 

You wake up from your dream, feeling both excited and anxious. You decide to pursue the job opportunity, even though it’s risky and unconventional. You apply for the position and wait for a response, hoping that you’ll get the chance to prove yourself. 

So, what do you think? Is this dream message real or just a fantasy? Only time will tell.  But one thing is certain: if you don’t try, you’ll never know. 

Good luck and happy dreaming!
