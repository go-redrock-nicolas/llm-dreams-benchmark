I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a grand, dimly lit cathedral, the vaulted ceiling reaching up towards the heavens like a majestic work of art. The air is heavy with the scent of old wood and the soft hush of whispers. It's a funeral procession, and the mood is somber, expectant. The mourners, clad in black, are seated, their faces solemn and rapt. The coffin, draped in somber drapery, is positioned at the front of the church, its presence a poignant reminder of the beloved soul that lies within.

As the priest begins his eulogy, I feel a flutter in my chest, a tickle in the back of my throat. At first, it's a faint, almost imperceptible sensation, but it grows, spreading through my body like a warm, ticklish breeze on a summer day. My eyes scan the crowd, and I see the faces of the mourners, their eyes welling up with tears, their faces etched with sorrow. And I'm trying my best to maintain a stoic expression, to respect the occasion.

But then, out of nowhere, a giggle begins to well up in my throat. It starts as a tiny, sorry-sounding snicker, but quickly escalates into a full-blown, uncontrollable guffaw. My belly begins to shake, my ribs ache, and my face contorts into a comical grimace. I try to stifle it, but it's no use – I'm bursting to let it out. The sound of my own laughter is like a rolling thunderclap, crashing through the hushed silence, shattering the somber atmosphere.

The crowd's faces turn towards me in horror, their eyes wide with shock and amusement. Some of them gasp in dismay, while others try to stifle their own grins, their lips twitching upwards in suppressed laughter. The mourners' whispers transform into snickers, and the priest's speech is abandoned as he gazes at me with a mixture of confusion and exasperation.

I'm mortified, but still, I'm aching to release the pent-up mirth. It's like my body is a dam about to burst, and I'm powerless to stop it. My shoulders quiver, my knees wobble, and my laughter becomes a full-blown hyena-cackle, echoing through the cathedral's hallowed halls.

The mourners, now openly laughing, begin to giggle, then chuckle, and eventually, full-blown guffaws erupt from their very souls. The somber atmosphere shatters into a kaleidoscope of jests, the coffin seems to fade into the background, and the funeral service descends into chaos.

In the midst of this wondrous mayhem, I realize that, incredibly, I'm still trying to secretly suppress my laughter, careful not to let it take over completely – I don't want to be the sole source of comedy, even in this shared moment of absurdity. My fellow mourners, shocked to tears, continue to laugh uncontrollably, their faces flushed, their eyes shining with merriment.

And in the midst of this absurd, rushed, smooth paste of joking-triumph, a cackling silence, now blurred along glossy edge walls becomes one lingering intoxication as memories.
