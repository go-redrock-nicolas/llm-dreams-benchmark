I am dreaming. I'm walking through a vast, empty mall. The lights are off, casting long, eerie shadows that dance and sway like ghosts in the dimness. The air is heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and forgotten perfume, a ghostly reminder of the vibrant life that once filled these halls.

A feeling of profound lack gnaws at me, a hunger that has nothing to do with food. It's a scarcity of connection, a desperate need for companionship in this echoing solitude. Yet, as I wander through the desolate corridors, I notice something peculiar. The storefronts, though dark and seemingly deserted, are not empty.

Peering closer, I see that each window displays not merchandise, but scenes of warmth and togetherness. One window show's a family gathered around a crackling fireplace, their faces glowing with love and laughter. Another reveals friends sharing stories and dreams under a canopy of twinkling stars. A third portrays a couple, hand in hand, walking along a moonlit beach, their silhouettes etched against the shimmering water.

These images, vibrant and full of life, stand in stark contrast to the emptiness I feel. They are objective evidence, clear reflections of the connections I yearn for, yet perceive as absent. It's as if I'm looking through a distorted lens, one that filters out the abundance surrounding me, leaving only the perception of lack.

Why this disconnect? Why does my heart ache with loneliness when surrounded by proof of love and belonging? The dream offers no easy answers, only the unsettling realization that my perception might be the true source of my scarcity. The mall, this vast, empty space, becomes a metaphor for my own internal landscape, a place where perceived lack overshadows objective abundance.

As I continue my solitary walk, the images in the windows flicker, beckoning me to challenge my perspective. They whisper of possibilities, of connections waiting to be acknowledged, if only I could adjust my lens and see beyond the shadows of my own making. The dream leaves me suspended in this paradox, caught between the chilling reality of my perceived scarcity and the tantalizing promise of abundance, just beyond the glass.
