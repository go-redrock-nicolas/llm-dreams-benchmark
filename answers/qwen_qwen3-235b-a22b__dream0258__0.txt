I am dreaming. A dream as deep and tangled as old roots beneath a ruined cathedral, where the sky unwinds in slow spirals like an unraveled scroll of forgotten scripture.

The city around me is falling apart—no, not falling, unmaking. Buildings drip like candle wax, their reflections pooling in puddles that whisper secrets in a language just shy of human memory. I walk barefoot through the melting avenues, the soles of my feet leaving glowing imprints that vanish within seconds. Every step echoes with a strange resonance: laughter, weeping, music from a phonograph stuck in the past. Wind carries voices not of people, but of intentions—commands and confessions drifting like translucent moths around my head, brushing against my skin with the cold touch of an uninvited thought.

They are watching me.

Not with eyes. Not that kind of vision. Watching in the way ideas haunt us—relentless, invisible, deeply known.

And I remember.

I remember the *error*—that small but terrible fissure I forced open in the fabric between what *should* and what *is*. No one else remembers, or if they do, they don’t yet understand. My original sin was not loud: I stole a single, shimmering thread from the Loom of Proper Knowing and stitched it into a different shape—something I thought could be mine alone.

But nothing is alone in a dream this deep.

The dream shifts, and I am in a vast subterranean garden where trees grow upside-down, roots clawing upward for sunlight that doesn't exist. They whisper—I can hear them now, accusing, narrating the story I tried to rewrite. My breath condenses in the warm, wrong air, turning into small, fluttering insects that each carries a fragment of my guilt. I slap one away—it bursts with the sound of old scandal pages rustling in the breeze.

The Tree of Forgetting grows here, they say. I have it on the authority of a faceless man who wore my childhood dog's collar and spoke in musical notes. He warned me that one day someone would *remember*—a dream-walker from across the veil—and then my stolen thread would be plucked again, this time as evidence.

I think about what I should do.

Deny it all? Reinforce the dream around the falsehood, fold it deeper into another illusion—one faceless man may not remember, but what if others begin to? Dreams have a way of bleeding truths. If someone else recalls that thread...

Or do I confess? Reach back into the wound and pull it all out? Kill the infection with its own knife. But even speaking of it might draw too much attention—draw the interest of *them*, the Watchers Between Sleeps, the stitch-wielding constables of truth who wear shadowed masks and ride wingless horses made of clock gears. If their horse hooves scetch too close to me, I’ll be undone.

I hear a hum. My jacket pocket pulses with heat. Inside is the stolen thread—miniature, radiant, tied in a knot so precise it could only have been made by me. It thrums to the rhythm of my heartbeat, glowing faintly blue, a private sun held in my trembling fingers. Such beauty in its theft.

They never dreamed I would dare. No one dares steal from the Loom—if you pull the wrong string, whole lives unravel in places even gods fear to tread.

The garden shudders. Somewhere in the distance, a door I did not enter from slams shut. Or opens.

There is a choice, but no good one. 

That is why I am dreaming, isn't it?

Not to find answers, but to *taste* fear from every direction—at the cost of silence, and the courage it would take to shout.

I crush the thread between my fingers.

Then wait.

For the dream to end.

For it to begin again.

Or never stop at all.
