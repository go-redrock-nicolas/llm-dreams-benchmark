I am dreaming. I'm exploring ancient catacombs when my only light source begins to flicker unpredictably.  As the darkness grows more complete and disorienting with each failure, I feel a sense of panic rising within me.   I wonder if this is how it feels to be blind or lost at sea.    Will I ever see again?   Will I ever find my way out of here?

Suddenly, I hear a sound behind me.  A low growl that sends chills down my spine.  I turn around and see a shadowy figure emerging from the darkness.  It's huge and menacing, with glowing red eyes and sharp claws.  It's coming for me.

I run as fast as I can, but it follows closely behind me.  I trip over a stone and fall to the ground.  I look back and see its shadow looming over me.  It's about to pounce on me when something unexpected happens:

A bright light shines from above, illuminating the entire cave.  I squint my eyes and see that it's coming from an opening at the top of the tunnel.  A hole in the roof through which sunlight can enter.

The shadowy figure stops in its tracks and retreats back into the darkness.  It seems afraid of the light.
