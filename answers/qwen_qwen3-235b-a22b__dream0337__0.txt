I am dreaming. (*••*)

The air is thick with the scent of something I cannot name—neither flower nor spice, but a scent spun from memory and myth. I open my eyes and find myself standing at the edge of a vast city built atop the back of a slumbering beast. The skyline is curved, following the great arc of its ribs, and its breath rises like fog from chimneys carved between its scales. Towers shimmer with iridescent glass, and bridges made of light span between buildings that grow and shift like coral responding to some unseen current.

I do not remember arriving here. There was only a blink, and then this place—beautiful, impossible—just *was*. I try to speak, but the words that leave my mouth are not my own, and no sound follows. I realize I am mute, or perhaps this world mutes all spoken language. Above me, three moons share a sky the color of soaked parchment, each casting a different kind of light—amber, indigo, and silver.

Everything is quiet, not in the way silence crushes, but in the way a held note hums between beats. 

I walk barefoot along streets paved with soft blue tiles, warm beneath my feet. Around me, the inhabitants drift rather than stride, their robes stitched with glowing glyphs that pulse like heartbeats. No one speaks aloud. Instead, they gesture with elaborate grace—hands painting meaning into the air, eyes reflecting entire conversations. A merchant brushes fingertips to his wrist and extends it toward me, offering a fruit that shimmers with edible light. I bow slightly and press my palm to my chest in return. A thank you, unquestionably understood.

This is a world without spoken language. Here, they converse through rhythm, touch, scent, and movement. Around a communal well, children dance out poetry while elders sketch history in the air with swirls of smoke. The city pulses with a rhythm of soundless song—music made visible, emotions transformed into art.

As I walk deeper into this living dream, I understand that words would only disrupt the harmony. Here, communication is more direct, more *intimate*—spoken language stripped away like a veil, leaving meaning bare and beautiful. Emotion radiates from people like heat. I feel anger as a flicker of red energy, and joy as a physical glow at the edges of their bodies.

At the heart of the city stands a tree grown upside-down—roots curling into the sky, searching for stars. Its leaves hum in harmonic tones. A tall woman with a cloak of tiny stars invites me to touch the bark. When I do, I remember forgotten dreams—scenes from my childhood, faces that vanished long ago, lullabies sung to me in voices I did not realize I remembered.

As the moons begin to align, the sky darkens into velvet.

Rising from beneath the city comes a long, resonant tone, as if the sleeping beast underfoot has stirred. The air vibrates not with words, but with understanding: a message that the time has come.

To what, I do not know.

But I am not afraid.

I close my eyes—

—and when I open them again, I wake. The scent of the city lingers on my tongue like the end of a wish. I reach for words to capture what I saw. But some dreams are too vast, too alive, to be caged in language. This one, I must keep locked in the chambers of my chest—a secret world, folded and waiting, ready to return in sleep.
