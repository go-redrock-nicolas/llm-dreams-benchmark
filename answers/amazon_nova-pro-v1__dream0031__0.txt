I am dreaming. I'm on a crowded subway, the metallic hum of the train vibrating through the seats as it hurtles through the underground labyrinth. The air is thick with the scent of old metal and the faint tang of sweat from the myriad of passengers. The fluorescent lights flicker above, casting a sterile glow on the sea of faces—some engrossed in their phones, others lost in the rhythm of the train's movement.

Suddenly, the world lurches to a halt. The train shudders and groans, coming to an abrupt stop between stations. The lights flicker once, twice, and then plunge the entire carriage into a suffocating darkness. A collective gasp ripples through the crowd, followed by a murmur of confusion and growing panic.

In the pitch-black, the sounds become amplified—the frantic tapping of fingers on smartphone screens, the nervous whispers, the distant drip of water echoing from the tunnel walls. The air grows heavier, thick with an electric tension that makes every breath feel labored.

Then, from the darkness, a soft, ethereal glow begins to emanate. It starts as a faint, ghostly light, barely visible at first, but it grows stronger and more defined. The glow coalesces into swirling patterns of color—vibrant blues, shimmering greens, and radiant purples—forming an otherworldly aura that dances and pulses with life.

The panic begins to wane as the passengers are drawn into the mesmerizing light. It feels as though the very air is charged with magic, and the darkness is no longer threatening but rather a canvas for this surreal spectacle. 

As the light grows brighter, the subway car transforms. The walls dissolve into a living tapestry of stars and nebulae, the seats morphing into plush clouds. The floor beneath my feet becomes a shimmering river of liquid light, guiding me forward.

I find myself walking through this dreamscape, the other passengers now silent and awestruck, following the river of light. We move through a tunnel of stars, the cosmos unfolding around us in a breathtaking display of celestial beauty. 

Ahead, a grand portal beckons—a swirling vortex of colors and light, promising an adventure beyond the mundane. As I step closer, I feel a sense of exhilaration and wonder, knowing that this dream is taking me to a place where anything is possible, where the boundaries of reality blur and the imagination reigns supreme.

And then, as I step through the portal, the dream shifts once more, carrying me to new, uncharted realms of wonder and magic.
