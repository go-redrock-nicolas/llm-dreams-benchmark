I am dreaming.   I open my eyes to find myself in a world of swirling colors and indescribable vibrancy. The air itself is thick, like a soft cotton candy that brushes against my skin as I walk. Above me, the sky is a kaleidoscope of swirling oranges, purples, and greens, like an eternal sunset that never fully dips below the horizon. The ground beneath my feet feels alive, pulsating gently with every step I take. It is as though the earth itself is breathing, a rhythm that syncs with the beats of my heart. I can’t help but feel as though I am a part of this vast organism, a single cell floating in an ocean of consciousness.   As I walk, I become acutely aware of the lights—delicate shimmers that dart through the air like impossibly agile fireflies, leaving trails of golden luminescence behind them. I reach out to touch one, and as my fingers graze its glow, I feel an odd sensation—a gentle pull, almost as though I am being tugged toward something greater. I follow the path of the golden sparkles, where I find myself in a grove surrounded by a ring of massive, glowing mushrooms. Each one stands taller than me, their caps emitting a soft, violet light that pulses in and out like a heartbeat.   It is here, in the center of this impossible circle, that I sense something larger. The lights gather around me, and I realize they are not just fireflies but tiny, glowing figures with tiny, soft voices. They speak in a language I cannot understand, but somehow, I know what they are saying. They speak of connection, of unity, of becoming one with something far greater than myself. "Join us," they seem to whisper, their voices blending with the hum of the mushrooms and the rhythmic pulse of the ground.   But as their light caresses me, I feel something shift inside me—an awareness of the diminishing space between my own thoughts. The more I stand here, the more I feel myself slipping into a vast, collective consciousness. It is both exhilarating and terrifying. "I want to be myself," I say aloud, or at least I think I say it. The air takes my words and cushions them like a ball bouncing gently on a blanket, and for a moment, I hear them echo back as though the dream itself is speaking. 
The lights seem to pause for a moment as if considering my words. The mushrooms' glow grows brighter, their light pulsating faster now, urging me for an answer. "Join us," they chant again, this time louder, more insistent. The pull grows stronger, like the undertow of a great wave. My heart pounds in my chest as I realize that I can feel their presence not only around me but inside me. My breath hitches—I taste honey and metal, like the first sip of berries that ripen too quickly, sweet yet sharp. I blink, trying to focus. 
Something inside me stirs, a flicker of defiance. "I am more than this," I say, louder now. I raise a hand, glowing faintly from the shimmer of one of the lights, and I make a small gesture—just a flick of the wrist—but with it, I feel power ripple through me. 
The mushrooms falter for a moment, their lights dimming. The small glowing figures freeze in place, their voices silenced. My heart races. I realize now that I can feel the dream’s pulse not as a passive participant, but as an active force. I have the ability to bend it to my will.   With a newfound confidence, I push back against the collective consciousness. I imagine a shield around myself, a radiant golden aura that protects my sense of self, my individuality. The lights recoil, the mushrooms seem to tremble, their glow softening to a more gentle violet once more. "I am myself," I repeat, and this time, it feels like a declaration.   The lights waver, uncertain. The mushrooms return to their soft rhythm, as though conceding to my will. For the first time, I notice the dream’s horizon opening up- a road of glittering sand appears before me, winding toward the impossible unknown. It is a path entirely of my making. The air settles, and I know, deep within me, that I am free—not just of the dream’s pull but of all that seeks to bind me to anything other than my true self.   With a last look at the glowing circle, I begin to walk forward, leaving the grove behind. The lights twinkle faintly in my wake, a quiet reminder that I can choose to be a part of something greater without losing myself within it. As I walk, the dream’s landscape shimmers around me, the colors blending and bending in my wake, as though the world itself is reshaping to fit my steps.   I wake up with that lingering sense of freedom and control, the taste of wild berries still on my tongue, and a faint glow of pride in knowing that, even in the realm of dreams, I am unyieldingly myself.
