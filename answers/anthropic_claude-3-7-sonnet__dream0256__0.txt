I am dreaming. The rain falls in silver sheets around me, drumming against the pavement with hypnotic intensity. The city lights blur and refract through the downpour, creating halos of amber and blue that seem to breathe with each gust of wind. The streets have emptied of the usual crowds, everyone rushing for shelter, hunched figures darting between awnings and doorways.

Except for one figure who moves against the tide. 

I notice him as he approaches—a man with weathered skin and eyes that hold a universe of stories. His clothes hang heavy with rain, and his shoes are split at the seams. He carries everything he owns in a plastic bag that's turning translucent from the water. The rain has plastered his gray-streaked hair to his forehead, yet there's a dignity in how he holds himself.

"Excuse me," he says, his voice barely audible above the storm. "I hate to ask, but I've nowhere dry tonight." His hands are red with cold, trembling slightly, but his gaze is steady and direct.

Around us, the few remaining pedestrians quicken their pace, eyes averted, creating a bubble of isolation around this man as if his misfortune might be contagious. Their indifference feels physical—a wall of invisible backs turning away.

Something stirs within me—perhaps that ancient recognition of our shared humanity that transcends all circumstantial differences. In this dream-state, I feel an unusual clarity, as if seeing through the superficial layers of social conditioning to something more fundamental.

I reach out my hand toward his, not with coins but in greeting, and invite him to share the shelter of my umbrella. In this suspended moment between raindrops, I see a flash of surprise cross his face, followed by something rarer—trust cautiously reawakening.

Together we walk toward a café glowing warmly on the corner, a lighthouse in the storm, where steam rises from cups and conversations, promising temporary refuge from more than just the rain.
