I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of wet stone and something faintly metallic, like old coins left in the rain. The world around me hums with an eerie resonance, as if every surface is vibrating just beyond the range of hearing. I stand in a vast hall, its ceiling lost in shadow, its walls lined with shifting mirrors—each reflecting not just faces, but desires, fears, the hidden fractures in a person’s soul.  

And then, I *understand*.  

It’s effortless.  

The man before me—tall, broad-shouldered, exuding confidence—flinches when I tilt my head and whisper, *"You’re still that boy they called weak, aren’t you?"* His jaw tightens. His eyes flicker with something raw, unguarded. A crack in the façade. And just like that, he bends. His will crumples like paper, and his strength becomes mine to wield.  

Down the hall, a woman laughs with practiced charm, her voice velvety and assured. She doesn’t see me watching, doesn’t notice the way her fingers tremble around her wineglass when her lover glances away. *"She’ll leave you,"* I murmur, brushing past her, my words sinking beneath her skin like toxins. Her smile falters. Doubt floods her, sudden and drowning, and I feel the sharp, intoxicating thrill of pulling her strings.  

The deeper I walk, the more the air shimmers with possibility. The hungry artist, desperate for validation? A single dismissive glance sends him spiraling. The politician, bloated with pride? A well-placed rumor, a seed of insecurity, and he grovels at my feet. Every person is a lock, and I—I hold the key.  

For a moment, exhilaration swells in my chest. I am a god here, bending reality through the frailties of others. But then—  

A whisper of movement in the dark.  

One mirror remains unbroken. It does not reflect the others. Instead, it shows only me. My own reflection stares back, but my face is crumbling—ashy, hollow, as if something is rotting from within. I reach up, touching the glass, and my fingers come back wet with something black and thick.  

And in the silence, a soft voice, colder than winter, murmurs:  

*"What happens when someone finds yours?"*  

The dream shivers—then collapses—and I wake gasping, my hands clenched tight, the taste of power and ruin still thick on my tongue.
