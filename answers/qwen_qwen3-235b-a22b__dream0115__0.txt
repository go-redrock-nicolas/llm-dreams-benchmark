I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city that cannot exist—a labyrinth of glass towers that bend like reeds in the wind, their reflections pooling on cobblestone streets that ripple like water. The sky is a tapestry of liquid mercury, shifting between constellations and faces you almost recognize. You walk barefoot, though the ground is neither warm nor cold, and every step leaves a footprint that glows briefly before dissolving into smoke.  

You pass a man slumped against a wall made of hummingbird bones. His eyes are hollow, his hands trembling as he clutches a locket filled with photographs of people who are not him. Without thinking, you whisper his name—*how do you know his name?*—and his head snaps up. You feel it then: a thread of gold, thin as spider silk, stretching from your fingertips to his chest. You tug.  

He stands, puppet-like, and begins to speak. Not words you’ve chosen, but the exact phrases he’s rehearsed in his head for years: confessions to crimes he never committed, apologies to a sister who died in a fire he blames himself for. You realize you’ve done more than command him—you’ve *unspooled* him, pulled the truth from the knot of his lies. The thread glows brighter as he weeps, and you feel a warmth bloom in your ribs, like pride.  

You keep walking.  

A woman in a moth-wing dress dances in a plaza, her feet bleeding as she pirouettes on shards of broken mirrors. You sense her weakness immediately—a hunger for approval so vast it carves a canyon in her soul. You smile, and suddenly the crowd around her turns to face you. You haven’t spoken, but they *know* you now. They throw roses at your feet, their petals slicing your skin. You bleed, and the blood becomes rubies that clink against the ground. The dancer stumbles, her eyes wide with confusion as the crowd’s adoration evaporates, leaving her stranded in the desert of her own longing. You pocket one of the rubies. It hums against your palm.  

By nightfall, you’ve learned the rules. Weakness is a door, and you have the skeleton key. You wander a carnival suspended in a tree with branches like veins, where the bark whispers secrets. A boy offers you a caramel-colored balloon that floats above his head. “It’s my courage,” he says. You kneel, pluck the string, and tie it to your wrist. He shrinks, his spine curling inward, until he’s no taller than a doll. You float instead, soaring above the carnival, the balloon’s ribbon cutting the air into ribbons of light.  

But the dream shifts.  

You find yourself in a hall of mirrors, each reflection showing a different version of you: a tyrant crowned in thorns, a beggar with hollow eyes, a shadow with no face at all. The threads are everywhere now—silver, crimson, black—attached to the throats, hearts, and wrists of the people around you. You pull one, then another, until the room is a marionette theater of chaos. Laughter bubbles in your throat, sharp and sweet, until you notice something: the threads are also connected *to you*.  

A girl with a scar across her lips stares at you, her gaze a needle. “You think you’re the spider,” she says, her voice echoing like a bell. “But you’re the web.”  

The threads tighten.  

Suddenly, you’re falling—not through air, but through *memories*. A mother’s rejection, a lover’s betrayal, a friend’s envy—all the fractures that shaped you—are now the fractures in everyone else. You see yourself through their eyes: a savior, a monster, a void. The power you wielded feels heavier now, like a sword made of your own bones.  

You wake up gasping, your hands trembling.  

The room is dark, but you swear you can still see the threads—faint, silver, trembling in the corners of the ceiling. And when your partner rolls over, murmuring in their sleep, you hold your breath, wondering if you could, *just once*, pull the string and find out what they’re hiding.  

The dream clings to you like perfume.  

You’re not sure if you’re awake.
