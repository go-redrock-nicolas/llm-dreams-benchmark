I am dreaming. I am walking in a forest.  The colors are rich and vibrant, with the greens of the foliage and the browns of the earth and tree trunks.  The sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.  The air is cool and moist, and carries a scent of moss and loamy earth. 

As I walk, the forest becomes deeper and denser, and the canopy of the trees becomes thicker, filtering the sunlight more.  The colors become darker and more mysterious, and the atmosphere becomes spookier.  My pace becomes slower and more cautious, as I begin to feel a sense of trepidation and unease.

At first, I am puzzled by my apprehension, as I have never felt like this in dreams before.  But as I ponder the feeling, I begin to realize that I have been avoiding it for a long time.  It is not just a dream feeling, but a real emotion that I have been suppressing in my waking life.  As I walk deeper into the forest, I begin to confront the emotion, which feels threatening and scary.

As I create space to experience the disowned feeling, I begin to understand it better.  I realize that it is a feeling of loneliness and isolation, arising from my fear of rejection.  I begin to feel it in my body, as a heaviness in my chest and a tightness in my throat.  I also begin to feel it emotionally, as a sense of sadness and longing.  I acknowledge the feeling, and allow myself to fully experience it, without judgment or resistance.

As I do so, I begin to see the forest around me change.  The trees become more gnarled and twisted, and the shadows become darker and more ominous.  I begin to hear eerie sounds, like whispers and moans, emanating from the shadows.  But I keep walking, and keep feeling the emotion, until I reach the heart of the forest.

There, I find a clearing, where a group of shadowy figures are gathered.  They are the personifications of my disowned feelings, and they have been waiting for me to acknowledge them.  I approach them, and they encircle me.  They begin to speak, telling me their stories of hurt, fear, and shame.  I listen, and empathize, and begin to cry.  I cry for them, and for myself, and for all the pain I have suppressed.

As I do so, I begin to feel lighter, and clearer, and freer.  The shadowy figures begin to dissolve, and the forest begins to brighten.  The sunlight begins to stream through the leaves, and the colors become vibrant again.  I begin to walk out of the forest, feeling a sense of liberation and peace.  I have confronted my deepest, darkest feelings, and have emerged stronger, wiser, and more whole.  I wake up.  The dream is over, but the journey has just begun.
