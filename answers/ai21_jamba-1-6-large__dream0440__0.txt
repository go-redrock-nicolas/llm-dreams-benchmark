I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, enchanted forest. The air feels alive, buzzing with hidden whispers, as though the very trees are speaking to each other. I step into the forest, and the ground beneath my feet is soft and cool, a carpet of moss that gently gives way with every step. The deeper I walk, the more vivid my surroundings become. Streams of crystalline water weave through the forest, glimmering in the dappled sunlight that filters through the dense canopy above. The air is thick with the scent of pine and something ancient, earthy, and grounding. I feel as though I am being guided, as though this forest is alive and knows me, as though it has been waiting for me.

Up ahead, I see a clearing, where the trees open up to reveal a small glade, bathed in golden light. The glade is alive with wildflowers of every hue—deep purples, vibrant oranges, and soft, delicate blues—dancing in a gentle breeze. In the center of the glade, there is a small, round pond, perfectly still, reflecting the sky above. I walk towards it, entranced, drawn to the shimmering water. As I reach the edge of the pond, I kneel down, my hands dipping into the cool water. It feels alive, almost electric, as though it’s awakening something deep within me.

Suddenly, the surface of the pond ripples, and an image forms, blurry at first but sharpening with every moment. I see myself as a child, playing in a sunlit garden. I can hear the laughter of my younger self, feel the innocence and joy that used to be so natural. But then, as if the image shifts, I see a darker moment. I see the look of disappointment on a loved one's face when I made a mistake, see the sting of rejection when I failed to meet expectations. These moments flicker through my mind like shadows across the water. Each one feels like a piece of me, a part of myself that I buried long ago.

And then, the image grows sharper, clearer. I see myself as I am now, Robb, standing at the edge of the pond, watching my past unfold before me. With each ripple, the reflection of the pond begins to change. I see the truths I want to rewrite now. I watch myself standing strong and unwavering, moving through life guided by courage and gentleness, rather than the need for recognition or validation. I feel the boundaries I long to set, firm and loving—breathing them into existence. I see myself letting go of old patterns, fears, and doubts that have lingered for far too long. The reflection of my present self shifts as I embrace my power, my worth, and my capacity to love and be loved without conditions.

The water begins to ripple once more, its surface returning to its calm state. But I feel different. As I look around, I can’t shake the sense that I’ve awakened something in me, something that had been waiting for me to acknowledge it. A soft breeze rustles through the trees, and with it comes a knowing, a deep certainty that this journey is only beginning. I stand, taking one last look at the water, which now reflects the golden sky above, the clouds swirling in patterns I’ve never seen before but somehow recognize. I turn and continue on the path, ready to face whatever comes next, knowing that the forest has more to show me.

The dream fades into something else entirely, but the glade remains with me, the whispers of the forest still in my ears. I know that I will carry this moment with me, like a talisman, as I move through the world awake, aware, and grounded in the knowledge of what I've carried and what I now choose to let go.
