I am dreaming. **The Dream of Endless Invention**  

You stand in your childhood bedroom, but the walls ripple like liquid mercury, and the air hums with static electricity. On the floor, ordinary objects float in defiance of gravity—a feather duster, a rusted bicycle bell, a box of crayons, a cracked teacup. Each item pulses with faint bioluminescent symbols, glyphs that twist like living vines. You realize you can *read* them. The crayons whisper *"chroma,"* the bell rings *"echo,"* the teacup steams *"vessel."*  

Your hands move autonomously, guided by dream logic. You pluck the bell and fuse it to the feather duster. Instantly, the duster vibrates, its feathers elongating into iridescent filaments that *sing*—a low, resonant note that scrubs dust from the air, leaving prismatic afterimages. A ***Sonic Broom***. You laugh, and the sound crystallizes into amber droplets that shatter into smaller laughs.  

Next, the crayons melt in your palms, pooling into a molten rainbow. You pour them into the cracked teacup, which seals itself with seams of starlight. When you sip, the liquid tastes like *possibility*—your vision fractures into a kaleidoscope of unseen colors. The room warps into a jungle of floating islands, each landmass shaped like a forgotten toy. A wind-up robot crab scuttles by, clicking out Morse code poems.  

A hunger ignites in you. You grab a kite string from the air and knot it to a slotted spoon. The spoon trembles, then rockets upward, dragging you into a sky stitched from quilted clouds. You’re holding a ***Cloud-Skimming Sieve***; it sifts sunlight into raw honey, which pools in your shoes. Bees made of stained glass emerge, stitching the holes in the atmosphere with threads of pollen.  

But the dream darkens at the edges. A broken clock fused with a keyblade becomes a ***ChronoLance***—stab it into the ground, and concentric ripples of time reveal your future self, aged 97, planting a seed that grows into a skyscraper-sized dandelion. You pluck it, but the seeds are tiny clocks that burrow into your skin, ticking.  

The inventions escalate, uncontrollable: a **Perpetual Origami Crane** (folded from a pizza box) that writes tragedies in midair with its shadow; a **Lullaby Lantern** (a mason jar full of fireflies and violin strings) that projects memories of strangers’ first kisses onto walls.  

Then—the room dissolves. You’re clutching a **Mirror Compass** (a makeup compact welded to a thimble), its needle spinning toward "Atlantis." Oceans rise in reverse, and you glimpse coral cities where citizens breathe ink and write with light. But the water roars like static, and the inventions begin to *unspool*—your Sonic Broom unravels into discordant shrieks, the Cloud-Skimming Sieve rusts midair.  

You wake gasping, fingertips still buzzing with phantom electricity. A single crayon rests on your pillow, glowing faintly. It smells of storm clouds and burnt sugar.  

The dream lingers.  
The inventions hum in your marrow.  
You wonder if the world is ready.
