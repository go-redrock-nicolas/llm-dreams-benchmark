I am dreaming. The world around me ripples like disturbed water as I stand face-to-face with Sarah, my closest friend since childhood. The living room where we're arguing keeps shifting - sometimes it's her apartment with the familiar jade plant in the window, other times it morphs into my grandmother's old Victorian parlor, though she passed years ago. The walls pulse with our emotions, literally changing colors from deep crimson to stormy blue.

Sarah's words seem to float in the air as visible ribbons of silver, but when I try to grab them, they dissolve like morning mist. We're fighting about... a key? No, it's deeper than that - it's about a promise we made under the ancient oak tree when we were twelve, but I can't quite remember what we swore to do.

As my frustration builds, gravity begins to falter. Books float off shelves, and Sarah's long dark hair starts to wave as if she's underwater. I try to step toward her, but my feet sink into the floorboards, which have become soft like warm caramel. The harder I struggle, the deeper I sink.

Suddenly, Sarah's face begins to shift - for a moment she looks exactly like she did when we were children, gap-toothed and freckled, then elderly with silver hair and laugh lines, then back to her present self. Each version speaks simultaneously, creating an ethereal chorus of accusations and hurt feelings.

I open my mouth to apologize, but instead of words, butterflies of brilliant azure and gold emerge, dancing between us. They carry fragments of memories on their wings - snapshots of all our shared moments, both joyful and painful. The butterflies swirl around us, creating a tornado of memories that lifts us both off our feet...

Just as I reach out to grasp Sarah's hand in reconciliation, the dream begins to unravel at its edges, like an old tapestry coming undone thread by thread, pulling us toward consciousness...
