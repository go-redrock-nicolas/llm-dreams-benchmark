I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, metallic thrum, like the vibration of a plucked string stretched across the sky. You stand in a sunlit marketplace, but the colors are too vivid—stalls blaze in neon hues, fruits glisten like polished gemstones, and the laughter of the crowd rings hollow, as if played from a staticky speaker. No one else seems to notice the **cracks**. They spiderweb across the cobblestones beneath your feet, glowing faintly violet, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. When you kneel to touch one, it hisses, and your fingertips come away smelling of burnt ozone.  

A child’s balloon drifts past, but instead of floating upward, it spirals *downward*, tugging its string into a sewer grate. Pigeons wheel overhead in a murmuration that spells jagged, shifting letters: **RUN. HIDE. NOW.** You blink, and the shapes dissolve into ordinary birds. Your chest tightens. Adrenaline floods your veins, sharp and sweet as ice wine. You want to scream, but your throat clamps shut—**mute**, as if the dream itself has gagged you.  

You stumble backward, knocking over a fruit cart. Apples roll toward the cracks, splitting open to spill black, tar-like pulp that hisses into smoke. Still, the crowd ignores you. A woman in a yellow dress steps over the mess, humming a lullaby that warps into a siren’s wail with each note. You claw at your arms, desperate to wake, but the dream clings like wet silk.  

Then you see **it**: a shadow pooling at the edge of the square, thicker than it should be, as though the world is bleeding ink. It crawls toward a playground where toddlers chase a red ball. You sprint, legs moving in slow motion, lungs burning. When you finally reach them, the ball bounces into the shadow—and *vanishes*. The children freeze, tilting their heads in unison, their eyes now voids like the spreading stain.  

You whirl to warn the crowd, but your voice emerges as a whisper: *“It’s under us. It’s hungry.”* No one hears. The sky darkens to bruised indigo, and the ground begins to **breathe**—rising and falling in slow, seismic sighs. A clock tower chimes, but each toll stretches into a discordant scream.  

The shadow surges.  

The last thing you feel is the earth opening beneath your feet, a maw of teeth made of roots and stone, as the dream whispers back: *“You saw too much. Now stay.”*  

You wake drenched in sweat, the taste of ash on your tongue—and the phantom hum of that metallic string still vibrating in your skull.
