I am dreaming. You stand on the rim of a vast, obsidian plateau that ripples like liquid glass beneath your feet. Above you, the sky is stained with bruised purples and molten gold—colors you’ve never seen but feel as heat on your skin. All around, the wind whispers in the language of half-remembered dreams: a susurrus of laughter, of weeping, of footsteps that vanish before you can follow them. Clenched in your hand is a small brass timepiece whose hands spin backwards, counting down the final sixty minutes before unimaginable ruin descends.

With every breath, you taste static—sharp, metallic tang—like the world is already rewiring itself. In the distance, a forest of glass trees trembles, each shard clinking as though struck by unseen hands. Their foliage fractures light into razor-bright petals that drift across the air like luminous ash. You call out warnings to the handful of sleeping villagers lounging beneath those crystalline boughs, but your voice falls into a soft void. When their hollow eyes open, they see only the pale blue of a clock face and shrug, returning to their lazy reverie as if you spoke in an alien tongue.

Thirty minutes remain. You anchor yourself against a ledge carved with runes that shift and re-form under your fingertips. The runes glow faintly—an eldritch pulse you can almost sense in your chest. Calmness seeps in, a steady heartbeat drumming against the rising terror. You exhale the static in your lungs and lift the timepiece to catch the dying light. Its hands tick past 29, 28, 27… each counted second is a blade pressed closer to your heart. Still you stand serene, as though you could will back the unraveling of this dream.

Twenty minutes. A distant crack like thunder – only it comes from all around, deep beneath the plateau. You glimpse fractures splitting the horizon: glowing fissures clawing upward, spilling molten memory. A wisp of smoke curls through the air, carrying the scent of scorched opal and burned silk. You close your eyes for a moment and remember something vital: the dream’s truth is woven from your confidence. If you falter, the collapse will rush in like a tidal wave of midnight. You straighten your shoulders, steadier than the wind itself.

Ten minutes. You feel the plateau begin to tilt, the glass beneath you sloping toward an abyss of swirling ink. Fear stirs, but you cradle it like a fragile bird—acknowledging its existence without allowing it to shatter you. In that moment of still resolve, the brass timepiece warms in your palm. Its back plate slides open of its own accord, revealing a miniature constellation: tiny, star-bright gears spinning in perfect synchronicity. They hum. You know what must follow.

One minute. An echo of your own voice—softer, more urgent—rises behind you. You turn to see your reflection, drifting just beyond the edge of the plateau, reaching out to you. Without hesitation, you step forward into the void, not to fall, but to meet the reflection halfway. The glass trees shatter like bells around you, the sky yawns its final crimson, and yet… you do not tremble. You clasp your mirror-self’s hand, and together you watch the last hand of the little clock sweep to zero. At that instant, the dream holds its breath—and within that silent beat, you realize that endings and beginnings are two sides of the same impossible coin.
