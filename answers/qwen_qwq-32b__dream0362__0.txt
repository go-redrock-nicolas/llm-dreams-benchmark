I am dreaming. I start to float upwards, moving through darkness. It's not cold or scary, just unknown. I pass through a blue light and suddenly am in a forest. The trees are all giant, maybe 100 feet tall with moss glowing faintly green. I feel a humming in the air. There’s a path made of starlight leading forward. I follow it. The trees grow closer together, the air more humid, until I reach a clearing. A waterfall pours into a pool of liquid light. In the center is a stone table with a crystal that pulses like a heart. The crystal speaks, telling me to touch it. I hesitate but do. An influx of visions: faces of people I’ve helped, moments where I made a difference, but also moments of selfishness and neglect. The crystal says, “Purpose is not found, it’s created.” I wake.
