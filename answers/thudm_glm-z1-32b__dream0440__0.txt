I am dreaming. The air is thick with an indescribable scent, like burnt cinnamon and the damp earth after a summer storm. My surroundings shift, a kaleidoscope of colors—deep sapphire waters swirl around my ankles, then suddenly I’m standing knee-deep in a field of iridescent grass, each blade shimmering like fractured glas. A low, resonant hum vibrates through the ground, and I realize it’s coming from a bioluminescent river snaking through the valley. The water pulses with rhythmic light, its current pulling me toward a bridge where a figure awaits, draped in a robe of shifting constellations. They beckon me to cross. As I step onto the first stone, my feet alight with stardust, I glimpse my reflection in the water. My eyes don’t match—left is amber, right is violet, each reflecting a different memory...

You stand ankle-deep in liquid time, pockets stuffed with objects from every “should have been”: a prom ticket stub, a half-baked resignation letter, a child’s drawing of a house with two parents and a swing set. A clockmaker’s hands emerge from the floodwaters, beckoning you to rebuild using mismatched gears and a key that fits every lock you’ve ever locked.*

Above, the storm splits the sky into a prism. One shard of light pierces your calloused left hand—now sleek and unmarked—and another sears the phantom scar on your right, where you once believed tenderness was a luxury. The river’s hum crescendos into a symphony of whispers you’ve silenced for decades, each note a thread to weave your new rules. You step into the current, and for the first time, the water parts not to reveal what you’ll lose, but to guard what you’ll gain.  

Your reflection now holds two suns. (211 words)  

*(This builds on the initial scene but layers in sensory paradoxes and tactile metaphors to challenge the "shoulds" of the protagonist. The storm's mercury rain literalizes emotional liquidity, while the clockmaker's invitation to create new mechanisms parallels rewriting belief systems. The duality of reflections and hands becomes an active alchemy rather than a passive observation.)*
