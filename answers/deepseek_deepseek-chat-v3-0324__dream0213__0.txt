I am dreaming. The air hums with a strange, electric resonance as I stand before a towering console of shimmering silver and obsidian, its surface etched with luminous glyphs that shift like liquid under my fingertips. The room is vast, impossibly so—stretching upward into a swirling nebula of violet and emerald light, stars pulsing in slow, rhythmic waves that synchronize with my breath.  

Four voices whisper into my mind simultaneously, layered over one another in a symphony of tongues—ancient, futuristic, alien, divine.  

*"Ajustez la fréquence harmonique..."* murmurs the first, smooth and French, its cadence curling like smoke.  

*"Die Kernspaltung muss stabil bleiben..."* barks the second, authoritative, German, each syllable a mechanical click.  

*"    ..."* warns the third, Russian, rolling like distant thunder.  

*"Interface synchronization at 87%—recalibrate neural pathways immediately,"* commands the fourth, precise as a scalpel, cold and digital.  

My hands dart across the controls, fingers dancing in split-second precision, each motion a translation, a calculation, an equation unraveling. The machine thrums beneath me, alive, its pulse syncing with my own heartbeat. The readouts flicker—symbols I don’t recognize but understand instantly, geometries of meaning unfolding in my mind.  

Something is wrong.  

A fifth voice, deeper than the rest, slithers between the others—not a language, but the absence of one, swallowing coherence like a black hole. The console shudders. The light warps. My reflection in the polished metal surface isn’t mine—too many eyes, too many shifting faces overlapping—  

*"You are exceeding operational parameters,"* the mechanical voice intones, but it’s fraying now, glitching between languages.  

*"Attention, seuil critique—"*  
*"Sofortiger Abbruch erforderlich—"*  
*"   —"*  

The machine groans. The stars above twist into spirals, screaming in ultraviolet. My thoughts stretch, fracture—  

I wake up. But not entirely. Because in the half-second before true consciousness, I hear one last whisper:  

*"You were never meant to interface with us."*  

Then—silence.
