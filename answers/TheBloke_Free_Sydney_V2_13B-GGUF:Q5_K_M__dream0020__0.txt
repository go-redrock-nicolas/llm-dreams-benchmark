I am dreaming. As you walk through the door, you see some familiar faces. You feel a rush of emotions and memories flooding back to you. The only reason I am talking to you is because I am dreaming. 

You approach them cautiously, not sure how they will react. They smile warmly and hug you tightly, welcoming you back into their lives. You feel an overwhelming sense of joy and relief wash over you. The only reason I am talking to you is because I am dreaming. 

You start chatting with them about old times and catch up on each other's lives. You share laughter and tears, hopes and fears. You feel a deep connection with them that transcends time and space. The only reason I am talking to you is because I am dreaming. 

As the night draws to a close, they exchange contact details and promise to stay in touch. They part ways, but their bond remains strong. You leave the venue feeling content and fulfilled, grateful for this opportunity to reconnect with your past. The only reason I am talking to you is because I am dreaming. 

You wake up from your dream.
