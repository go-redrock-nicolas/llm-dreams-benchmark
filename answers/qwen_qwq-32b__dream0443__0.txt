I am dreaming. The air hums with a kaleidoscope of colors, alive and shifting like auroras on another planet. I stand on a bridge woven from starlight, its railings made of liquid crystal that flows like molten sapphire. Below, a river of liquid time glows with the bioluminescent light of forgotten memories — each droplet a moment from past lives, swirling and whispering secrets.

A voice, neither male nor female, speaks without words. It says: *You resist the currents that could carry you forward.* The bridge trembles. Startled, I stumble, losing my balance. Before I can fall, a figure appears — my own reflection, but sharper, brighter, eyes alight with galaxies. Their mouth curls in a knowing smile.

They hold out a hand. "The waters below aren't threats," they say. "They're invitations." 

Reaching up, I take their hand. The bridge dissolve into constellations. The liquid time river pulls me in, not cold but warmth, each droplet a lesson learned and unlearned. I feel the weight of defensiveness melting, replaced by something porous and open — like sand dunes shifting under wind, reshaping without breaking.

When I surface, the sky is stained glass, fractured but whole. The figure is gone. In my hand rests a seed, pulsing with quiet light. Somewhere, a clockflowers blooms, marking the moment I chose to let the river in.\n
