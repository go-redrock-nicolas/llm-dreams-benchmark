I am dreaming.

The world around me is a cathedral of shifting glass, spires twisting into an ink-blue sky. My footsteps echo as I move down an infinitely long aisle lined with books that breathe in and out, their covers fluttering as if alive. My hands trail along their spines and instantly, each word I once understood blurs into unreadable glyphs—strange, sprawling marks that now mean nothing at all. The knowledge I wore like a second skin dissolves.

I pause, unmoored. Rootless. Around me, figures made of shimmering code—holograms of progress—whirl by, whispering secrets to one another in a language I cannot grasp. The tools I’d mastered crumble and fade at my feet. The ground is glassy, reflecting not my face, but a thousand possible versions of me: younger and older, lost and free.

Fear clutches me, but with it, an electric surge of something new. The walls of the cathedral flex, breathing in time with my pulse. Instead of shrinking, I reach into the shelves, and my hands sink through the books as if plunging into cool water. Stories swirl around my arms—unknowable, yes, but alive with possibility. I let go of my need for control, and the frustration dissolves.

With each step, my limbs morph—fingers lengthening into tendrils that feel out new patterns, eyes shifting to see not just words but the meaning behind meaning. I realize my worth was never just in what I knew, but in my capacity to wonder, to learn, to transform.

A doorway yawns open at the end of the aisle, bathed in radiant, color-shifting light. I step through, not as the expert I was, but as a changeling of curiosity. The rules are different here, but I greet them not with fear, but with a grin and a laugh. I am unmade—and reborn—as something infinitely more: a dreamer who thrives on reinvention, delighting in the poetry of the unknown.
