I am dreaming. The dream begins with me walking through a dense forest, the trees towering above me like skyscrapers. My heart races in anticipation of what lurks ahead. Suddenly, I hear rustling in the bushes and the sound of low growls that send shivers down my spine. As I start to run, my feet become tangled in a web of vines, and I fall to the ground. I try to free myself but the more I struggle, the deeper the vines entwine around me. 

Sweat pours down my face as I feel suffocated. Panic engulfs me and I start to have visions of failing an upcoming challenge. In my mind, I see myself standing in front of a classroom full of students, unable to answer their questions. The silence is deafening, and their pitying glances make me feel even worse. I wake up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding. 

Reluctantly, I open my eyes and see my phone alarm blaring. It's just a dream. I take a few deep breaths to calm down and remind myself that I have been preparing for this challenge for weeks. I trust myself and the knowledge I have gained. As I step out of bed, I envision myself confidently leading the class discussion, engaging the students with my passion for the subject matter. This time, my dream stays positive and I feel motivated to tackle the day ahead.
