I am dreaming. …and you must adapt before the sun climbs above the horizon or risk disappearing with the dawn.

I blink away cobwebs of sleep and stagger onto a street that feels achingly familiar yet impossibly altered, as though someone tilted the world and let all the colors drip into new shapes. The sky hums a bruised lavender, and every building wears a crystalline crust, like frost sculpted into cathedral lace. People—if you can still call them that—glide past on whisper-thin stilts, their feet never touching the ground. Where there should be morning chatter, there’s a hush so intense it presses on my eardrums; speaking is now a punishable offense. We once used words the way birds use wings, effortlessly. Overnight, language has become contraband.

I try to ask the nearest figure what happened, but the moment my lips part a crackling plume of black confetti erupts from my mouth. The crowd swivels, faces stretching longer, features melting in horror. A bell tolls somewhere deep in the city’s sternum—three resonant notes that sound like iron being torn. An enforcer appears: a silhouette stitched together from dusk and static, holding a lantern in which a single sentence blazes like a furious comet. I cannot read it; that, too, is forbidden. The enforcer’s gaze needles my skin with cold light. I swallow the rest of my words and bow my head.

Rule One: Silence is the new oxygen. Break it, and you suffocate on your own voice.

Needing to communicate, people use clouds of perfume—squeezed from tiny vials shaped like teardrops—to draw transient symbols in the air. Someone nearby sends me a swirl of heliotrope mist: It twists into the shape of two clasped hands, then dissolves. “Are you lost?” it seems to ask. I nod, forgetting nodding is illegal as well. A pulse of scarlet lightning scrawls across the sky like a reprimand. I force myself still and answer with a puff of citrus vapor I find in my pocket. The scent curls into a question mark. The helpful stranger wafts a reply of juniper and sea salt: Follow the river.

I turn toward a boulevard where water flows instead of asphalt. The current glides under bridges of paper and bone, studded with pearls of frozen laughter—souvenirs from a time when jokes were allowed. I step barefoot into the river; it’s warm, like steeped tea, carrying me silently past storefronts whose windows are filled with objects from yesterday’s normal. A telephone sits beneath a sign that reads, in scorching neon: RELIC, DO NOT TOUCH. Beside it, a grandmother’s lullaby is encapsulated in amber, the notes flickering like trapped fireflies.

Further along, I glimpse rebels hiding in the alleyway shadows. Their hair is woven with broken sentences, frayed clauses, half-remembered poems. Instead of mouths they possess tiny, luminous gardens blooming with fire-petaled flowers. If they wish to speak, they pluck a blossom and let its pollen shimmer into pictographs. One reaches out and presses a seed into my palm. Immediately, it sprouts into a crystal thorn, embedding itself beneath my skin. A whisper—voiceless yet unmistakable—thrums in my bloodstream: “Carry language forward.” I suddenly understand: I’ve been recruited.

Rule Two: Ideas must now travel undercover, smuggled inside gestures, scents, and heartbeat rhythms.

A map appears on the inside of my eyelids every time I blink—arterial lines of fluorescent coral leading toward a distant tower nicknamed The Echo. If I reach it before nightfall, I’m told, we might reboot the old rules or invent kinder ones. But the tower sits behind the Barrier of Forgotten Songs, and only those who remember the chorus of their childhood may pass.

My memory rummages through dusty attic boxes: the lullaby my mother hummed while painting stars on my ceiling. Hush now, wandering soul… I mouth it silently, let it vibrate only in my chest. The river answers with a surge of starlight, lifting me onto its back and racing toward the horizon.

Above, the lavender sky deepens to indigo stitched with silver scars. Each scar is a road not taken, a possibility outlawed by the new order. I promise them I’ll return with keys.

The dream trembles, edges dissolving like wet charcoal. Somewhere an alarm clock growls. But before waking, I carve one last vow in the soft wax of this reality:

Rule Three: Dreams are the final sanctuary—so dream loudly, even in silence.

And with that, the world folds into darkness, carrying me and my smuggled seed of language toward whatever dawn decides to be next.
