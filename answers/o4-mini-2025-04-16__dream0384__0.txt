I am dreaming. You are drifting beneath a sky that shimmers like liquid moonlight, each star a pulse of ancient memory. Cool mist curls at your ankles as you stand on the edge of a glass bridge stretched over an endless chasm. Below, shadows swirl in slow, seductive spirals—temptations of safety, familiar patterns that would cradle you in stagnation. You’ve spent too long perched on the lip of comfort, bypassing the very trials that beckon you toward growth.  

Your heart flutters with the ache of possibility. The bridge trembles under your weight—each tremor a whisper: “Stay where it’s easy.” Yet the deeper you breathe, the more the edges of fear sharpen into a promise. You lift one foot, and the glass arches like a sigh. With that single step, the chasm’s dark eddies pulse with startled wonder. You press forward, each footfall an echo of courage, and watch as the glass beneath you glows, lit from within by your resolve.  

Halfway across, the horizon fractures into prisms of color—salmon pinks bleeding into emerald greens and violet sparks. From the kaleidoscope emerges a tall figure woven of starlight and smoke, arms outstretched in invitation. Anxiety claws at your ribs, but you place a hand against the figure’s shifting form. Warmth floods you, and you feel your edges soften—discomfort transforming into clarity.  

Together you step through the prism and enter a forest where the trees hum with every decision you’ve ever shied from. Roots coil like questions around your ankles; branches arch like challenges overhead. You welcome the tightening coils, knowing they teach you your own strength. You reach up and touch a glowing blossom, and it unfurls, revealing blue fire at its heart. You cup its flame, and it dissolves your old fears.  

Now you walk on, each step a defiance of the safety you once craved. You awaken brand-new, every nerve alive with the rich pulse of growth, ready to meet the next dawning.
