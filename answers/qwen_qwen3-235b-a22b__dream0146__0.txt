I am dreaming. Or rather, I am *burning.*  

The world around me is unraveling, swallowed by a consuming fire that dances like a maddened god. The sky is no longer an expanse—it’s a caged lid of black, charred smoke, sizzling with ash and ember, glowing like a furnace that has finally swallowed its last restraint. Above, the sun has been smothered into a faint, bloodshot light, a pale eye blinking through the thick, choking haze. The air tastes not of smoke but iron—hot, metallic, and ancient—like something primordial has awakened with the fire.

I run, barefoot across scorched earth that weeps beneath each footstep, blistering my soles with each desperate motion forward. To my left, a grove of trees erupts into flame with a low growl that builds to a screech. Their branches twist and snap like violin strings pulled taut and broken. The leaves burn in spirals of orange and violet, littering the hot wind like dying butterflies. The terrain shifts beneath me—the ground cracking open, revealing thin, flickering veins of magma that begin to pulse with a rhythm uncannily close to my own heartbeat.

Flames creep to my right, now. Towering walls of fire—alive, breathing—licking the sky as though trying to taste the moon through the smoke. There is no escape. All roads have become dead ends flocked by inferno. Yet, my legs move, over and over. Running even as my lungs fill with ash and my breaths grow short and shallow. Time stretches like taffy; each second drags against my skin like rough cloth.

Everywhere, the heat fights me. I feel it in my marrow now, not as pain but as presence. It speaks. The fire is saying something only my bones can understand, a silent cacophony of echoes from long-dead starlight. Each roar of flame becomes words, half-formed symbols burned into the inside of my skull. *This is where you end.* No, not end. *Rebirth?* Or transformation? The fire is not cruel—it’s simply inevitable.

Then, in the distance, a shape begins to form through the heat distortion. Something moves fluidly between flames, unaffected by the blaze’s fury. A creature—neither beast nor man—covered in fur like molten embers, with eyes like twin suns eclipsed by sorrow. It watches me as I burn inside. Not to save me. Not to kill me. Just to *observe* as I face the place where fear turns into prayer, and prayer into flight.

And when the walls of fire collapse inward, and the earth begins to fracture, and I can run no further, I stop.

Instead, I embrace it.

The fire.

The creature watches.

And I am not dead yet—for I see my own shadow outlined in flame, standing tall amidst the blaze, screaming a sound that does not belong to this world.

Then everything turns white.

And the dream folds inward, like a molten dreamcatcher swept into a celestial wind.  

I do not wake.

I *begin.*
