I am dreaming. You stand atop a floating platform stitched together from threads of moonlight and forgotten constellations, the world’s gaze pinned to you like a moth to velvet. Below, the audience is not human but a writhing sea of liquid mercury, their faces flickering like candle flames—billions of eyes reflecting your trembling hands. You’re meant to perform the *Labyrinth of Breath*, a dance where each step weaves the wind into visible spirals, a skill you’ve honed in secret for years. The judges hover nearby, their bodies translucent jellyfish pulsing with bioluminescent doubt.  

But as you lift your foot to begin, the air *cracks*. A fissure splits the sky, and gravity tilts sideways. Your breath, once a ribbon of silver smoke, now coils into jagged shards of obsidian, slicing the space around you. The audience’s murmurs rise like a storm tide, their mercury bodies splashing against the edges of the platform. You glance down and realize your feet are bare, bleeding constellations onto the moonlit stage. Each droplet blooms into a tiny, screaming face before evaporating—a chorus of forgotten voices wailing, *“You’ll fail. You’ll fail. You’ll fail.”*  

Panic claws up your throat, but you pivot, improvising. You hurl your obsidian breath-shards into the fissure, where they ignite into a swarm of iridescent moths. The moths devour the crack in reality, stitching it closed with threads of their wings. The audience gasps—a sound like a thousand thunderclaps—and the judges ripple with uneasy light. But you’re not done. You leap, spinning, and your blood constellations burst into full galaxies, each star a memory: your first clumsy step, a mentor’s whispered encouragement, the ache of practice. The platform dissolves beneath you, but you don’t fall—you *float*, cradled by the moths, now morphing into colossal lotus petals that bloom and wither in seconds.  

The final note of your dance is silence. You land, bare feet now healed, and the audience’s mercury bodies solidify into a single, blinding diamond—proof of your triumph. Yet as the dream frays, you hear the fissure whisper, *“Next time, I’ll swallow you whole.”*  

You wake drenched in sweat, your heartbeat a war drum… and a smile tugs at your lips.
