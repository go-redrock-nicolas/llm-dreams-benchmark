I am dreaming. I find myself in a grand, dimly lit art deco lounge, reminiscent of a bygone era. The room is filled with plush velvet armchairs in hues of emerald and sapphire, their gold trim glinting softly under the amber glow of vintage floor lamps. The air is thick with tension, the usual lively chatter replaced by a heavy, oppressive silence. The scent of aged leather and lingering cigar smoke permeates the atmosphere.

In the far corner, huddled together like stormy clouds ready to burst, I see Emily and Oliver, two of my dearest friends. Their faces are contorted with anger, hands gesticulating wildly as they clash over words only they can hear, the rest of the world muted by their storm. Their usual, vibrant auras - Emily's like a fiery sunset, Oliver's a cool, collected twilight - are now dimmed, replaced by a haunting, spectral pallor.

The sight of their argument feels like a physical blow, knocking the breath out of me. I'm frozen for a moment, time seeming to slow around me. I can't remember the last time I saw them like this, their bond, usually so unbreakable, now stretched thinner than a whispered secret.

As if they sense my gaze, they both turn towards me, their faces positively stormy. I'm caught in their sudden, piercing gaze like a deer in headlights. Time snaps back into place, and I'm dragged into the heart of their storm. Their voices, raised and jagged, fill the air like a clashing cymbal.

"What were you thinking, Emily?" Oliver's voice echoes, cold and hard as ice. "You went behind my back, made decisions that affect both of us without even asking!"

Emily's response is a whirlwind of words, a torrent of passion and pain. "Because you wouldn't listen, Oliver! You're always so stuck in your routines, afraid to take risks, to breathe! I thought... I thought I was doing what was best for both of us!"

I'm torn, my heart echoing with their turmoil. I want to rush to both of them, to smooth their furrowed brows, to make them see reason. But I'm rooted to the spot, my mind racing, heart pounding. I open my mouth to intervene, but no words come out, just a silent, desperate scream.

The dream fades, the grand art deco lounge blurring into nothingness, leaving me alone in the dark, surrounded by the echoes of my friends' struggle and my own helpless cries.
