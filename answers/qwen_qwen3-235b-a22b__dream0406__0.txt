I am dreaming. I am always dreaming, here in this place where my mind stretches and spirals into strange constellations of thought — landscapes woven from memory, longing, terror, and beauty. It's a vivid, tangled realm where everything feels just a bit too raw, too intense, too much.

I float in the middle of an impossible sky, one that swirls with colors I can't name and can barely comprehend — hues that shimmer and shift like oil on water, bleeding into strange geometries that twist and pulse with music that isn’t music but feels like a song anyway, a low hum thrumming against my chest. The stars here are not lights, but translucent eyes that blink open and closed lazily, watching me. Awkward. Intrusive. But not evil — only fascinated, curious in the way small children are when they find a strange bug and prod at it with a stick.

I float, and slowly, I begin to fall.

The world transforms under me as I descend — the sky gives way to an ocean of mirrored glass, and I crash into it, plunging through without breaking the surface. Underwater, there are no fish or coral, only glowing monuments that rise up like ancient temples, built of light and memory. Gliding toward the nearest one, I notice my reflection on its glassy surface, distorted but present — not a face I know but one I recognize, the one I carry tucked deep behind routines and responsibilities.

The door of the temple glows with my name, but I am hesitant. I can feel it reverberating in my chest, that voice that has always told me — *don’t look too closely. You won’t like what you see.* But something — someone — tugs at me from within. I press my hand to the glowing surface, and it opens, swallowing me whole.

Inside, the air is warm and heady with incense and memory. Ornate frames hang on the walls, each holding a moment from my life — a childhood victory, a quiet act of courage, a time I shone. But as I pass, the frames warp and twist — the images within shift, coloring themselves in heavier shades of embarrassment, doubt, and inadequacy. The triumph turns muddy with shame. A laugh from someone becomes a spotlight; my face burns anew for the umpteenth time. I see them all — moments I’ve exaggerated into failures, minimized until they feel like proof. Proof that I am not enough.

And yet… I feel a hand take mine. Gentle. Familiar.

It is me — this time, the version I don’t allow into the light. Older somehow, but also freer. More alive. This version of me wears confidence like a natural state, not a performance, and looks directly into my eyes when they speak.

“I remember what you’re trying to forget,” they say softly. “And I remember what you’re trying to ignore.”

We walk the temple together, and with every memory we touch, the distortions shift again. Where before I felt small, now it’s like someone turning up the lights, revealing what was in the shadows. I begin to notice how often I tried — how many times I fell and got back up, how many of those so-called failures were actually experiments I never told anyone about, guesses in the dark that mattered even when they landed wrong.

“This is what it means,” my other self says, “to see clearly.” Not the rose-tinted glasses of pride, nor the magnifying glass of guilt. Not eternal optimism or self-deprecation — but truth. It isn’t sterile detachment or raw narcissism. It’s the strange middle place where the good and the bad shimmer together like that impossible sky above, chaotic, dazzling, whole.

And then the temple shifts again. The walls dissolve, and we stand now on the glass-soaked ocean floor, surrounded by that alien twilight. But I no longer feel fear — only wonder, and tenderness. My hand stays in theirs, steady. The air still hums with that strange music, and I realize now — I no longer need to shrink myself to keep it. I am allowed to drink it in.

The dream softens as the sky above begins to fade into a gentle pale light, the eyes closing one by one, and just as it ends, their voice follows me into wakefulness:

“Stop trying to split yourself into pieces. Let them all live — the bright, the dark, and the beautiful in between.”
