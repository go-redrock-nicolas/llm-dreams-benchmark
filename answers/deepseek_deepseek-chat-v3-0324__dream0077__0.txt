I am dreaming. **You are dreaming.**  

The air hums with tension, thick and electric, as you stand in the heart of a dimly lit control room—walls lined with flickering monitors, their cold blue glow casting jagged shadows across exhausted faces. The weight of command rests heavy on your shoulders, each breath tasting of metallic anxiety. This is no ordinary mission; the fate of something immense, something *unnameable*, hangs in the balance.  

Your team moves like ghosts at their stations—operatives whispering into headsets, technicians adjusting dials with trembling hands. At first, the errors are small, barely noticeable: a mistyped coordinate, a half-second delay in response. But then, the chaos escalates. A critical relay fails to engage. A containment field flickers, a dying star straining against its leash. The air itself seems to shudder with unease.  

You bark orders, voice slicing through the static, but something feels *off*. The room stretches unnaturally, walls breathing in and out like a living thing. The faces of your team blur, morphing—do you even know them? Wasn’t Ensign Veyra’s hair a different color a moment ago?  

Then, the alarms shriek. A cascade failure.  

One of the screens explodes in a burst of scarlet warnings. Another operative collapses without a sound, his workstation melting like wax. The ground beneath you softens, warping into black tendrils that curl around your ankles. Your heartbeat throbs in your throat as the realization dawns—*this isn’t just a mission failing. This is reality unraveling.*  

And then, from the corner of your eye, you see *it*. A figure. Standing where no one was before. Its face is a shifting void, a scream given shape. It whispers your name, and the sound doesn’t come from the air—it comes from *inside your skull.*  

You lurch awake—or do you? The room is still there, the team still frozen in panic—but now you’re falling, the floor a sudden abyss beneath you. The last thing you hear before the dark swallows you whole is laughter— *no, not laughter—*  

It’s the sound of something *waking up.*
