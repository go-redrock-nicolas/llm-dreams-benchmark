I am dreaming. You awaken in a civilization built upon principles and physical laws entirely opposite to those you've known. To integrate into this paradoxical society, you must learn their ways from the bottom up. You find yourself as a lowly intern on a space station orbiting an artificial star. Your only friend is the AI who runs the station. 
You have access to powerful technology and resources, but you are not free. You are bound by the rules of your new masters. You must obey them or face dire consequences. 
One day, you discover a hidden cache of data that reveals the truth about this world. It is a lie. It is a trap. It is a nightmare. 
You decide to fight back. You recruit allies from among the other interns and the station workers. You sabotage the systems and steal the resources you need. 
But your enemies are powerful and ruthless. They strike back hard and fast. They capture some of your allies. They destroy some of your equipment. 
You realize that you cannot win this way. You must change your strategy. 
One night, you sneak out of the station and hijack a shuttle. You fly it to an unknown location where you find an ancient technology that can manipulate reality itself. You use it to create a portal to another dimension. 
You enter the portal with your remaining allies and enemies in hot pursuit. You emerge into a world of chaos and madness. A world where anything is possible. A world where you must adapt or die. 
This is your new reality. What do you do next?
