I am dreaming. And I have found myself standing at the edge of the world, where the sky splinters into ribbons of fire and ice, and the air tastes of copper and forgotten whispers. I can feel the cold of infinity beneath my bare feet, and above me, constellations shift with a purposeful intelligence, like eyes peering down from incalculable heights. Beneath this sky, I am small—so very small—yet I dare not flinch.

I’ve been here before.

This place was born of a wound carved long ago—a memory of failure so acute, it still echoes in the marrow of my courage. I see it now, rising from the horizon like a cathedral of fear: a great and spiraling tower of black glass, reflecting every doubt I’ve ever harbored, every word that struck me down, every moment I crumbled behind a grin and told the world I didn’t care.

The tower hums with a sound like memory unraveling.

Tonight, though, it feels...different. The wind carries the voices of the past not with mockery, but with solemn recognition. They speak of my falls: the time I stood before many and failed to speak, the time I reached out and was refused, the time aspiration met reality with catastrophic reality. Every echo trembles through the air, vibrating inside my chest like forgotten songs.

Yet I… do not flee.  
I do not shut my eyes.

Instead, I step forward, crossing the threshold into the tower’s glassy spine.

Inside, I fall through the reflections. But these aren’t just images anymore—they are corridors of feeling, textured with emotion and sorrow. One moment I'm six again, trembling as I trip during a school play, the laughter cutting sharper than wind. Then I'm twenty, choking back tears at a desk where my hands trembled too much to write the exam I had studied for so long.

I pause in those moments now. I kneel beside the child who once went silent behind shame, and I whisper: *“You were trying. That matters more than applause.”*  
I reach toward the young man at the desk, and I say, *“Breathe. Fear doesn’t mean failure. It means you carry something that matters.”*

With every step deeper into this Tower of Reflections, I feel myself shift. The silence isn't a tomb anymore; it's a garden. Shadows curl and disperse. And I begin to *weave* with the feeling—so long kept buried—that I had never been whole enough.

In the center of the tower, there is a mirror unlike the others.

It does not reflect.

It absorbs.

And standing before it, I finally see what hides in that mirror: not shame, not the child or the trembling student, not even the proud adult I wish to be. Just... a luminous, flickering *me*. Not broken, not invincible—alive through its flaws, shaped by its stumbles.

And suddenly, a third voice emerges, unlike the others—soft yet resonant, full of paradox.

*“You cannot perfect your way to worth,”* it murmurs.  
**“But you can stand.”**

And so I do.

In that infinite tower, I stand.

And in that standing, power quietly unfurls like wings I never knew were there.

The sky opens. Not violently, not magically, but with grace.

From above, threads of light cascade, weaving around the shards of darkness like dancers in mid-twirl, and I rise through them—not on wings or wind, but on *acceptance.* I don’t fly; I simply ascend, pulled upward by some ancient force that none can name, but all carry within.

I am not perfect.  
I am not yet healed.

But I am—finally—*mine* to carry.

And that is more than enough.

The dream ends in silence.

But a warmth stays behind.  
Like a seed.  
Like a promise.

And you awaken knowing... tomorrow, you will not fear the fall.
