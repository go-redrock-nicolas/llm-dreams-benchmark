I am dreaming. I find myself in a glass office building where all the walls are fogged mirrors. As I walk down the endless corridor, I catch glimpses of my reflection, but each time I look, my face appears slightly different - sometimes older, sometimes younger, sometimes wearing a corporate suit, other times dressed in vibrant artistic clothing splattered with paint.

The floor beneath my feet keeps shifting between polished marble and soft grass sprouting wildflowers. With each step, I leave behind either pristine footprints or blooming patches of violets and daisies. Other people in the hallway seem to glide by in perfect synchronization, all wearing identical gray suits and expressionless faces.

They keep trying to hand me a gray suit of my own, their movements mechanical yet insistent. But every time I reach to take it, my hands transform into swirling patterns of watercolor that drip through their fingers. My skin begins to shimmer with moving images - fragments of poetry, half-finished paintings, dance movements I've always longed to try.

The air grows thick with whispers: "Conform... conform... conform..." But the whispers compete with a melody that seems to emerge from within my own chest - a wild, beautiful song in a language I've never heard but somehow understand completely. The more I listen to this internal music, the more the glass walls around me begin to crack in intricate spiderweb patterns.

Suddenly, I realize my body is becoming transparent, filling with swirling galaxies and constellations. The other figures try to grab me, to pull me back into their ordered lines, but their hands pass right through my star-filled form. The cracking walls finally shatter, but instead of glass, they release thousands of butterflies in every color imaginable.

As the butterflies swarm around me, I feel myself dissolving into pure light - not disappearing, but rather becoming more real than I've ever been. The corporate maze transforms into an endless canvas stretching in all directions, and my light-self begins to paint reality with colors that don't even exist in the waking world.

Just before the dream fades, I understand: I am both the artist and the art, the song and the singer, the dream and the dreamer. The pressure to conform dissolves into the simple truth of being.

The dream begins to blur at the edges, but the melody from my chest continues to resonate, a reminder that authenticity isn't just a choice - it's the very essence of existence.
