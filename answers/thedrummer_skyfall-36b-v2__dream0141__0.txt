I am dreaming. You are dreaming.

Suddenly, your minds eye springs open, flooding your dreamscape with a rushed reality as surreal as it is disturbing.

The stage is set for what is meant to be the defining moment of your career. The adrenaline surges through your body, coursing through your veins like a wild, untamable creature. You can feel the weight of anticipation pressing down upon you, the expectant energy of the audience buzzing like a swarm of bees behind the velvet curtains.

As the opening notes ring out, you realize, with a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach that this is not the performance you've been planning, not the polished masterpiece you've been rehearsing for months or even years.

No, this is something else entirely.

Your fingers, poised to dance across the instrument you've mastered, move of their own accord, playing a melody you've never heard before. It emerges from within, something deeply buried in the farthest recesses of your subconscious. The score, written in a language you understand, spills out into the concert hall, driving you forward, carrying the audience with it as if upon the crest of a roaring wave.

You tremble as you step deeper into the spotlight, caught up in the dream-logic of your alter ego, one who moves and plays with a confidence born of pure instinct. You feel the fear and uncertainty melting away, replaced by a freedom so exhilarating, it borders on enchantment. The music swells, building to a frenzy that leaves your body slick with sweat and your soul aching to be heard.

Lost in this strange and unsettling current of your own creation, you wonder: Is this success your conscious mind wishes to hide, Minimum?‚Äù or is it perhaps */forbidden*/ toships being harmed.?

Is this performance your greatest feat, or your most haunting regret?

As the final notes fade away, and the applause swells into a deafening roar, you realize that perhaps, in the end, the two are not so different.
