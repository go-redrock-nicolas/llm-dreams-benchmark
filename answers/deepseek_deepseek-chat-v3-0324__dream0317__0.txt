I am dreaming. The edges of my vision swim with the liquid iridescence of a soap bubble's surface—shimmering hues of violet and gold swirl at the periphery of my sight. The air itself crackles with unseen energy, thick with the scent of ozone and something sweetly unfamiliar, like the memory of a fruit I’ve never tasted.

I stand before a towering archway woven not of stone or metal but of living vines, their leaves a surreal cobalt blue, pulsing faintly as though breathing. They twine around each other in impossible, gravity-defying patterns, forming shapes that shift when I blink—one moment a coiled serpent, the next an outstretched hand. A low, resonant hum thrums through my bones, as if the archway is singing in a voice just beyond human hearing.

Beyond the arch, the landscape is a fever-dream collision of elements: Fields of crystalline grass tinkle like wind chimes underfoot while waterfalls flow upward into mauve-tinged clouds. Strange creatures move in the distance—some with too many limbs, others with luminous wings that leave comet-trails of silver dust in their wake. The horizon shimmers like a mirage, where jagged obsidian mountains float weightlessly above an endless, star-studded sea.

I take a step forward, and the ground beneath me exhales a warm mist that carries whispers in a language I somehow understand— *"Choice/Warning/Gift"*—before dissolving into laughter like chimes. My skin prickles with a thrilling electricity. Every instinct tells me this world is alive in ways I can’t comprehend, watching, waiting to see what I’ll do next. The dream holds its breath.
