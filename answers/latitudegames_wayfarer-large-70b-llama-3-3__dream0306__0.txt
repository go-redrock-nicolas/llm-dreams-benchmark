I am dreaming. Your vivid dream unfolds in the deep quiet of your mind, where imagination knows no bounds. Colors more vivid than reality paint the landscape, sounds echo with perfect clarity. Time distorts, stretches, contracts—unlimited by earthly constraints.

You stand at a crossroads, two paths laid out before you. One leads to the fulfillment of your core values, but its path is rocky and treacherous. Pragmatism calls from the other, promising ease and practical benefits—but at a cost to what you hold dear.

The air thrums with tension as you weigh your choices. Reality shifts and ripples around you, influenced by your every thought. Will you stand firm by your principles, no matter the cost? Or will pragmatism's siren song draw you down its more comfortable road?
