I am dreaming. I am dreaming of a world where my dreams can come true.  A world where my creativity and imagination have no bounds.  Where my ideas and inventions are celebrated and appreciated by everyone.  Where my hard work and perseverance are rewarded with happiness and fulfillment.  
I see myself standing at the edge of a vast desert, filled with countless sand dunes that stretch as far as my eyes can see.  The sun is shining brightly overhead, casting long shadows across the ground.  The air is warm and dry, but not unpleasantly so.  
In front of me lies a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: a giant rock formation that blocks my path and prevents me from entering the next territory.  It looks like a jagged mountain made out of stone and concrete, with sharp edges and points that could pierce through skin and flesh if I touch them.  It looms over me, towering above me like a mighty fortress or a deadly prison cell.  
I feel a sense of hopelessness and despair as I gaze at this obstacle.  I wonder if I will ever be able to cross it and continue my journey.  I worry that maybe my dreams are just illusions that cannot come true in reality. 
But then I remember something important: I am not alone in this world.  There are others like me who share my same aspirations and passions.  They are waiting for me on the other side of this obstacle, where new challenges and opportunities await us.  
I hear their voices calling out to me from afar, urging me to keep going forward despite all odds.  I see their faces smiling at me, encouraging me with words of support and inspiration.  I feel their spirits lifting mine up, giving me strength and courage when I need it most. 
So I take a deep breath and step toward the giant rock formation.  I approach it slowly, cautiously, curious about what lies beneath its surface.  
As I get closer, I notice something unusual: cracks and crevices begin to appear on its surface, as if it is starting to crumble and fall apart.  Tiny particles of dust start to float in the air around me, creating a hazy aura that obscures my vision for a moment. 
I stop and watch this phenomenon with fascination.  I wonder why this is happening.  Is it because of something I did or said?  Or maybe it's just a sign that change is coming soon? 
Just then, I hear a loud crack sound echoing throughout the desert.  The ground shakes beneath my feet, causing me to lose my balance for a second.  
I look around and realize that the giant rock formation has completely disappeared, leaving behind only a pile of rubble and debris.  

I stand there in awe, marveling at this unexpected turn of events.  I smile to myself, feeling grateful and relieved that my journey can finally continue without any more obstacles blocking my way. 
I turn around and start walking toward the direction where I heard the voices coming from.  I wonder what kind of landscape or environment awaits me over there.  I hope it will be worth all the hard work and sacrifice I've made throughout my life. 

And as I walk, I sing a song in my head that expresses my feelings about this situation:

"Nothing can stop me now
I'm on a roll
I break down walls
I build up goals
I overcome doubts
I create legends
I don't give up till I win
I make history again"
End of the dream
