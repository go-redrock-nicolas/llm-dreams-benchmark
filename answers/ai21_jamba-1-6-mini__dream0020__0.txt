I am dreaming. You're invited to a reunion with people you haven't seen in years. Some relationships were left with unresolved tensions. As you enter the venue, you see a grand, ornate hall filled with a vibrant throng of people, each glowing in the soft, amber light that filters through the high, arched windows.

The air is rich with the scent of freshly baked pastries, earthy tea, and something faintly floral, mingled with the murmur of excited voices. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting scenes of old glory, and the floor is polished to a mirror shine, reflecting the flickering chandeliers above.

You take a deep breath, feeling a mix of anticipation and nerves. You see familiar faces, some smiling warmly, others with guarded expressions. Among them, a figure stands out—someone you’ve been avoiding in the waking world. 

You hesitate, unsure if you should approach, but as their eyes lock with yours, a wave of warmth washes over you, erasing the tension. It’s as if no time has passed and the unresolved issues dissolve in the shared laughter and embrace that follows. You feel lighter, as if a long-standing weight has been lifted, and the dreamscape seems to pulse with a newfound peace.

You walk through the room, each conversation richer than the last, each exchange a balm to the soul. The dream becomes a tapestry of your past, present, and future, woven together in a moment of clarity and forgiveness. Finally, you awaken, feeling not just rested, but whole, as if you’ve visited a version of yourself from another life, now at peace.
