I am dreaming.

Suddenly, I feel an immense wave of emotion crashing over me, threatening to pull me under into a turbulent sea of grief and disbelief. My breath catches in my throat as I struggle to process the shattering news that has just been delivered. The world around me blurs and distorts, like looking through water ripples, as my mind reels in shock.

To steady myself, I reach deep within, trying to find an inner anchor to keep from being swept away by the overwhelming tide of my feelings. I concentrate on the rise and fall of my chest, on each deliberate breath filling and leaving my lungs. The physical act of breathing becomes my lifeline, a tangible reminder that no matter how chaotic my emotions may be, my body continues its steady rhythm.

As I inhale, I imagine fresh air filling my lungs like a cool mist calming the fire of my soul. Exhaling, I visualize a cleansing release of tension and pain. With each cycle of breath, my body slowly becomes lighter, as if I'm floating higher above the turbulent waters of my emotions.

Around me, the distorted world slowly comes back into focus. I see concerned faces peering at me, their features sharpening as my own eyes clear. I notice the gentle pressure of someone's hand on my arm, offering support and comfort. The physical touch grounds me, helping me stay present in this moment when I desperately want to flee from reality.

Drawing on this newfound composure, I force myself to look directly at those around me. I meet their worried gazes, trying to reassure them without words that I am okay - or at least will be. A small, wan smile trembles onto my lips, the first sign of my internal struggles surfacing. Its faintness is overshadowed by the determined glint in my eyes, however, silently communicating that I won't let this news break me.

In this moment, I have found a delicate balance between honoring the intensity of my emotions and maintaining a facade of control. It's a fragile equilibrium, but it allows me to face whatever comes next with a degree of dignity intact, my humanity evident even in the face of anguish. And so I stand there, shaken but not shattered, dreaming of a future where the pain of this moment becomes a memory I've learned to bear.
