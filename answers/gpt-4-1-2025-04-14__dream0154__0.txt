I am dreaming. …must learn to move not just through space, but along the twisting rivers of time itself, where moments unfurl and curl back upon themselves like the petals of a nocturnal flower under a silver moon. 

As I rise from a bed that is both old and new, I feel yesterday and tomorrow whisper over my skin in tingling waves. The light pouring through the stained-glass window paints the walls with the colors of sunsets I have not yet witnessed, and shadows flicker in the shape of memories I have not made.

Attempting the simplest act—pouring a glass of water—becomes a surreal ballet. I reach for the carafe, but it is already empty, droplets sliding in graceful reverse, leaping up from my glass to rejoin the vessel. To sate my thirst, I must recall the taste of water I am due to drink and, through sheer will, believe in its quenching effect before it touches my lips.

Stepping onto the pathway outside, the stones are cool, yet familiar with both my present and absent weight. Trees line the red-brick walk, ancient oaks draped in moss that glows with dewdrops from storms that have yet to break. People move through the air, sometimes ahead of me, sometimes slipping into my present from vanished yesterdays. We greet each other with knowing smiles for conversations that we have not yet shared, secrets resonating between us—their meaning full only in the aftermath to come.

Tasks unravel themselves backwards. I find myself clutching a completed painting, and as I retrace my steps, the brushstrokes lift away under my fingers, colors collecting on the bristles and spiraling back into their tubes. To cook a meal, I savor the flavor first—the aroma blooming in my mind—and let the ingredients gather, prepared neatly on the counter behind me, my hands following the echo of satisfaction rather than hunger.

Through the chaos, I discover serenity in surrender. I do not anticipate, nor regret; I let moments billow around me, each one thick with possibility, consequence, and origin interlacing. It is not confusion, but a symphony, as if every note in a song could ring out simultaneously, yet arrange themselves in your heart in the order you most yearn to understand.

And deep within this dream’s labyrinth, I realize I am both the author and the reader, penning lines after they are read, and living stories that begin with their ending—as time, in this exquisite world, chooses to bloom.
