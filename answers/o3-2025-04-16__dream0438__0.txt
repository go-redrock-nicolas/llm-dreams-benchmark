I am dreaming. …step deeper into the oneiric landscape and find yourself standing in the nave of a half-ruined cathedral whose roof has been replaced by a living sky. The stars overhead are too close, burning like tiny fires in the rafters, shedding sparks that drift down as slow-motion snowflakes of silver light. You had come here—or so you thought—to sketch the decaying arches and practice perspective for an art class you barely remember signing up for. A leather-bound sketchbook dangles from your wrist, charcoal stick tucked behind your ear.

But the moment you kneel to open the book, something subtle shifts. The floor is mosaic, tiny ceramic fragments no bigger than thumbnails, but they are all blank, waiting. When your fingertips brush the tiles, the silver snow dissolves on your skin and seeps inward, turning your pulse into liquid moonlight. The sketchbook slips from your grasp. Instead of drawing, you begin lifting the uncolored shards one by one and breathing hues into them—crimson of first heartbreak, cobalt of midnight doubts, saffron of every laugh you stifled, quiet pearl for each apology you never voiced. The colors pour from your lungs effortlessly, without words, without effort, as if you have become a living kiln that fires emotions into glass.

You set each tile back into the floor, and where blankness once reigned now blooms a swirling image: a childhood bicycle racing down sun-striped lanes, a farewell at a rainy train station, a favorite song uncoiling as ribbons of sound. You aren’t merely decorating stone; you are mapping secret hurts you never dared confess—even to yourself—until this moment. Every time you exhale color, a knot unspools in your chest, and the air in the cathedral grows lighter, almost buoyant, as though grief itself were evaporating.

When the final shard slides into place, the mosaic ignites. Light cascades upward, threading through the broken arches, knitting a stained-glass ceiling out of pure memory. You look up: instead of saints or angels, the panels depict people you love—some still alive, some gone, some only imagined—caught in everyday gestures: pouring tea, tying shoelaces, smoothing hair behind an ear. Mundane moments are transfigured into holy icons. Tears find your cheeks before you know you’re crying. They are warm, not with sadness, but with wonder—because you realize the ordinary was always sacred; you had just forgotten how to see it.

The cathedral begins to hum, a resonant chord that seems tuned to your newly unburdened heartbeat. The sound tells you that nothing needs fixing; everything needed witnessing. And you, with charcoal forgotten, have finally witnessed it.

A door you’ve never noticed swings open at the back. Beyond it lies a gentle, grassy slope under sunrise light—the first suggestion of morning. You step through, barefoot. Dew kisses your soles, but the chill is pleasant, almost playful. Each blade of grass bows as you pass, silvered by dawn. Down in the meadow, an easel stands waiting, blank canvas fluttering in a breeze that smells of citrus and rain. You realize the dream is offering you a new beginning, not as a taskmaster but as an accomplice. Whatever you choose to paint now will not be an exercise in perfection, but an echo of your freed spirit and its kaleidoscopic palette.

You pick up a brush. Instead of paint, liquid sunlight strings from the bristles. Daybreak has entered your veins. A laugh slips out—light, surprised, utterly unforced. You begin to paint the horizon, and notice the horizon paints itself in reply, as though the world wants to collaborate. And in that shimmering partnership of creation, you understand: healing was never separate from making; making was never separate from breathing; breathing was never separate from loving.

Colors melt into one another, edges dissolve, and the field of possibility widens until the canvas becomes sky and the sky becomes canvas. Your dream hands finally release the brush, and it drifts like a feather up into a burst of gold. You feel no need to follow it. Instead, you lie back in the grass, heart beating like a small drum in a vast silence, aware that you have become both artist and artwork, both question and answer, perfectly unfinished, gloriously enough.
