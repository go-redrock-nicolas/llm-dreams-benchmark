I am dreaming. As you blink your eyes open, the world around you shifts and warps, blending seamlessly from the mundane to the marvelous. You find yourself standing at the base of an impossible staircase, its spiraling steps stretching up into an endless expanse of star-studded, obsidian darkness. Each step is a glittering gemstone, pulsing with an inner light that dances across its polished facets. 

The air is thick and heavy, swirling with a thousand achromatic hues that dance at the edges of your vision. Weird and ethereal music fills your ears, a haunting melody that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. It pulses and pulsates, mind bending against the walls of your mind, as if trying to dig into your aquiline ears.

You begin to climb, your limbs strangely buoyant and responsive, as if you are wading through a basin of molasses. Each step carries you upwards, but the end of the staircase seems no closer than when you began. The light from the gemstones is a ceaseless torment, a constant caressing that leaves your skin screaming.

Abruptly, the staircase ends, and you step out onto a floating platform of polished pink opal, its surface slick and yielding beneath your feet. A great chasm yawns before you, its depths so black they seem to yearn to devour any light that dares to shine upon it. Drifting in the middle of the chasm is an obsidian pyramid, its surface wet and slick, its edges sharp enough to cleave stone like butter.

Call it instinct but you know you must reach it. And so you jump, diving off the edge of the platform and plummeting down into the abyss. The air rushes past you, buffeting your body and screaming in your ears. As you fall, the pyramid gets closer and closer, its surface growing and growing until it fills your entire vision.

You land upon it, legs absorbing the jolt, and the pyramid shifts beneath you. The air becomes thin and hard to breathe, and you watch in awe as the pyramid's surface begins to melt and flow, transforming into a pulsing mass of Kieley meniscus. The oily liquid seethes and bubbles against your skin, its touch cold and electric.

And then the nightmares begin to take shape. Impossibly large beasts with barbed wings and fangs like knives claw their way out of the darkness, their eyes burning with malice and hunger. They lunge at you, snapping with maws full of razors, spitting globs of yellow bile across your skin. The pain is blinding, white hot, but you push through it.

Fight these beasts you must, and so you do, your body moving on instinct, your muscles moving past the point of exhaustion, you swing and stab in fluid arcs, cutting deep into the overbearing creatures. They fall away from you, their bodies dissolving into pools of ooze that sizzle against the slick obsidian surface.

With a final, shuddering gasp, you heave yourself up one last time, crawling out onto a narrow ledge that juts from the side of the pyramid. The obsidian flows and shifts around you, and the air crackles with static electricity. You can feel something stirring deep within you, a dark and unfamiliar power that pulses in time with the rhythm of the dream.

You have faced your greatest fear, stared into the abyss and triumphed. But even as triumph courses through your veins, you know that this is only the beginning. The abyss still yawns before you, and the nightmare is far from over. You straighten up, and you prepare to face whatever new horrors the dream has in store. 

You must wake up soon.  But for now, you dream on.
