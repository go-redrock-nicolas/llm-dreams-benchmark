I am dreaming. # The Threshold of Echoes

I find myself standing at the edge of an impossible library that stretches infinitely in all directions. The bookshelves tower so high they disappear into clouds that drift lazily between the stacks. Each book spine glimmers with shifting symbols that seem almost readable from the corner of my eye, but dance away when I look directly at them.

The air tastes of cinnamon and old paper. I'm halfway through some monumental task—cataloguing these infinite tomes, perhaps—and my shoulders sag with the weight of it. The initial thrill has faded, leaving behind the grinding reality of the work still to come.

A small blue bird with iridescent feathers lands on my outstretched finger. "The crossing point is always the darkest," it says in a voice like distant wind chimes. "That's why most travelers turn back."

The bird leads me down a spiral staircase I hadn't noticed before. Each step plays a different musical note as my feet touch it. At the bottom, we enter a chamber where people sit around a circular pool. I recognize them somehow—they are all versions of myself from different moments when I nearly surrendered important journeys.

An elderly librarian approaches, her eyes containing galaxies. "The middle is where the magic happens," she whispers, placing a smooth river stone in my palm. It's warm and pulses with gentle light. "This is made from the compressed determination of all who persevered when continuing seemed impossible."

The stone melts into my skin, and suddenly I'm floating above a landscape pieced together from all my abandoned dreams—each one a vibrant island connected by bridges I never built.

The blue bird circles my head three times. "The second wind comes not from rest, but from remembering," it says, before dissolving into a shower of tiny stars that sink into my chest.

I wake—no, I continue dreaming—but now I'm climbing a mountain path. Each step is heavier than the last, yet I feel a renewed strength coursing through me, brilliant and steadfast like a river of light beneath my skin.
