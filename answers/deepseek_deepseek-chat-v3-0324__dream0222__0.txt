I am dreaming. The air in the chamber is thick with tension, a haze of perfumed smoke curling lazily from an ornate incense burner shaped like a coiled serpent. The delegates around the obsidian table are a patchwork of masks—literal and metaphorical. Lord Veyl’s silver half-mask glints in the candlelight, his visible lips stretched in a practiced smile, while Ambassador Zhore’s feathered headdress trembles with every subtle shift, betraying nerves.  

You watch their hands. Always their hands. Beneath the table, Lord Veyl’s gloved fingers tap, tap, tap an arrhythmic code against his dagger hilt. Zhore’s assistant, a shadow in violet silks, keeps brushing her thumb over the silver ring on her left hand—poison? A signal? You catch a flicker of movement in the high arches above—a servant? A spy?  

Then the High Consul speaks, voice like honey laced with venom. "We all desire peace," she murmurs, "but at what cost?" Her red-painted nails trace the rim of her goblet, where the wine swirls a suspiciously dark hue.  

Someone lies. No.  

Everyone lies.  

The candle flames gutter—for a second, shadows shudder, elongating into grasping tendrils. The faces around you ripple. For a heartbeat, you see their true forms beneath the masks: Lord Veyl’s face is nothing but hollow bone, Zhore’s skin writhes with spectral moths, the High Consul’s eyes are voids, hungry and endless—  

Then it’s gone.  

The negotiations continue.
