I am dreaming. In my dream, I'm sitting alone in the middle of an ancient forest where the trees seem to be alive with whispers, and I can't understand their language but I can feel everything. I'm sitting cross-legged on a moss-covered boulder surrounded by lush undergrowth, and an amber light filters through the forest canopy, making everything feel like it's bathed in the golden glow of sunset. Yet, the sun never seems to set. The birds are singing, but the melodies carry a resonance too profound for my ears, something both sorrowful and euphoric. I realize I am crying. 

It's not the usual sadness I feel in waking life, but something raw, untamed, like I've been bottling up so many emotions and this moment is the breaking point. I see, twisting through the leaves, this golden vine that mirrors my tears. The vine grows and wraps itself around me, not tight or smothering, but like a warm embrace. I don't know why, but I know I am connected to this forest, and it's responding to me. 

Suddenly, a voice echoes through the trees, saying, "This is what it means to feel, to truly feel." I don't see where the voice is coming from, but I don't feel scared. I feel, in that moment, like a part of something far greater than myselfâ€”something unending and infinite. My tears keep flowing, but in this dream, it feels like they're washing away everything heavy, leaving a lightness I don't often feel. 

Then, my chest tightens, and as if the forest has heard me, roots rise up from the ground and begin to weave around my legs. They pull me down, gently but firmly, into the dirt. It doesn't hurt, it feels almost like an answer, a grounding force telling me that it's okay to be here. I'm sinking into the earth, slowly becoming one with it. I feel the hum of the soil, the heartbeat of roots, the pulse of life beneath the surface. 

I stop crying, and I just exist, suspended in this serene, otherworldly place. The light never dims. The birds never stop singing. The vines never let go. I am so small, yet so connected, not just to myself but to something vast. And it feels like this space is one where being overwhelmed is a welcome experience. 

I wake up with a deep longing to get back to the forest.
