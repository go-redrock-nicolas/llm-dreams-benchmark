I am dreaming. You're maintaining a complex system where even minor deviations from protocol could have catastrophic consequences. When critical components start behaving erratically, you must identify the problem and correct it before it spirals out of control. 
But you also want to explore new possibilities and push boundaries. Sometimes that means breaking rules or ignoring warnings. 
You're being pulled in two directions by your own desires and responsibilities. You can't please everyone, but maybe you can satisfy yourself.
