I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The fluorescent lights of your office hum like a trapped wasp, their sterile glow bleeding into the cracks of your skull. The walls—once beige, sterile, forgettable—have begun to pulse, as though the building itself is alive, its veins throbbing with the ink-black residue of deadlines and resentment. Your desk is now a raft adrift in a sea of sticky notes, each one a screaming headline: *Overdue. Insufficient. Failure.* The keyboard beneath your fingers has melted into a nest of eels, their scales glinting with the oily sheen of unread emails.  

But then—a shift.  

The ceiling splits open like an overripe fruit, and moonlight spills through, silver and sweet. The air smells of burnt sage and jasmine, and suddenly you’re falling, not down, but *up*, through layers of cloud that crackle with auroras. You land softly on a bridge made of hummingbird bones, suspended over a canyon where the wind whispers in the voices of everyone who ever told you, *You’re not enough.* Below, rivers of liquid glass flow backward, carrying origami swans folded from your old pay stubs and performance reviews.  

A figure waits at the bridge’s apex—a woman with antlers made of subway maps and a cloak stitched from forgotten lullabies. Her eyes are closed-captioned subtitles, flickering with messages you can’t quite read. She hands you a key forged from your own ribcage, still warm, still bleeding stardust. “Turn it in the lock of your spine,” she says, her voice the sound of a thousand simultaneous heartbeats.  

You do.  

The key twists, and your vertebrae bloom into wings—translucent, veined with neon, humming with the electricity of a thousand stifled ideas. You launch into the sky, shedding skin like confetti: the suit becomes a swarm of monarch butterflies, the anxiety a plume of smoke that curls into the shape of a laughing child. You soar over a city where skyscrapers are made of stacked typewriters, and the streets are paved with teeth.  

There, in the heart of the metropolis, a clockwork tree grows from the hood of a rusted car. Its branches bear fruit that glows like lanterns, each one etched with a single word: *Enough. Rest. Begin.* You pluck one, and it dissolves on your tongue into a symphony—a memory of your grandmother’s hands, the smell of rain on pavement, the first time you ever felt free.  

The dream fractures.  

You wake at your desk, the eels now inert wires, the sticky notes blank. The woman with the antlers stands in the corner, fading like a Polaroid in sunlight. “You’re not trapped,” she murmurs, her voice already a rumor. “You’re a door.”  

And when you blink, the office is just an office again.  

But your hands—your hands are still hummingbird bones.
