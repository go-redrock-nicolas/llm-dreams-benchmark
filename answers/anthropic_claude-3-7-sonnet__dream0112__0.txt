I am dreaming. I stand atop a glass platform suspended between two impossibly tall skyscrapers, their tops disappearing into swirling violet clouds. Below me stretches a city unlike any on Earth—buildings of impossible geometry, some flowing like liquid metal, others defying gravity entirely. The air shimmers with an iridescent quality, catching sunlight from three different directions simultaneously.

I'm overseeing the construction of the Threshold—a magnificent bridge-like structure made of a crystalline material that responds to human thought. Each segment must align with neural-harmonic precision; the builders wear devices that translate their brainwaves into structural integrity. This isn't just architecture—it's the first passage between realities, each measurement calibrated to quantum tolerances.

My clipboard hovers before me, displaying holographic schematics that rotate and pulse with warning indicators. Something's wrong. I watch with growing horror as my chief engineer gestures to workers who begin fusing crystal segments that haven't been properly resonance-tuned. They're rushing, skipping the crucial mental synchronization process.

"Stop!" I shout, but my voice emerges as a cascade of colorful butterflies that dissolve in the air. The workers continue, their faces suddenly blank and identical, like copies of a single template. 

I push through air that feels thick as honey, reaching the edge where a worker is about to place the keystone—a piece that will permanently lock in all the dimensional flaws. The safety indicators are flashing crimson, projecting catastrophic failure statistics across the sky.

When I grab his arm, his skin feels like parchment, and beneath my fingers, his form begins to unravel like loose thread. He turns to me with eyes that are windows to a starless void and whispers, "Deadlines matter more than lives we cannot see."

The partially completed Threshold begins to hum, vibrating at a frequency that makes my teeth ache and my vision split into overlapping layers of reality...
