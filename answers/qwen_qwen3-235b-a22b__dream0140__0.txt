I am dreaming. The air is thick with expectations, crackling like static before a storm. I feel the scent of rain-soaked earth, even though no rain has fallen. I’ve arrived in the place where time is suspended and only the moment matters.

The stage is set in a cathedral that stretches into the stars, not built of stone but of light cascading in ribbons of gold, crimson, and violet. Its arches shimmer, rippling like reflections on fractured glass, responding to the very heartbeat of the competition. The arena pulses with a subtle hum of ancient magic. Massive crystalline chandeliers shine silently overhead, casting shadows that seem to shift of their own accord.

I am standing mid-stage, beneath an enormous clock with no hands. Its face bears only a single number: **1**. One final round. One chance left. The weight of failure is as tangible as the floor beneath my feet, an icy surface that glints faintly, though I feel no chill from it. The crowd beyond me, uncountable in number, intuits the significance of this moment. Even they seem to hold their collective breath, their usual noisy murmurs silenced. I wonder if they can feel gravity bending toward this singular point.

Opposite me stands my rival—shadowed, faceless, but utterly familiar in his presence. He isn’t a stranger; he is me without doubt, me without fear, me when I was at my most ruthless. A mirror of my ambition given form, though darker, sharper, and blanketed in silence. He stands like a predator that can wait forever and pounce in an instant.

The competition begins.

A cascade of crystalline bells rings at once—clear, sharp sounds, beautiful but urgent—and the challenge appears before us. Floating above the stage, glowing glyphs shimmer into existence: **"Build a world in the time it takes for the sand to fall."**

The world around me transforms again in a heartbeat, wild and breathtaking. Everything is burst open by a blind wind that carries whispers of forgotten languages and echoes of ancient galaxies. Massive hourglasses materialize beside us—hollowed obsidian structures standing as tall as towers, the upper halves filled with silver sand that glows with a cool, ghostly light.

I am given nothing but my will.

I kneel at the edge of a vast emptiness, the arena now transformed into infinite nothingness—a void so absolute it seems to drink the light around it. But within me, I feel the very pulse of creation, humming in my chest like a second heart. Somewhere deep in my mind, the architect of worlds wakes.

The moment I let it flow, creation pours from me like a roaring river. Towering mountains rise from the emptiness, their jagged peaks smashing up through clouds that crackle with emerald lightning. Rivers rush into being, carving through the valleys with whispers that sound like songs. The land renewing itself with every second.

In the distance, I see him building silently. My rival. Forests erupt into existence wherever he places his hand, vast and sprawling trees that twist into shapes that defy logic. Cities crawl out of the soil next to him, stone and aether congealing into structures of impossible geometry, each more perfect than the last. It becomes clear that he's not just building—his world is *perfect*. Inhumanly perfect.

But my world isn't perfect—it's alive. Imperfect vines tangle over the sides of cliffs; whales glide silently through skies made of mirrored water; moss climbs the bones of ancient giants I buried there myself, not knowing where they came from. My world breathes.

The sand begins its descent, falling like stars plummeting to the ground.

I feel time fraying now, trembling against my efforts. Flesh and bone cannot keep pace with such godlike demands, and my knees buckle. The weight of it all presses down—not just the competition, but the meaning of this moment. All the nights I trained while the rest of the world slept. Years spent doubting whether I was good enough. The faces of those who told me I’d never make it are flashing behind my eyes like ghosts refusing to disappear.

But now, now, I push harder than I ever thought possible. I plant my palm onto the ground and scream—not out of fear or agony, but of insatiable want, a want to make the world that burns inside me become real.

The void falls away. The audience begins to chant, though I cannot hear words. My world surges outward in waves of color and sound. Trees blossom with music, rivers hum the lullabies my mother once sang, and the sky becomes a canvas scribed with constellations only I know.

The final grain of sand slips through the hourglass.

Silence.

Then, an ethereal voice booms from everywhere and nowhere at all: ***Which world will endure?*** 

The clock face above us fractures with a blinding crack, and light pours through. I feel the weight of the dream pressing down on me—on all of us—as the choice of who wins is being decided not just on merit, but on the soul of the creator, the will to preserve what we make, to fight when everything falls. 

I close my eyes, knowing I gave everything. Knowing this moment is the culmination—the line between "possible" and "lost forever." I prepare for judgment, but just before it comes, I awaken...
