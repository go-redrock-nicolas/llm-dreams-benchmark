I am dreaming. I am dreaming of being stranded on a deserted island after a shipwreck with minimal survival supplies.  As days pass without rescue and resources dwindle, I feel helpless and hopeless.   My only companions are the sounds of nature - the waves crashing against the shore, the birds singing in the trees, the wind whispering through the grass.
I spend my time collecting water from the freshwater streams that run down the mountains, building shelters out of branches and leaves, foraging for food such as fruits, nuts, and berries.   I also have to protect myself from dangerous animals such as snakes, lions, tigers, etc.
One day while gathering wood for fire, I notice something shining in the sand.  Curious, I approach it and realize it's a silver coin with an engraving of a lion and a unicorn on either side.   I wonder where this coin came from and if it has any value.    Maybe I can use it to trade with other survivors or attract attention from passing boats.
Just then, I hear a sound coming from the water.  A splash?  A roar?  I freeze in fear, not knowing what to expect.   Suddenly, something emerges from the waves.   It's a giant sea lion!  But instead of attacking me, it seems friendly and curious.    It swims up to me and nudges my leg with its fin.
I reach out my hand and touch its rough skin.   It doesn't bite me or harm me in any way.   On the contrary, it makes me feel safe and warm inside. 
We spend the next hour playing together in the water - splashing each other, chasing one another, even singing songs to each other (at least I think we're singing).   Time flies when you're having fun with a friend.
As twilight approaches, we both head back to shore where our respective homes await us.  Before parting ways, we exchange gifts - me giving him some of my nuts and berries, him giving me one of his teeth (which he says is very hard and strong).   We promise to meet again tomorrow morning for breakfast.
And so ends my dream about being stranded on a deserted island after a shipwreck with minimal survival supplies.  What do you think about it?
