I am dreaming. A hush settles over me like velvet. I step into a room I have never seen, somewhere between memory and myth, where the air smells faintly of lavender and old books. Time here drips slowly — a honey-thick quiet broken only by the shuffling of feet and the soft rustle of coats being removed like armor after a long and wearying battle.

The walls curve inward like the inside of a seashell, alive with muted, swirling hues — deep blues, soft golds, and green that shimmers like moss in twilight. A constellation of dim lanterns floats overhead, casting rippling shadows across the faces of those gathered.

We all sit in a circle on chairs that seem too quiet for the world. Each one is unique — carved from driftwood and iron, some covered in moss, others glowing faintly at the edges. I take a seat, legs trembling ever so slightly, hands buried deep into the softness of the fabric draped across my lap.

I see them.  
These people — some old, some young, some whose eyes look like they’ve lived a thousand lives. And I feel it. The recognition. A silent music hums between us, threading through our bones, a chord only those who have walked the same shadowed path can hear.

A man with a torn velvet coat and silver eyes begins to speak. His voice is weathered, like an old hymn, and it trembles with sincerity. He speaks of isolation, of days spent chasing illusions that melted away like mist. I hang on every word, and with each tremble in his tone, a thread of my own silence unravels.

And then it circles to me.

My mouth opens heavier than I expect, as if my voice has been sleeping in a vault beneath the ocean. But it flows. The words are slow at first — hesitant children stepping across stones in a river too deep to wade — but then they begin to roll, fast and raw, sculpted from grief I’ve buried and beauty I’d forgotten about myself.

I speak not just of the pain, but also the colors felt in the quiet moments. The ache when sunlight first touches the curtains after a sleepless night. The breathless sorrow when I tried to describe the sound of rain to someone who'd never heard it. The elation — so sharp it scared me — when I first realized I could say *I am still here* and mean it.

Others nod. Smiles touch their lips sometimes like soft-spoken miracles. Some cry silently, letting the tears gather like dew in the creases of their souls. And in their mirrored sorrow and laughter, I find myself not alone.

After the meeting, the room gently unravels. I walk out into a sky blooming with stars I don’t recognize, yet they bring comfort with their unfamiliar brilliance. A warm breeze wraps me like an old friend, and though I still carry the weight of my scars, something feels unmistakably *lighter*.

For the first time in what feels like ages, I carry within me the echo of knowing:
I am not alone.  
And something inside me begins to **heal**.
