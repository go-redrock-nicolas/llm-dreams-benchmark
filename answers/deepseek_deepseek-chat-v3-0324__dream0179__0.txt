I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Weaver’s Loom**  

The air hums. Not with sound, but with *texture*—a shimmering, electric mist that clings to my skin like spider silk charged with storms. At first, I think it’s fog, but then I blink… and I *see*.  

Threads. Countless, glowing threads—crimson, gold, indigo—stretching from my fingertips into the swirling darkness. They thrum with borrowed heartbeats. One vibrates with the panic of a sparrow mid-flight; another pulses slow and syrupy, tied to the roots of an ancient oak. I gasp, and the threads sway like kelp in a tide. A tug at my navel: my own lifeline, platinum-bright, vanishing into the void behind me.  

Experimentally, I pluck a violet strand. It sings—a woman’s laughter, miles away—and as I pull, warmth floods my palms. Her joy becomes mine, effervescent as champagne. But when a frayed black cord brushes my wrist, I recoil: deathbed whispers, a dirge of wilted lupines. Horror prickles—*I could steal this, hoard it, snap it like a rotten harp string*—  

Then, the Loom appears.  

A colossal loom of bone and starlight, its warp and weft woven from every thread in existence. My hands move without thought: here, I mend a broken strand with a hummed lullaby; there, I braid the frenzied threads of dueling wolves until their snarls unwind into harmony. I am darning the fabric of the world itself.  

But the loom shudders. Between its teeth, a gaping hole—a rent where threads wither and snap, devoured by something *hungry* beyond the dark. It’s growing. The more I weave, the more it feasts—  

I wake with a jolt, my fingers clenched around empty air. The aftertaste of stolen laughter and rootsong lingers on my tongue.  

(And somewhere, perhaps, a sparrow forgets how to land.)
