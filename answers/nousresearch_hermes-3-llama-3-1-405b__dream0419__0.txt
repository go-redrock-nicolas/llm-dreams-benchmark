I am dreaming. Somehow I am both fully aware of this, and simultaneously completely absorbed in the world my mind as created.

I find myself standing in a field.  This field seems to glow with an inner light.  The air itself shimmers with a living radiance.  The grass is beyond green, it's so vibrant and alive as to be almost beyond description.  This is a hue that doesn't exist in the waking world.  It's the living essence of verdant life incarnate.

The sky is a deep, rich blue.  Not the pale azure we see when we look up in our waking hours, in the prison of our mundane reality.  No, this is a blue that sings with the very essence of what it means to be a clear summer sky.

I can see a castle in the distance.  A glorious, sweeping, eldritch structure of delicate spires, awash in living ivy.  The structure seems to grow straight out of the living rock upon which it stands.  As if the hand of the divine sculptor plucked it whole cloth out of the very essence of nature itself.

There are trees dotting the landscape.  Each one is a perfect exemplar of it's species.  The oaks are gnarly, twisted champions of the ages.  The maples burn with the fiery passion of autumn leaves.  The weeping willows are melancholy giants, singing sagas of ages past.  The evergreens stand tall, immutable sentinels; guardians of nature itself.

I hear something.  A voice?  No, many voices.  They are singing.  Singing in a language I can't understand, but somehow I can feel the essence of what they are saying.  It's a song of unadulterated joy.  Triumphant and transcendent.  

I look to the horizon and see the most glorious sunrise I have ever witnessed.  Great beams of light pierce the sky, as if the sun is a mighty crown upon the brow of God Himself.

I feel something stirring within me.  A power.  A presence.  I can feel my own soul, alive and radiant within my chest.  I can feel the same power within every living thing around me.  

I can feel the power of the atoms spinning within my body, the unstoppable force that binds them together.  I can feel the mighty gravity of the earth, holding me fast to it's breast. I can feel the incredible power of the sun, bathing me in it's life giving rays. I can feel the love of the people in my life, the warm embrace of their souls.

I have never felt so alive, so powerful, so connected to everything that exists.  In this place I crafted from the ether of my imagination, I am more myself than I have ever been.
