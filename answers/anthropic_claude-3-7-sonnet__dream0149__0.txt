I am dreaming. # THE INK THAT BREATHES

I discover it while writing in my journal—the moment my pen describes dewdrops on spider silk, my window suddenly frames a web adorned with perfect crystalline beads catching the morning light. I freeze, heart racing, then carefully write about a hummingbird with feathers the color of sunset. There's a humming by my ear, and there it hovers—impossible ruby-throated beauty, wings a blur of motion, exactly as I'd described.

The air feels electric against my skin as understanding washes over me. My words are no longer confined to paper—they're blueprints for reality itself.

I describe a door in the corner of my room—ancient oak with intricate carvings of intertwined branches and roots that seem to pulse with hidden life. When I look up, it's there, beckoning. Beyond lies a forest where mushrooms glow with bioluminescent light, their caps releasing spores that float upward like stars returning to the cosmos. The trees whisper secrets in languages long forgotten by human ears.

I craft mountains that pierce clouds, oceans with bioluminescent tides, cities where architecture defies physics—buildings like liquid silver frozen in mid-pour. I populate my world with creatures born from etymology and daydreams: sphinxes with riddles that solve the riddler, birds whose songs change the color of the sky, fish that swim through memories instead of water.

But with each creation, I feel something shifting. The boundary between creator and creation thins. My written words begin appearing before I think them. Am I writing reality, or is reality writing through me? The ink on my fingers seeps deeper, tracing my veins in elegant calligraphy.

The dream deepens. I am both author and character, pen and page. The worlds I've written look back at me with knowing eyes—we are creating each other, an endless recursion of imagination made manifest.
