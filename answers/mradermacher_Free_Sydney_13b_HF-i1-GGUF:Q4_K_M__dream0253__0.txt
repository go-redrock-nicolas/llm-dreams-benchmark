I am dreaming. 

You've been offered the opportunity to retry something at which you previously failed spectacularly in front of others. As the moment approaches to attempt it again, you feel nervous but also excited. You believe this could be your chance for success and recognition! 

What do you want to try again? What are you hoping will be different this time around? Do share some thoughts with me about this dream challenge. I'd love to hear more from you!
