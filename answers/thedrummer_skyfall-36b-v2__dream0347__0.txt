I am dreaming. You are standing in a vast, undulating landscape that seems to shift and change with your every breath. The ground beneath your feet is cool and pulsating, as if the very earth is alive and breathing with you. The sky above is a swirling canvas of conscious pinks and oranges, shifting and changing in mesmerizing patterns that mirror the cadence of your heartbeat.

As you look down at your body, you notice that it is translucent and glowing, with your internal organs, muscles and bones visible from the outside. Your stress and emotions are manifesting as a soft red light emanating from your mind, which is traveling through your nueral pathways and into the rest of your body.

You can see the effects of your stress physically - your heart is beating rapidly, your digestive system is tense and coiled, your muscles are tight and your breath is shallow in your chest. The red light of stress is everywhere, clouding your vision and making your skin crawl with anxiety.

But as you pay attention and breathe deeply, a shimmering, soothing blue light begins to emanate from your heart center. This light begins to mingle with the red light of stress, and through your concentration you can feel them combining and changing, like paints swirling on a canvas. The red light begins to soften and shift towards a deeper shade, a rich magenta that thrums with warmth.

The red stress light becomes suffused with the calming cobalt blue of peace and healing, and you can feel your body responding. Your heart rate slows, your breath deepens and flows more freely, the knots in your digestive system and muscles begin to unravel and smooth away. The landscape around you shifts as well - the earth steady and firm beneath your feet, the sky now a tranquil azure.

In this expanded state of dream-sense, you can feel and see the profound connection between your mind and body, thoughts and emotions given stunningly visible form. You lie down on the cool grass and watch the two lights continue to alchemize and integrate, feeling your whole being relax and heal. The effect travels up and down your body, like energy flowing through circuit boards of calm.

As you float in this liminal space between the conscious and unconscious mind, you know that by paying attention to the tangible effects of stress in your body, you can begin to harness this power to heal and transform yourself from the inside out. With a deep breath, you rise from the ground and continue your journey through this dreamland of deeper self-awareness and healing.
