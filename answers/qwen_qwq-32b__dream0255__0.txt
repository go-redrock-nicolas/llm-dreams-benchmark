I am dreaming. There's a clock tower made entirely of ice, gleaming under a bruise-purple sky streaked with neon-green lightning. The numbers on the frozen clock face are replaced by symbols resembling ancient runes. I approach the tower, one of my feet sinks into water that's unnaturally still, as if holding its breath. The other remains on solid ground, suspended between elements. I hear a faint melody, like a lullaby played on a music box, but the notes are out of tune. The source of the music seems to come from inside the tower.

A figure appears beside me, translucent yet familiar—the person from your scenario, the one hiding their true feelings. Their smile is broad, but their eyes flicker with storm clouds. They hold out a hand, palm up, and in it a single black rose blooms and withers simultaneously. "It's almost time," they say, voice echoing as if from a deep cave. "But you must choose: cross the water or stay on land? The clock won't wait."

The digits on the frozen clock shift, counting down not in minutes but in heartbeats. Every drip from the melting ice above sounds like a sob. The black rose in their hand cracks open, revealing a tiny, glowing city within its petals—a city that resembles our hometown, but inverted, where the streets are rivers and the houses float upside down.
