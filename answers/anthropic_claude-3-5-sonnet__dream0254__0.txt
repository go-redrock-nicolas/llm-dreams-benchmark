I am dreaming. Clouds of heavy indigo mist swirl around as my friend Sarah sits across from me in what seems to be an endless library, books floating by like autumn leaves caught in a gentle breeze. The wooden table between us keeps morphing, stretching and contracting like a living thing breathing. The air feels thick with unspoken words.

Sarah's face appears to shift between youth and age, her eyes holding an ancient sadness I've never noticed before. When she finally speaks, her voice echoes as if coming from deep underwater, rippling through the space between us. Tears fall from her eyes, but they float upward instead of down, forming crystalline constellations above her head.

She reveals the truth - she's been living two lives, existing in parallel timelines, and in the other reality, I died five years ago. She's been carrying the weight of my death while interacting with this version of me, knowing that somewhere in the multiverse, she failed to save me. The guilt has been consuming her, fracturing her sense of reality.

As she breaks down, the library around us begins to crumble like wet paper, books melting into streams of letters that rain down in luminescent ribbons. I reach for her hand across the table, but my fingers pass through hers like smoke. The devastating knowledge of my alternate fate creates a vacuum between us, pulling at the edges of everything we thought we knew about our friendship.

The dream pulses with waves of deep purple emotion, and I can physically feel her years of hidden grief washing over me like tide after tide of warm, heavy water. In this moment, we're both drowning in the complexity of existence, struggling to reconcile the multiple versions of our shared story...
