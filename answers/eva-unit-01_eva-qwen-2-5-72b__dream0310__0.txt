I am dreaming. In a warm, dimly lit place, the scent of incense fills the air with an almost palpable intensity, mingling with the rich hues of ancient tapestries adorning the walls. 

As an outsider to this sacred tradition, I feel a deep sense of respect and humility wash over me. In front of me, ornately designed ceremonial clothes lie waiting on a stone altar. Slowly, I begin to don the attire with careful deliberateness, as if sensing the profound significance of every fold and ornament. I can feel the weight of the attire as if it were woven with the stories of countless devotees who wore it before.

As I step towards others taking part in the ceremony, our voices rise and fall in a melodic chant, the words ancient and filled with a wisdom beyond my understanding. I may not grasp their literal meaning, but I can distinctly feel the unity and connectivity we share in this sacred space, bound by an invisible thread of faith and tradition.

The rhythmic beats of drums fill the air, resonating deep within my core. It is as though the very essence of this place, these people, their beliefs and rituals, are all harmoniously entwining into a singular, coherent pulse.

And as the chants grow louder and the drums pick up pace, I find myself moved in a way I had not anticipated â€“ with a profound sense of connection, peace, and understanding that transcends language and cultural boundaries.

I am dreaming...
