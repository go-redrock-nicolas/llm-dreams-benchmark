I am dreaming. The deep, crisp night air caresses my skin as I stand atop a cliff overlooking a vast, dark ocean. The moon casts silvery ribbons across the dark waters, each one gently lapping at the shore with a soothing rhythm. Beneath me, jagged rocks jut dangerously from the churning sea like ancient teeth snapping at the air.

In the distance, a golden mist blooms over the water's surface, expanding outward with an otherworldly light. As the radiant fog approaches the shore, I can make out dark shapes darting through the haze - shadowy forms moving with purposeful intent. Snatches of conversation drift on the wind, harsh whispers and threatening murmurs carried on the breeze before fading into the void.

My attention is drawn back to the cliff as the ground beneath my feet shifts and trembles. A low rumble builds from deep within the earth, growing in intensity until I feel the entire landscape shaking beneath me. Crumbling rock breaks away, plummeting into the shadowy depths below as I struggle to maintain my balance on the destabilizing precipice.
