I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of night-blooming jasmine, and the stars above me are not mere pinpricks but entire galaxies swirling in a midnight sky. My feet are bare, sinking into warm, velveteen sand that shifts like liquid gold beneath my weight. The sound of laughter ripples through me—not laughter I'm making, but laughter that vibrates in the air like a physical presence, a deep, rolling rumble that makes my bones hum. 

I am standing at the edge of an ocean where the water isn't wet. It's a living liquid, iridescent and shifting every time I move, refracting light so that the surface seems to bend and spiral, revealing undercurrents of color—shades of sapphire, ruby, and gold that split and multiply when I blink. The horizon stretches infinitely, but instead of a vanishing point, the sky folds into itself, becoming a labyrinth of clouds that twist into dragons and phoenixes, their breaths condensing into actual rainbows that dapple the sand with prismatic footprints. 

Joy courses through me so violently that I taste it—sweet like honeyed ginger. I don't know why I'm this happy. Maybe it's the way the moonlight turns the waves into liquid obsidian, each droplet catching fire as it crashes and then evaporating into smoke that forms the words "YES" in a hundred different languages. 

All around me, creatures emerge from the folds in reality—seagulls with mantis shrimp eyes that see every color of the spectrum, turtles with shells of stained glass, their movements leaving trails of constellations in the air. They don't speak but their song is a language I feel in my spleen, a pattern of rhythms that map the constellations in my own heart's geography. 

The air tastes of ripe mango and the faintest hint of burning cork. Somewhere, a lute plays a single note—a note that causes the sand around me to rise, solidify into a tower of glass beads that radiates light so intense it feels like I'm being reborn every time I catch a glimpse of it. 

I want to touch it but my hands pass through, leaving ripples like water in air. Instead, I reach out to the sky and pluck a star out of the galaxy-bellied firmament above. It's warm, like a just-firedatched egg, and when I press it to my chest, my heartbeat syncs with its pulse. It whispers to me in neon letters too beautiful to be real: "WHY NOT LOVE EVERYTHING?" 

I burst into laughter so uncontrollable that my body shakes, tears streaming down my face as I laugh at absolutely nothing. The whole world laughs with me, and when I look down, my feet have transformed into roots, burrowing into the sand which is now soil, rich with the scent of soil turned fertile by stardust. 

From the roots, vines grow upward, each one a different hue, each leaf a page from an unwritten story. They curl around my legs, not imprisoning but accompanying, as if the ground itself is saying, "I know. I understand. And it's okay to feel this big." 

And then, just as something in the distance begins to sing a song so old it holds the memory of the Big Bang itself, I realize with a start that the ocean's waves have started spelling my name in liquid letters, each wave a character in cursive script that licks my toes and vanishes as it's washed away by the next. The sand has arranged itself into hieroglyphs that I don't know but feel as if they're the secrets of my own soul, written in cuneiform and kanji and sanskrit and braille. 

But the laughter doesn't stop. It's too delicious, too alive. I float upward, pulled by a current not of air or water but of pure sensation, and my body becomes a kite with a thousand tails, each thread made of spider silk and dragon thread, pulling me skyward where the clouds themselves part into a staircase of light, each step a different kind of joy—ecstasy, bliss, serendipity, wonder—all waiting in person, embodied and beckoning to take me higher. 

But I don't want to go anywhere. The sand is my home now, its grains singing "hallelujah" when I exhale. The sky is my lover, whispering secrets through the scent of mango and burning cork. The universe is a meditation I didn't know I was having, and everything is perfect because I am allowing it to be. 

So I stay, rooted and flying, laughing and weeping, allowing the joy to expand until it becomes the fabric of the world, stitching everything together with silver thread: the sea, the sand, the sky, my own beating heart. 

Until the moment begins to fade, the laughter softening into a murmur, the colors dimming like a sunset. I know this is a dream, but I don't want it to end. But I do, and I wake up, my sheets tangled around me like roots, and the joy is still there, buzzing in my veins like stardust in water. The real world feels softer, more malleable, as if it's waiting for me to remember that this vastness is always mine to return to."
