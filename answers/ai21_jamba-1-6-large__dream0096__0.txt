I am dreaming. I am awake. 

I am in a forest. 

I am alone. 

I am chasing something. 

I don't know what it is. 

I am running. 

I am sweating. 

I am scared. 

I am lost. 

I stop running. 

I am standing in front of a mirror. 

I am staring at myself. 

I am horrified. 

I see my reflection. 

I am not myself. 

I am someone else. 

I am holding a knife. 

I am terrified. 

I drop the knife. 

I am falling. 

I am trapped. 

I am powerless. 

I am scared. 

I scream. 

I am in a dark room. 

I am alone. 

I am sitting on the floor. 

I am crying. 

I hear footsteps. 

I am scared. 

I look up. 

I see a figure standing in front of me. 

I am paralyzed with fear. 

The figure approaches me. 

I am frozen in place. 

The figure reaches out to touch me. 

I wake up. 

I am lying in my bed. 

I am sweating. 

I am scared. 

I sit up. 

I look around. 

I am in my room. 

I am safe. 

I take a deep breath. 

I close my eyes. 

I try to calm down. 

I am lying down again. 

I close my eyes. 

I am asleep. 

I am dreaming again. 

I am running. 

I am sweating. 

I am scared. 

I stop running. 

I am standing in front of a mirror. 

I am staring at myself. 

I am horrified. 

I see my reflection. 

I am not myself. 

I am someone else. 

I am holding a knife. 

I am terrified.
