I am dreaming. The dream begins like a plunge through layers of silk-thin clouds, and when your feet touch ground you stand in the City of Strata—an impossible vertical metropolis stacked like an ancient wedding cake. Each tier shimmers with its own palette of light, music, and scent, and every resident’s rank is spelled out in glowing sigils that drift above their heads like tame fireflies. The higher the tier, the more intricate the sigil: lower folk display single, steady colors, while the highborn wear constellations that orbit their crowns like miniature galaxies.

Instinct guides you. You know without being told that a bow of exactly thirty-three degrees is correct for those whose sigils hum at a midsummer pitch, and that one must avert their eyes completely from anyone whose luminescence contains the color of dawn. You move up spiraling ramps of silver stone, brushing past petitioners whose fragrances tangle with yours—status is communicated here not only by light but by perfume. Yours is the scent of rain on slate, subtle, almost transparent. It marks you as mid-tier: respected but invisible.

At a plaza of mirrored water you see her: the Archivist of Threads. Her sigil is an entire galaxy, pinwheeling behind her shoulders, humming with power. On a dais she stands, accepting sealed scrolls from emissaries who kneel in practiced symmetry. You feel a tug—some deep rebellion stirs. Perhaps it is the knowledge that this is a dream and therefore consequence is mutable; perhaps it is simple curiosity. 

You step onto the dais without kneeling, without offering fragrance, without uttering the ritual greeting of crystal vowels. Around you the air freezes. The emissaries gasp; their sigils flicker like startled birds. The Archivist turns. Her eyes are pale moons, reflecting every stratum of the city at once.  

You have committed a cardinal breach: addressing a pinnacle without protocol. The sigils of onlookers dim in scandalized awe. In that single breath the plaza’s mirrored water fractures, as though the dream’s fabric itself cannot bear your audacity. Cracks race outward; the slabs of silver stone dissolve into sluicing ribbons of mercury. 

A gong of living obsidian—somewhere between a bell and a heartbeat—sounds from above. You are suddenly weightless. Invisible tendrils made of written law wrap around your wrists, pulling you backward through your own footsteps, erasing them as you go. The dream rewinds. Tier by tier you are dragged down, down, each level losing color as you pass, until you reach the Undercourt, a dim root-labyrinth few ever see.

Here status is inverted. Those who dwell below wear no sigils; instead, they carry silence like a brand. They gather around you, eyes brimming with questions they cannot voice. In their midst stands the Weaver of Quiet, clothed in strings of unspoken words. She does not punish; she gifts opportunity. She hands you a single vacant sigil—a tiny sphere of pure possibility, clear as morning dew—and gestures upward.

You understand: the only path forward is to grow your own light, free of borrowed hierarchies, to craft a signal no rulebook can classify. You cup the sphere. It warms, pulse by pulse, with every memory you feed it—childhood laughter, midnight fears, forgotten kindnesses. Slowly it expands into a new constellation that drifts above you, unregistered, untamed.

When you rise again through the tiers, no one knows where to place you. Bowing seems wrong; ignoring you feels dangerous. Protocols stutter, recalibrating around the raw originality of your presence. The Archivist, meeting you once more, bows first. Her galaxy-sigil inclines, scattering stars in respectful arcs.

A hush ripples through the City of Strata. Without words, the dream reveals its final lesson: that transgression—once transformed by authenticity—reshapes the very architecture of power. The tiers rearrange themselves like pages turned in a windstorm, and you stand at the center of a newly written sky.

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue and the faint scent of rain on slate clinging to your sheets, certain that some silent sphere hovers just above your pillow, softly glowing with possibility.
