I am dreaming. I perceive the ethereal form of my two closest companions entangled in an atmosphere thickened by discord and disarray. The angry tones of their voices resonate, a harsh counterpoint to the melodic susurrus of the night breeze stroking the earth. 

My friends' eyes, once radiating warmth and affection, now bristle with resentment, and hard jagged words spill between them. The mounting tension permeates the dreamscape, and I feel its weight pressing heavily upon my chest.

Suddenly, both pairs of eyes fix on me, their gazes biting and filled with an expectant urgency. The silence that envelops us is potent, stifling. In this dreamscape, I comprehend that the harmony that once bound us has now been cast adrift upon a sea of misunderstandings and hurtful remarks.  

As I awaken from this vivid dream, I am seized by a profound feeling of unease, hoping that the ties that bind our friendships in the waking world will not suffer the same fate.
