I am dreaming. I'm dreaming...

In this vivid dreamscape, I find myself standing in a vast, eerily silent chamber. The walls and floor are made of a strange, pulsating obsidian that seems to drink in the dim light surrounding me. A warm, glowing mist swells around my feet, casting twisted shadows across the polished surface beneath.

Before me stretches an impossibly long corridor, its edges dissolving into the haze. At its far end, barely visible, stands a towering figure cloaked in writhing shadows. The oppressive weight of their gaze presses upon me.

As I awaken in my bedroom, the first rays of dawn lightening the sky, the crushing burden of my responsibilities crashes back down upon me. The deadline looms closer with every breath, each passing moment a painful reminder of my procrastination and the consequences that await my failure to act.
