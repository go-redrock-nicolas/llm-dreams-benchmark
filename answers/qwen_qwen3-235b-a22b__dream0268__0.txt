I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burning sage and wet parchment. You stand in a vast, shifting library, its shelves stretching into a sky that flickers between twilight and dawn. Books float like lanterns, their pages fluttering like trapped moths, but when you reach for one, the words dissolve into ink-black crows that scatter into the void. A low hum pulses beneath your feet—a sound like memory itself unraveling.  

You’re searching for *the moment*. The one everyone argues about. The one that fractured the timeline. But your mind is a mosaic of half-truths. You see flashes: a red door left ajar, a voice whispering in a language of smoke, a hand clutching yours in the dark—was it yours? Someone else’s? The fragments refuse to align.  

A figure materializes at the end of the aisle—a childhood friend, or perhaps a stranger. Their face shifts like water, features melting between familiarity and alienation. “You were *there*,” they say, their voice echoing from the walls. “You saw what happened. Why do you lie?”  

“I don’t remember,” you plead, but your throat fills with static.  

“Memory is a betrayal,” another voice replies. A woman steps from the shadows, her skin etched with constellations that move as she breathes. She holds a mirror made of liquid mercury. “They’ve rewritten it. Stolen the edges. Look.”  

The mirror shows a scene you don’t recognize: a banquet hall with tables groaning under rotting feasts, faces blurred like smudged charcoal. Laughter echoes, sharp and hollow. You see yourself at the head of the table, smiling, but your hands are stained with something that glows faintly blue. “This isn’t real,” you whisper.  

“It’s more real than your version,” the woman replies, and the mirror cracks, shards falling upward into the air like ascending stars.  

Suddenly, the library tilts. Shelves fold into staircases spiraling into the earth, into oceans, into rooms you’ve never seen but feel you’ve lived in. A clockwork bird alights on your shoulder, its gears grinding. “The truth is buried in the third echo,” it chitters, then flies toward a door made of teeth.  

You follow, but the floor becomes quicksand, swallowing your ankles in memories you didn’t know you had: a lullaby sung backward, a funeral where everyone dances, a kiss that tasted of iron. When you finally wrench free, you’re standing in a field of static, like a TV screen with no signal.  

A crowd materializes, their backs turned to you. They chant a story in unison—a version of the event where you are the villain, the hero, the ghost. “This is how it happened,” they insist. But you feel it, deep in your marrow: they’re wrong. All of them.  

Then, silence.  

The static clears. Before you stands a child holding a key made of bone. Their eyes are your eyes. “You forgot,” they say softly, “because remembering would break you.” They press the key into your palm, and the dream begins to burn.  

You wake up screaming, clutching a single phrase from the flames: *The pact was never broken. It was never yours to make.*
