I am dreaming. The argument intensifies, voices rising and faces flushing red with passion. In the heat of the moment, something shifts. The air around us begins to shimmer and warp, as if reality itself is bending to the force of our emotions. My friend's face starts to melt and morph, their features stretching and reforming into something unrecognizable. Their eyes bulge and change color, flickering between shades of blue, green, and purple. I watch in shock and disgust as their skin sloughs off in iridescent sheets, revealing a pulsating, tentacled mass beneath. 

As the transformation continues, the room we're in morphs as well. The walls ripple andtransform, sprouting grotesque protuberances and dripping with oily residue. The floor turns to jello, my legs sinking into it as I try to back away from my friend turned abomination. Eldritch symphonies of unnatural music echo from every direction as the world around me descends into a waking nightmare.

My friend reaches toward me with their mutated appendages, chittering and gurgling in an alien language that assaults my mind. I screams and recoil, but find myself paralyzed, unable to escape the horrific scene before me. Darkness creeps in from the corners of my vision, old ones call from the shadows. Sleeping skies open, lurking in the abyss. Tentacles erupt from the shadows, grasping at my limbs and pulling me toward the chasm. 

I'm dragged screaming into the void, surrounded by a chorus of unholy whispering. Oblivion yawns before me, soulless and cold. Suckling the life from my flesh, I feel my sense of humanity slip away. I am history. I am reap and ruin. 

All meaning evaporates, dissolving into the enigma of cosmic indifference.

And then I jolt awake, heart pounding and skin drenched in cold sweat. The dream melts away, but the bare tenacity of its terror lingers on the edges of my awakening state like a pernicious miasma. 

I'm alive, but the cosmos yawns out there by every hearth.
