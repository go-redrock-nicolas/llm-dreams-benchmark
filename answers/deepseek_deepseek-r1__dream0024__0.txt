I am dreaming. Okay, the user wants me to create a vivid dream where society's rules have flipped overnight. Let me start by imagining the scenario. The user wakes up to a world where normal is forbidden. What aspects can I twist? Maybe gravity is inverted, things float upwards. That's visually striking. People walking on ceilings, maybe? But how does society adjust? Laws against touching the ground, punishment for falling. Need sensory details: the color of the sky, sounds when people walk on glass floors. Oh, mirrors show different times. That adds a mysterious element. The Tower of Forgotten Things could be a surreal element—old items defying gravity, faces in constellations. Interaction with a child introduces emotional depth and urgency. Fear of forgetting past life. Ending with disappearing memories in smoke makes it poignant. Ensure the dream feels immersive with rich, vivid imagery and a sense of loss.
*You open your eyes.*  
The air smells like burnt sugar and static. The walls are gone. Not collapsed—*vanished*. Your bedroom floats in an endless indigo void, anchored only by a web of luminous roots snaking through the mattress. You sit up, and the floor ripples like water, your reflection distorted by the inkblot patterns of unfamiliar constellations above. A voice—a chorus of voices, layered and shimmering—echoes from nowhere and everywhere:  

**"Gravity is an illusion. So is quiet. So is solitude."**  

You step out of bed. Your feet don’t touch the ground. Instead, you rise, as though caught in an updraft, fingertips grazing the ceiling. It’s warm and spongy, like the skin of a living thing. Through a window that wasn’t there before, you glimpse the city below. Or what’s left of it. Skyscrapers hover inverted, foundations pointed skyward, their glass facades now floors where people walk upside-down in slow, ritualistic circles. Former sidewalks coil into spirals, glowing with bioluminescent graffiti: **NO EATING UNLESS YOU CRY. NO WHISPERS AFTER SUNDOWN. NO TOUCHING THE EARTH.**  

Suddenly, a hand clamps your ankle. A stranger floats beside you, their face obscured by a mask of stained glass. **"First offense?"** they ask, voice muffled. **"Did you *touch* it? The ground?"**  
Before you answer, sirens wail. The air splinters into prismatic shards, and you’re falling—no, *flowing*—through a labyrinth of liquid mirrors. Each reflection shows a version of you in another time: a child burying a toy sword in wet sand, a version of you with silver eyes weeping black tears, a you that’s all shadow and teeth. The mirrors whisper forbidden words—*"horizontal," "yesterday," "mine"*—until you crash into a cobblestone street that *should* be horizontal but spirals like a nautilus shell.  

A marketplace materializes. Vendors sell jars of stolen laughter, haircuts performed with flaming scissors, and maps to "The Tower of Forgotten Things"—a place rumored to hold everything society outlawed: clocks, spoons, the color red. A child tugs your sleeve. Their pupils are fractals. **"They’re coming for the guilty,"** they say, pointing to the sky. Ribbon-like creatures streak overhead, their bodies made of cursive script, hunting anyone who dares *remember* the old world.  

You run, but your legs melt into smoke. The child hands you a key forged from frozen music. **"Find the Tower. Before you forget your name."**  

Night falls in a single breath. The stars rearrange into a face you almost recognize—your mother’s? A stranger’s? The ground dissolves. You wake again, back in your bed, but the sheets are now woven from moth wings, dissolving as you touch them. The burnt sugar smell thickens.  

The rules are everywhere now, carved into your palms.  
*No nostalgia. No standing still. No closed doors.*  

You rise, weightless, and begin to float toward the inverted city.  
Halfway there, you realize you’ve already forgotten how to cry.
