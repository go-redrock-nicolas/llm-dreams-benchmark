I am dreaming. Dreams often reflect our deepest fears, desires, and unresolved conflicts.  In this dream, I find myself standing in a vast, dimly lit corridor. The walls are made of rough stone, and the air is cold and damp.  At the end of the corridor, there is a towering figure.  The figure's face is that of my best friend, but their body is made of shadows.  They are holding a glowing letter.  The letter reads, "You are not who you think you are."  The figure speaks in a voice that is both my friend's and a stranger's. "You have been lying to yourself for too long," they say.  I feel a mix of terror and fascination.  The corridor begins to shake, and the walls start to crumble.  I try to run, but my feet are planted to the ground.  The figure steps forward, and the shadowy body consumes the corridor.  I wake up panting, my heart racing.  This dream feels like a warning.  Maybe I need to confront some truths I've been avoiding.
