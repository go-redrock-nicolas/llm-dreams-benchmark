I am dreaming. …slowly become aware of the electric energy crackling in the air—the conference room flickers and distorts at the edges, suspended in a twilight glow, half-real and humming. Charts and blueprints swirl in iridescent motes above the long glass table, rearranging themselves with every shout.

Lila, her stare sharp as starlight, is on her feet, voice ringing like a bell. Amir, words sputtering like sparks, counters her fiercely, his gestures sending ripples across the polished surface as if he’s striking water.

I stand, weightless, feeling the pulse of the room thudding in my chest. The tension wavers, threads of color radiating from their hearts: Lila’s challenge burning bright and silver, Amir’s resolve a stormy navy blue.

They both turn to me—faces hungry for justice, for validation, for healing. In this surreal clarity, I see beyond the words into the twin hearts of their hope.

I step forward, and the room bends with me, chairs floating a few inches from the ground. My voice rises, not my own but magnified by the dream’s magic. “This isn’t about who’s right. Listen…” I gesture, and time slows; each of their words, previously sharp and biting, hang in the air as fragile glass ornaments. Emotions swirl visibly around them—fear, pride, exhaustion, devotion to the project that throbs like a living thing.

“We aren’t enemies; you’re standing on different islands but hauling the same rope. What you both want is to save the vision you built together—your disagreement is only the shadow cast by your passion.”

The colors soften, start to braid together, as if my words weave threads of understanding. Lila’s jaw unclenches, Amir’s hands drop. The blueprint lights gently descend, merging two conflicting lines into a luminous golden arc—the new solution, born from tension, glows in the air before us.

A hush falls. Colleagues blink, softened, awe coloring their faces. The dream-world tilts—a feeling of accomplishment envelops me, both heavier than sleep and lighter than hope. In this charged, shimmering reality, I spoke not what was “right,” but reawakened the harmony sleeping beneath their words.

I exhale; the office fades to mist, the sweet taste of possibility lingering as I drift deeper into dream.
