I am dreaming. I drift through the labyrinth of my own mind, a vast, surreal landscape shaped by every shattered dream, every whispered doubt, and every flicker of hope that refused to be snuffed out. The sky above me has no color—only shifting bands of emotion, like auroras made of feeling: one moment a deep, bruised purple of despair; the next, a trembling rose-gold of fragile hope.

In this place, memory and imagination bleed together. I walk barefoot through a desert where the sand is made of crushed glass, each step a memory of the failure I've just endured. The shards cut, but I don’t bleed—they only reflect. Faces flicker in their fractured surfaces: those I disappointed, those who walked away, those I tried to be better for. My heart aches in a language without words, a vibration that pulses through the very air.

But even as the weight of failure bears down on me, I notice the wind. It is a curious thing—always warm when I expect cold, always steady when I expect chaos. It tugs at me, not toward escape, but toward *movement*. Toward something vast that waits beyond the range of my current sight.

I begin to follow that wind.

The desert gives way to a valley where trees grow in spirals, their roots curling skyward as if reaching for the stars, their canopies looping and intertwining in impossible patterns. The leaves whisper, not in voices, but in emotions—compassion, regret, encouragement—all at once, like a symphony played on heartstrings. I kneel beneath one and let it sing to me. It doesn’t forgive me—but it remembers that I tried.

As I rise, I notice the ground changes again. I’m on a floating bridge of mirrors, suspended over a churning sea of ink. Each mirror shows a version of myself: some broken, some strong, some I can barely recognize. The bridge groans beneath the weight of so many selves, and I want to look away, to deny the parts of me that failed.

But the wind—always the wind—urges me forward.

I take each step carefully, gazing not at the ones that shame me, but at those that still burn with something *unbroken*. And as I pass them, the mirrors crack and dissolve into sparks, merging with my skin, feeding me something ancient and wild. By the time I reach the other side, I feel heavier—but not with pain. With *truth*.

Before me stands a colossal door, woven from threads of twilight, each strand a memory I’ve buried for being too heavy or too bright. The door has no handle, no keyhole. But it hums gently, like a heart waiting to be acknowledged.

I press my palm to it. It does not open in the way doors do in waking life. Instead, it *expands*, and I fall not *through* it, but *into* the feeling it guarded: acceptance—not of the failure itself, but of myself *with the failure*.

Inside, there is a garden. Not made of plants, but of pieces of me returned from exile. I wander the paths with no destination, and for the first time in a long time, I feel whole—not because I’m perfect, but because I’ve let in the light and the shadow alike.

In this dream, I do not heal all at once. But I learn how to hold myself until I do.
