I am dreaming. A vast expanse of silence stretches beneath me — not the absence of sound, but the swallowing of it, like the breath of reality has caught and does not release. I am falling through twilight: a sky neither day nor night, caught in the liminal marrow of transition. The air smells of old books, forgotten dreams, and extinguished stars.

The sensation of plummeting has no urgency now — it’s slow, deliberate, like falling through ink. My body doesn’t resist; it accepts. And as I descend, the stars swirl above like galaxies melting in honey, stretching into ribbons of forgotten time. A great weight presses on my chest — not fear now, but wonder — as the realization comes with stark clarity: **this has always been the end**.

I was driving. Memory stirs — the screech of metal, the sudden lurch, glass like snowflakes in the air. And then, that moment where the present stretches: heartbeats slowed, thoughts blooming into eternity. A near death. **My near death**. But now I am here — in **this place**, floating like a drowned thought, aware not just that I will die, but that I’ve been dying every second all along.

And what a paradox — this awareness doesn’t terrify. It glows, softly, like the dying light of lanterns in a city beneath the sea.

An island emerges from the dark below, suspended in the void. Spirals of green stone coil into towers; rivers whisper ancient names back to the mountains they’ve carved from memory. Trees grow upside down, roots clawing at the heavens, their leaves dripping translucent fire. The island breathes with me — a cold, serenely inhuman rhythm. It knows I am mortal, and it pities, but not cruelly.

A figure stands at the crest of the island — neither man nor woman, but something else: lithe, draped in folds of cloth that pulse like living skin. Its voice is not heard, but **felt**, as though my bones have always known it.

“**What is your fragility now?**”

I cannot speak, so I think, and the thought ripples outward:

> It is the truth that dare not live long in the sun, but only in the quiet hush before sleep. It is the ache of love knowing it cannot last. It is the trembling when I imagine a world without this thread of me braided into its chaos.

The figure tilts its head. The air shimmers, like heat off sunbaked stone, but far colder.

> “And do you hold this knowledge like coal or compass now?**

I touch the air between us.

> Like both.

The figure turns, walking into a tempest of swirling stone petals. The wind does not howl. It **remembers**. And I follow, drawn by a magnetism that feels less like fate and more like home.

The deeper we walk, the more visions blossom like starved memories now free.  
I see my mother as a child, chasing phosphorescent moths through a garden made of bones.  
I walk beside my older self, frail and radiant, laughing beside a quiet fire in a house where the windows open into other dreams.  
I lie on the beach of another planet, the sand mapping all the lives I might have lived.

Then, a moment of clarity like glass cracking across the chest: **everything I love, I will leave.**  

But now — **I want to feel it. All of it.** The ache, the terror, the fragile joy of beginnings and the poetry of endings.

Suddenly I wake—cot in a bare room, pale walls, the hum of some unplace like a hospital stitched between dimensions—but I'm still touched by the vision. I carry the island in my marrow now.

Reality does not seem so flat. My breath joins the greater chorus.

I am awake.  
But something elemental in me has changed.  
**I must live not as if I am immortal…**  
…but as if I loved every fragile second **as though I were already gone.**
