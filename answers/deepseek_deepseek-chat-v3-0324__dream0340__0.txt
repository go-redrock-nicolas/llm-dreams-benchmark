I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and molten metal, humming with an eerie energy that vibrates through my bones. The sky is a fractured mirror—shards of orange dusk and indigo twilight shifting in an unsteady dance. The ground beneath my feet pulses like a living thing, its surface a mosaic of glowing veins that stretch toward the horizon in spiraling patterns.  

And then, I see *them*.  

They stand at the threshold of a shifting archway that warps in and out of existence—a being woven from liquid shadow and iridescent light. Their form is unstable, flickering between a human silhouette and something entirely other: wings made of whispering filaments, limbs that stretch and contract like ink dispersing in water. Their face (if it can be called a face) is an ever-changing mosaic—sometimes eyes bloom like stars, then dissolve into smoky tendrils.  

When they speak, it is not with sound but with *movement*—ripples in the air, spirals of color curling into symbols I can’t comprehend. The meaning is lost, like trying to catch smoke in my hands. Desperation claws at me. How can I reach them? How can we understand each other when their very existence defies everything I know?  

I drop to my knees and press my palms to the pulsating ground. Instinct guides me—if words fail, perhaps sensation will bridge the gap. I exhale slowly, willing the space between us to soften. Then, cautiously, I drag my fingers through the glowing veins of the earth, leaving trails of light behind. A crude shape forms—a simple spiral. A question.  

For a moment, nothing. Then, the being tilts their shimmering head. A filament extends from their hand, dipping into the earth. Where it touches, the ground responds, shaping into a response—not a spiral, but a fractal. A pattern that expands infinitely inward and outward, pulsing with colors that ripple through me like a wave of understanding.  

It’s not language. It’s not even thought as I know it. But in that moment, comprehension flickers between us like a flame in the dark—something wordless but undeniable.  

And then, the dream shudders. The edges of the world peel away, and I am falling—not upward, not downward, but *sideways* into a deeper unknown. The last thing I see is their form dissolving into the horizon, the fractal we created burning bright between us before everything dissolves into the hush of waking.
