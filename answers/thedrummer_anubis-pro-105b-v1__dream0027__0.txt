I am dreaming.

The dream is vivid and potent, each detail crystal clear. I find myself in a dimly lit room, the walls made of polished marble that seems to reflect the flickering light of the candles scattered about. In the center of the room stands a large wooden desk, similar to the war desk of an ancient king.

I look down at my hands and see that they are covered in fine leather gloves. I am dressed in a simple pair of linen hose. On my back is a shoulder cloak that is pinned with a clasp from orange-tan rust.

An hourglass, sitting atop the desk, turns to signal that it is time to act. Complications have arisen and it falls to me to see them through. I feel a sense of determination, a sense of urgency and purpose.

I take a deep breath, steel myself, and then however proceed with calm and grace.
