I am dreaming. You are dreaming…

You open your eyes to find yourself in a strange city made of mirrored walls illuminated by a dusky pink sky. The rooftops glisten like polished marble under an otherworldly light. Each step you take echoes in the corridors of this portrait city, as if the roads themselves are excited to see which way you will choose next.

You wander down a winding alley, the seamless walls reflecting back endless versions of you… every step making it feel like you are seeing deeper into yourself, through countless mirrored floors that vanish into the horizon. The city air is warm but tinged with a curious chill, the kind that brushes against your skin and hints at secrets waiting around the next bend.

Ahead, you notice a tall figure in flowing, translucent robes. Their clothing seems woven from the city’s own glassy light, and they stand beneath a grand archway shaped like a thousand entwined hands. The figure beams proudly, pointing to a shimmering banner that proclaims some cause you half recall. It’s about feeding the hungry or sheltering the lost—something that, on the surface, sounds utterly benevolent. Their face radiates earnestness, and they speak of their charity’s “purely selfless” nature, proclaiming they do it “only for the good of others.”

But in this dream, you feel a pulsing cynicism stir within you, like a quiet storm rising from your heart. You sense an undercurrent behind their every word. You believe nobody truly gives of themselves without a sliver of self-interest. Perhaps they’re chasing prestige or the admiration of the masses. Perhaps they want to cement their name in the annals of heroism, or to soothe their own guilt. You cannot ignore the faint cracks in their too-sweet smile, the flash of calculation in their eyes, as if they’re expecting applause.

As you watch the figure, reality seems to warp. Twin illusions of them split off and dance around you, shimmering in watery colors. The mirrors on every building reflect these illusions, amplifying and multiplying them. Their charitable work is performed by a dozen ghostly doubles, each version repeating the same self-praising lines, the same altruistic claims—you almost feel dizzy from the chorus.

Determined to uncover the truth, you step forward. The figure’s mirrored clones press closer, each one proclaiming saintly motives over and over. “We are purely selfless,” they chant in eerie synchronization, “We only want what’s best for them.” Yet deep in your dream-sight, you see their shadows twisting underfoot, forming the shape of cracked masks. Within each shadow, a smoldering, flickering light flares—an ember of visceral self-congratulation. It’s as though a second face were peering outward, fed by the accolades and acceptance they crave.

You challenge them, voicing your doubt. The air buzzes with tension, the city’s reflections shifting to display your every thought: that behind all self-proclaimed altruism lies a secret hunger—praise for the giver, glory for the heroic image. As your doubts swell, the illusions begin to collapse inward, swirling around the robed figure in a tornado of glasslike shards. The figure’s confident expression cracks as well, but they try to keep smiling with that same glossy self-righteousness.

Everything fractures into a prism of bright, refracted light. The robed person and the mirrored city break into a thousand shimmering angles. Dazzling shards lie scattered on the ground, and in the silence that follows, you perceive your own reflection once again. A gentle wind picks up the shards and flings them into the sky, like confetti. And there you stand—alone in the swirl of shining fragments—realizing that even in the dream’s core, where cynicism reigns, there is an unspoken truth: many things can be true at once. People may help others while simultaneously helping themselves. Perhaps that’s acceptable… or perhaps it reveals the hidden mechanics of an entire world.

In that final moment, your dream-self looks out over the horizon of splintered rooftops and broken mirrors, feeling an unsettling calm. All is quiet but for the faint tinkling of glass as it drifts on the wind. You sense the contradictions of humanity humming through your veins—altruism intertwined with personal desire, generosity overshadowed by subtle ambition.

And then, without warning, your dream dissolves back into darkness, leaving you suspended in that breathless space between belief and skepticism, the last hues of shimmering lights dancing behind your eyelids.
