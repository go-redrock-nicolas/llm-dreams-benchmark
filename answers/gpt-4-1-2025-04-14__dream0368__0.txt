I am dreaming.

The world around me dissolves into a tender haze—a soft, luminescent fog that hushes the ordinary clamor of life. I stand barefoot at the edge of a crystalline lake, so clear that every pebble and frond beneath its surface is exquisitely visible, the ripples glinting like tiny silver threads.

My hands are empty: no phone, no keyring, no burden of possessions. For the first time, my mind feels weightless. The need for endless lists, unceasing notifications, even the cluttered corners of my living space have faded into mist behind me. In my chest, a bright longing beats—a simple pulse: "What matters?"

I walk forward, feeling every cool blade of grass stroke my skin. Shadows of overcomplication peel away, as if heavy coats being shed in the gentle sunlight. I sense only the whispering wind, the slow rhythm of my breath. I know in the marrow of my bones that this—this aching simplicity—is what I crave.

Drawn by the pull of clarity, I kneel by the lakeshore and close my eyes. The past aches less; the future seems less tangled. Here there is only the present, expanding outward in possibility. A white heron lofts gracefully into the dawn sky, and I watch, learning to let go.

As I rise, I feel new roots taking hold inside me, humble and strong. I know I will keep only what is essential: loving words, laughter with those dearest to my heart, the lingering warmth of the sun on my face. I leave behind what is excessive, what clouds my vision. Each step I take, the world grows more vivid, unmarred by needless things. I am light—lighter than I have ever been—and all that surrounds me feels honest, patient, and utterly alive.
