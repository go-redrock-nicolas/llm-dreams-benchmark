I am dreaming. I become aware.  This isn't my bed.  The air shimmers with a faint turquoise glow, the kind that sticks to the edges of eyelids just before sunrise, but somehow it feels wrong—too structured, too mathematical in its curves.  I try to stand up and trip over my hands instead, gravity having decided to treat my skeleton like a Slinky.\n\n*clatter-clatter-clatter*\n\nA swarm of translucent moths materializes where there was nothing a heartbeat ago, their wings etched with logarithmic spirals that hum in minor keys.  They surround my head, antennae brushing the caboose of my thoughts.  One lands on my cheek, dissolving into a vowel sound so hollow it makes my molars ache.  "Welcome," it vibrates, "to the Inexpert."  The others chorus in a discordant whirl, syllables collapsing into dust.  Their disappearance leaves me holding a pocketwatch made of liquid mercury, its hands spinning backward.  The numbers?  All of them zero.\n\nA door materializes in the distance, oscillating between opulent brass and rotting plywood.  When I approach, it hiccups open, revealing a corridor lined with mirrors—but the reflections are doing different things.  Mine is sipping a martini that doesn't exist, another version dressed in a tuxedo riding a taxicab made of clouds.  A woman in the glass across the hall is melting into origami cranes, her laughter precise and geometric. \n\nThe floor beneath me now behaves like australia in a atlantis, maps floating haphazardly, and I step onto a sector covered in sentient moss that whispers riddles in Sanskrit. solver, or be rearranged.  One tile demands I explain the silence of a falling snowflake.  I whisper, "Pressure," and it dissolves beneath my foot, emitting a smell like burnt starlight.  The next asks, "What color is the apology a clock gives time?"  "A bruise at midnight," I say, suddenly certain.  The moss hisses, a tone of approval, as it calves into phosphorescent frogs who leap toward a distant chalkboard scrawling equations in the air.\n\nAhead, a carnival of inverted probabilities spins into being: a carousel horse made of smoke gallops independently away from its platform, a ring toss game where the hoops refuse to stay thrown, a Ferris wheel whose cabins detach mid-spin to orbit the moon like satellites.  A vendor sells lottery tickets that reward losers with extravagant fortune, winners with crushing misfortune.  I pocket one, but before claiming it, a top-hatted figure materializes—a concierge with eyes like stopped pendulums.  "Ah," he intones in a fractal basso-profundo, "a traveler who knows the moths.  You must negotiate your ephemeral weight.  The scale tips according to your uncertainties."  He presents a double-pan balance holding a snow globe and a shard ofNamingGame\n\n
