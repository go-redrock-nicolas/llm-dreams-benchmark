I am dreaming. I blink open my eyes to velvet black, scattered with shards of silver and deep violet nebulae. I am surrounded not by the walls of a room, but by the soft glow of a captain's bridge aboard a great warship of the stars—gleaming surfaces pulse with life, and softly clicking machines murmur around me.

The console at my hands resembles the bones of some ancient creature, stretching with grim intention toward infinity. I don’t remember how I got here. I don’t remember ever piloting a vessel—or really knowing what a neutron stabilizer is, for that matter—but the crew looks to me like I should.

A red indicator pulses. Thumps. Beats louder. My ship—what is its name? Memory floats like mist, but instinct grips me tight—a thread of familiarity I can pull. *The Lysander's Ghost.*

An eerie moniker, a sober truth. The ship drifts, power failing in uneven waves, as if something alive is gnawing at its vitals. I punch a console; no response. I glance at the helm officer, a tall being of liquid glass skin and a voice so musical it seems sung through reeds.

“Captain, graviton flux is spiking through our aft quadrant. Reactor overheat warning: amber and rising.”

Another figure—a small, skittering creature in an overlarge vacuum suit—scurries over from the engineering terminals, chittering, “We lossin’ containment, boss. Solar harpoon's entirely offline, and the—”

Everything stutters in the bridge’s glow. For a moment, lights wink out, and in the pause between heartbeats, I sense something... watching. Vast. Imprints pressing on my mind like fingerprints on wax.

We are not alone here, in this horizonless gulf.

"Hold your arcs tight," I say, my voice older than I remember. Confident. It's as if I've said this a thousand times, no memory of it.

I step out of the command chair, gravity shifting beneath me. The decks tilt not from movement, but from something deeper—something *fractured* in the ship’s core. The Lysander's Ghost doesn't just travel space. It dreams something older: things that should never have been built, and worse, never finished.

Down here, deep in the hull, you start *hearing* the ship hum differently.

“I'm going to the engine chamber,” I say. No time for debate. Not in dreams. The crew argues in fragments, half-formed protests that fade as a new darkness coils through the panels and badges lit red like bleeding eyes.

Sealed in a vacuum suit, I descend—and the architecture around me changes. It is no longer sleek, gleaming alloyed steel and plastiglass hatches, but something with ribs. With breath. The deeper I go, the more I feel like I'm walking through a throat, and that soon, I might meet the thing doing the swallowing.

In the heart of the Ghost, suspended in a cradle of tungsten-black plasma, the reactor waits—a tiny singularity held behind sacred geometry. Unstable. Hungry.

No crew. Just whispering interfaces. Myself. And **it**.

Pulsing in darkness, a phrase echoes not from the ship, or the console—but from somewhere deeper.

> **“Captain... I remember now.”**

And suddenly I do. Not all, but the edges. The final mission, buried deep in the dream drift, where we tried to *rescue* the sun that died in the Heraklion Veil, and only I dared to breach the crust of dead fire. Only I was willing to forget myself.

And now, even that shield is cracking.

The malfunction is not a flaw.

It is memory.

A door opens inside the reactor, or maybe inside me. Not made of alloy. Older hands grip the threshold.

The Lysander’s Ghost does not merely fly.

It *remembers.*

And now... it wants to go *back.*
