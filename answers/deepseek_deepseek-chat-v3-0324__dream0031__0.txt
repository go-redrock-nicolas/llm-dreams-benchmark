I am dreaming. On a crowded subway train.  The air is thick with the mingled scents of perfumes, fast food, and the faint metallic tang of the rails beneath us. Faces are illuminated by the glow of phones, some chatting, some lost in thought, all swaying gently with the rhythm of the moving train. Then—darkness. The lights flicker once, twice, and vanish completely. The train jerks to a halt, and the sudden stop sends a few people stumbling forward. A collective gasp rises, followed by nervous laughter.  

From the blackness, a whisper.  

At first, I think it's just someone nearby, but the whisper grows, winding its way through the air, weaving between the murmurs of alarmed passengers. It speaks in no language I recognize—something fluid, serpentine, almost melodic—but I understand it all the same.  

*"You are the only one awake here,"* it says.  

And then the flashlight from a phone clicks on—not from any real hand, but floating, disembodied, casting a dim glow across the train car. The beam sweeps across empty seats. The other passengers are gone. Or rather, they never existed. Their voices were part of the hum, the illusion of movement.  

The whisper rustles again, closer now. *"Step out."*  

A soft creak—the subway doors open. But beyond them isn’t the tunnel wall. Instead, there is an expanse of endless night, dotted with unfamiliar constellations, silver and swirling like ink dropped in water. A bridge of dark stone stretches forward, inviting and inevitable.  

I stand. The air is electric.  

And then—I take the first step.
