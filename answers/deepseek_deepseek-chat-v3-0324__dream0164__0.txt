I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Alchemist’s Touch**  

The world around you shimmers, not quite solid, as if you’ve slipped between the threads of reality. The air hums with latent possibility, whispering secrets of creation itself. You reach out, fingertips brushing the rough bark of a tree—except it isn’t just bark anymore. Beneath your touch, the cellulose softens, unravels, and rewrites itself. Wood becomes liquid gold, flowing like honey before solidifying into a twisted sculpture of anastomosing strands, precious and warm.  

Laughing in breathless delight, you kneel and press your palms to the earth. The soil trembles, grains of sand fusing and transforming—soon, a carpet of sapphires spreads under you, refracting the dream-light into cerulean fractals. A stone vaults into your grip—limestone, laden with ancient fossils. A thought, a pulse of will, and the calcium carbonate shifts. Bones stir within the rock, not mere imprints but living ivory. A dinosaur’s tooth elongates, gleams, and slides from the stone into your hand, still humming with primordial energy.  

You turn your gaze upward. The clouds hang heavy, swollen with rain. You **pinch** the air, and the water molecules obey—hydrogen and oxygen split, recombine, ignite. The sky blushes with auroras of controlled flame, ribbons of fire that curl and dance without burning, transforming into cascades of floating crystal, each facet singing with refracted starlight.  

Then—you see it. The moon, distant and cold. You **pull**, not with arms, but with the sheer gravity of your mind. Silver streams downward like liquid mercury, a shimmering bridge between the heavens and your outstretched hand. The metal pools in your palm, and with a philosopher’s grin, you whisper, *"Now… something new."* The atoms tremble, protons shifting in quantum surrender. The silver **twists**, becomes something never before seen—an iridescent metal, singing with a sound like chimes at the edge of the universe.  

You realize, with a thrill, that you are no longer shaping matter but **speaking to it**, and the cosmos is answering in riddles of light and song.  

Then—  

(Do you wake? Or do you reach deeper?)
