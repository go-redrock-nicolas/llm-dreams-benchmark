I am dreaming. …breathe in the shimmering air that tastes like sweet thunderclouds and stardust. All around you, the dreamscape hums with impossible colors—indigo that smells of wet cedar, gold that crackles like distant laughter, and a deep, velvety crimson that seems to pulse in time with the hidden heartbeat of the world.  

You stand on a slender bridge woven from moon-white spider-silk, suspended between twin cliffs of obsidian glass. Far below, an ocean of liquid aurora stretches to every horizon, its surface rippling with luminous waves that spell half-remembered lullabies in fluent light. Somewhere beyond that horizon, you think, lies the answer to every question you have ever asked yourself—but to reach it, you must choose your path now.

Before you, two doors hover in mid-air, each slowly rotating like medallions caught in a gentle current. The left door is crafted from ancient driftwood and etched with silver veins that glow and fade as if breathing. The right door is forged of hammered bronze, warm to the touch, exhaling scents of roasted chestnut and distant hearths. Both doors whisper your name in voices you once heard in childhood dreams—voices of friends you can no longer place, songs you can no longer hum.

The reward of opening either door is clear: revelation, a glimpse of your truest self, the key to a treasure you hadn’t realized you’d misplaced. Yet the risk trembles just beneath that promise. One door, perhaps, will rewrite your memory, scattering some cherished recollections like petals in a storm. The other might twist your future, reshaping all paths that lead back to waking life. The dream offers no clues—it only magnifies the throb of urgency in your chest.

A sudden breeze curls around you, carrying flecks of glowing pollen that settle on your skin, warming you with courage. High above, a flock of translucent fish sails through the sky, their scales reflecting scenes of futures that might unfold depending on your choice. One fish shows you returning to your world wiser but lonelier, having sacrificed comfort for raw truth. Another shimmers with visions of shared triumph, but shadows coil in its tail, hinting at sacrifices unnamed.

Your pulse drums louder. The bridge dips slightly, spider-silk threads vibrating with sympathetic tension, as if the dream itself leans forward, eager. You stretch out your hand toward the left door—then halt, fingers hovering. The wood exhales a sigh that sounds suspiciously like relief. Meanwhile, the bronze door emits a single low note, a resonant hum you feel in your bones, a promise of steady strength.

Images flash behind your eyes: the face of someone you love, half-hidden behind a curtain of light; a seedling pushing through black soil; a comet splitting the sky; the delicate flutter of a moth’s wings. Each image stakes a silent claim on your choice. Your heart wavers, a pendulum poised.

Then you notice something you’d missed: faint constellations etched into the railing of the bridge itself. They form a third path—a secret pattern suggesting that choice is not a binary at all, but a spiral. Perhaps you can step off the bridge entirely, dive into the ocean of aurora, and let its glowing currents bear you somewhere no door can lead.

Taking a breath tinged with ozone and honeysuckle, you decide—
