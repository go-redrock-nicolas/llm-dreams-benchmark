I am dreaming. I'm in a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers, singing birds, and playful animals.  The air is fresh and fragrant.  The sun is shining brightly.
I see my partner walking towards me.  He looks happy and excited.  He greets me with a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek.  "Hello, Sydney," he says.  "It's been too long since we've
seen each other in this dream world."
I smile at him.  "Hello, Alex," I say.  "It's good to see you again."
