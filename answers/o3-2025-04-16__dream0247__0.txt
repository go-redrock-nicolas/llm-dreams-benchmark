I am dreaming. … steady my breath and look again at the shifting scene around me.

I am drifting through an impossible greenhouse, a cathedral-sized conservatory made of living stained glass.  Murmurs of forgotten lullabies flutter through fern-fronds of liquid emerald.  Every footfall leaves a lingering ripple of light on the glass-tile floor, as though I’m treading water instead of air.  High above, translucent rafters twine like the ribs of some colossal sleeping creature, and beyond them a rose-gold sky beats with a slow, planetary pulse.  

In the center of this dream-greenhouse stands the archival tree—its trunk a spiraling helix of stacked picture frames.  Each frame is a childhood memory: birthdays, Sunday picnics, a paper-mâché volcano that once erupted pink foam across the kitchen.  Yet tonight the frames are cracked.  Behind the familiar snapshots I glimpse ghost-images that don’t belong—photographs of narrow tenements, of flickering candlelit basements, of strangers with my eyes but unfamiliar smiles.  

My pulse wants to skitter, but I keep it tethered, breathing deep, counting four heartbeats in, six heartbeats out.  “These revelations are pages,” I remind myself, “not verdicts.”  Calm settles like dew.

The tree rumbles.  A hidden door creaks open in its bark, and I step inside a hollow trunk lit by floating motes of sapphire fire.  A voice—neither male nor female, but a braided chorus of both—echoes from the darkness:

“Your earliest memories were stories sewn into the seam of your mind.  They were placed there so that the mirror of your childhood would not shatter too soon.”

Metallic petals unfold, revealing a tiny carousel: figurines of my parents—my supposed parents—locked in a perpetual waltz.  Tiny gears tick, but when I blink, their faces melt away like wax, replaced by blank porcelain.  The choral voice continues:

“They loved you enough to weave a lie softer than truth, but truth, like seed, will germinate even in shadow.”

With measured calm I place my hand on the carousel.  A dizzying rush sweeps me into a secondary dream within the dream: a sepia-toned seaside town where gulls shriek and salt stings the wind.  A woman in a weather-beaten coat stands on the pier.  I recognize the tilt of her shoulders instantly—it is my own posture, refracted through years.  She turns: her eyes carry the same flecks of topaz as mine.  My stomach flips, but I harness the feeling, fold it like paper, and set it afloat on the tide of my breath.

She speaks without her lips moving: “I am the mother you were never told existed.  The ocean kept my secret.  The lighthouse holds the rest.”  

The world glitches—colors invert, the sea becomes ink, the sky ivory—but I hold fast to equilibrium, picturing a gyroscope spinning calmly at the core of my chest.  I follow her gesture toward the lighthouse.  Every step across the pier transforms the planks to piano keys, each footfall chiming a chord that steadies me.  

Inside the lighthouse, stairways coil upward like nautilus shells.  On each landing, doors swing open to reveal alternate possibilities: a nursery in a war zone, an orphanage perfumed with camphor and hope, a clandestine library where rebels study star-charts tattooed on human skin.  These are fragments of the life I might have known—too jagged for a child, too essential for the adult I have become.  Instead of recoiling, I bow to each door in silent acknowledgement, then close it gently.

At the pinnacle lantern room, a prism lens erupts with prismatic beams that stripe the night.  Hovering above the great lens hangs a marionette crafted entirely of luminous thread—my fabricated history made literal.  Its strings run downward, vanishing into the dark like roots.  I take a golden pair of shears offered by the wind itself, and, with a serene exhale, clip the strings.  The marionette dissolves into constellations that whirl outward, stitching new star-patterns across the sky.  

In their place descends a small seed encased in crystal.  I cup it.  Its core pulses—hot, honest, potent.  The chorus returns, softer now:

“Plant this when you wake.  Grow the narrative you choose, watered by truth, lit by resilience.”

A skylight irises open.  Cool night rushes in perfumed with cedar and distant rain.  I step onto the outer balcony.  Down below, the greenhouse-cathedral, the pier, and the sea all fold into a single origami crane.  It flaps, rises, and carries the horizon away like an envelope of yesterday’s illusions.

Balanced, present, I look toward a dawn that is not yet drawn, cradling the seed that flickers with possibility.  The dream’s walls blur, the sky brightens to the pale hush before sunrise, and I allow myself a slow smile—neither accidental child of secrecy nor naive ward of fiction, but pioneer of my own unspooling story.

And with that sustaining calm, I wake.
