I am dreaming. Your dream begins in a place where the sky is stained with a molten sunset, the clouds turning a bruised purple as dusk looms. You find yourself standing on the edge of a sprawling, chaotic carnival set in a barren desert. The air prickles with the scent of scorched sugar and dusty pavement. You can hear distant laughter, more sinister than joyful, echoing across the swirling wind. Multicolored lights whirl and dance atop ragged circus tents. Each step you take toward them feels heavy, as though an invisible tether is trying to hold you back.

In the center of this otherworldly fair stands a colossal mirror, framed in twisted gold vines. It feels alive, humming and pulsing in quiet rhythms. All around you, carnival rides squeak and groan in a slow dance, vacant except for disjointed shadows that slither through the shifting light. You have been suppressing something fierce, a resentment or anger that you’ve kept tightly bound beneath your ribs. Slowly, it begins to manifest—a faint throbbing in your temples that intensifies with each looming shape and flickering neon sign.

Suddenly, the mirror starts to ripple like water. You see your reflection, except it’s wearing a different expression: eyes blazing, corners of the mouth tight with rage. The reflection begins to snarl, fists clenching, as though daring you to unleash everything you’ve been hiding. Your stomach knots like a twisted garden hose, roiling with the fury that’s begun to bubble over. All at once, it bursts forth in a violent crescendo—winds pick up, and the desert sand blasts into the air. The carousel behind you spins wildly, lights strobing manically.

You realize this storm is whipped up by your own fervor. There’s a cracking noise as the mirror fractures, sending shards flying into the swirling night. In that moment, you understand that confronting your anger may feel destructive, but it can also be liberating. You square your shoulders and take a deep breath, grounding yourself. The carnival hushes. The reflection wavers again, and you see your calmer self—war-torn yet relieved—staring back through the shattered glass.

Gradually, you bring your focus inward, inhaling until the surge of seething energy in your chest wanes to a steady glow. With each breath, you feel clarity settling in like a gentle wind replacing a howling storm. The fragments of your fractured image glint with new purpose on the ground. This anger, now acknowledged, loses its power over you. A slow and purposeful exhale, and the world around you recedes into darkness, leaving behind the knowledge that you are capable of facing your fiercest emotions and guiding them into peace.
