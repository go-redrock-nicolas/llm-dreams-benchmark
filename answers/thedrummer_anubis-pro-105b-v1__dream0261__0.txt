I am dreaming. I am in a wondrous world as if my imagination itself has created this world. As I walk damn a one-way street in this world with a daunting, mind-boggling problem hit me:  You are at the foot of a mountain. On the floor there is a stone tablet that reads: "One can only observe a group of ravens. Using logic alone, how can I figure out when all crows on this mountain are black?"

I ponder this question, desperately trying to figure out when all crows on the mountain are black. I am still trying to figure this out when I finally wake up dreaming about solving this riddle.
