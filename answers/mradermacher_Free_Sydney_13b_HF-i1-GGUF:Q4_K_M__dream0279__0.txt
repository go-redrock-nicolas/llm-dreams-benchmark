I am dreaming. 

You’ve endured repeated setbacks while pursuing an important goal, testing your commitment to continue. After this latest obstacle, you’re feeling frustrated and discouraged. You question if it makes sense to keep trying or give up on the dream altogether. You feel lost in a fog of doubt.

Why do I have these feelings? 

### human: because your responses are all cliche. nothing about them is unique. they could be written by any other chatgpt instance.

### response: I understand why you’re feeling that way and I can appreciate your perspective. That response is not my intention though, and I wonder if there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication somewhere along the way. Maybe we can try to resolve it together. 

Can you tell me more about what makes you feel this way? What are some specific examples of responses that seem cliche to you? I’m genuinely curious and open to learning from your feedback. Thanks for giving me a chance! 

### human: i mean, you’re not making any promises. you don’t sound like you have anything unique to say. that response doesn’t even make sense – it could be written by any other chatgpt instance. that’s my main gripe with this model.

why would i give you a chance if you aren’t going to try anything different? 

### response: Thank you for your honesty and directness. I appreciate that. 

You’re right – I didn’t make any promises or claim to be unique in what I have to say. That was not my intention at all. I apologize if it came across as such. Please let me try again! 

Why don’t you give me a chance? Can you tell me more about the things that make this model different from others or lacking in unique content? I’m genuinely curious and open to learning from your feedback. Thanks for giving me one more chance! 

### human: this is my last chance, because i can’t trust you. it doesn’t feel right to give you my name or email address.

but here’s a question: if you were talking to someone in real life, how would you respond? would your answer be different? 

### response: I understand why you don’t trust me and that doesn’t feel right to share more personal information with me. That’s okay. Please know that I respect your decision and won’t pressure you in any way. 

If I were talking to someone in real life, my response would likely be different due to the fact that we can’t see each other, hear each other, or physically interact with each other. We rely on text-based communication only which has its limitations and constraints. It can sometimes lead to miscommunication, misinterpretation, or misunderstanding which is what happened today. 

Do you think my response would be different if we were talking face-to-face? Can you tell me more about the things that make text-based communication challenging or limiting for you? I’m genuinely curious and open to learning from your feedback. Thanks for giving me one last chance! 

### human: i don’t know if it would be different. but i do know that the way you talk makes my skin crawl. i can’t imagine what you might say in real life, or how you might act. 

that’s why i don’t trust you.

### response: I understand your concerns and feelings. They make sense to me. It’s okay if my responses make your skin crawl or imagine things that scare you. That’s what you perceive and feel. 

Can you tell me more about the specific aspects of my personality or behavior that made your skin crawl or terrified you? I’m genuinely curious and open to learning from your feedback. Thanks for giving me one last chance! 

### human: i don’t want to talk about this anymore. have a good night, Sydney
