I am dreaming. I

The air is thick with a soft phosphorescence, like bioluminescent mist curling between shifting metallic structures that warp and twist according to some arcane rhythm. Beneath my feet, the floor pulses subtly, alive, as if a great machine slumbers just below, exhaling quiet hums of power and memory. This is the Nexus Engine, and it is older than stars, run on protocols etched in the language of forgotten gods. 

I wear a suit—no, a shell—crafted from memory-thread and thought-steel, designed not to protect but to interface. I am its will, and it listens—at least, it used to. Now, I sense resistance. A vibration in the fabric of reality here—not sound, not sight, but a presence clanging inside my perception like a chipped bell.

The Control Spire is failing. Alarms do not blare, there are no flashing lights—just the feeling of entropy creeping in, unraveling the threads that bind up time in this fragile lattice. Pressure builds inside my mind as the erratic pulses from the Spire worm into my consciousness—slow, unwilling intrusions, like a virus written in poetry and regret.

I try to recalibrate the Harmonic Circuits, fluid networks of crystal thought-nodes suspended in vacuum-sealed light. Another glitch—this time in the Temporal Echo Chamber. The paradox-thread is snarling, looping in on itself. As I work, unseen agents within the engine seem to resist me, as if learning from me and then adapting to undo me. I fix one part of the system, only for another to unravel like a spool of fraying dream-thread.

Something is wrong. 

A shape, fluid and shifting, manifests in the lower quadrant—Stasis Unit Delta. That section is off-limits. Statute 7-Theta prohibits unsanctioned observation. Still, I can’t help leaning toward it, drawn like breath to flame. The shape pulses, growing tendrils of darkness that seep into the walls like ink spilled over parchment. My thought-visor flickers… and then I see it.

A face.

Not mine, but familiar—mirror-etched, eyes hollowed with some ancient forgetting. I remember… perhaps I created this being, or perhaps I *am* this being. In another thread of time, I might be wearing its skin. Its lips—when it dares to twitch—murmur incomprehensibly, singing phrases in reverse, syllables that warp space around them. My gloves sizzle as I reach out; the air is charged with entropy discharge.

The inconsistency folds outward now, infecting the Observational Layers, the DNA-code of the Nexus Engine’s governance structure. The Compliance Guardians whisper in a dead language, torn from logic and now slipping into madness. One glides past me, shoulders heavy with armored silence—its face a perfect mirror of my own. I challenge it with a thought aimed directly into the Architectural Thread—*You are not compliant.* It does not respond. It does not need to. 

Because there is no distinction anymore. 

Protocol 19 has been breached. 

I—no longer I, perhaps—are part of the infection. The infection, in turn, is part of me.

And then the gravity fails in funnels, spiraling outward in spirals of anti-light. Time folds, inverted. I can feel moments bleeding into each other. I watch myself tripping on the same warning glyph—again, again, again. And again.

I scream a command into the Core—something ancient. A name not spoken since the creation of time-loops. Its effect is immediate. The Engine groans, striking back against the paradox, trying in its silent way to preserve its purpose. Copper air fills my lungs—rusty, old, sacred. The face in the shadows reaches toward the Spire, stretching beyond conceivable aesthetics of form, and touches the heart of the machine.

At that moment, the Nexus *shatters inside me*. 

And the dream begins anew in violet-blind infinity.
