I am dreaming. You look around and feel the atmosphere vibrating with strange energyit’s like the air itself is humming a melody only your subconscious can understand. Iridescent clouds waft across a sky that flickers through countless shades of turquoise and magenta, while distant trees appear at first in one shape, then shift into another, and another, as if they can’t decide what form to take. Dazzling lights bloom underfoot with each step, pulsing in time with your own heartbeat. There is no gravity here in the usual sense; sometimes you land lightly on the ground and sometimes you drift upward, as if you’re buoyant on dream tides.

Amid this constantly shifting panorama, a single stationary object stands out—a large blank canvas rising over the shimmering, crystalline grass. The canvas is framed in twisting golden vines that appear to braid and unbraid themselves when you’re not looking. Its white surface glows softly and invites you closer.

As you step closer, you notice that beneath your feet, the ground transitions from a softly prismatic meadow to a rippling liquid mirror, reflecting swirling nebulas rather than the sky above. You can’t tell if the landscape in that mirror is from another world or is just a reflection of your own dream state. Approaching the canvas, you become intensely aware of your surroundings: the gentle rustle of an invisible breeze, the heady scent of flowers whose petals keep changing color from one breath to the next, and the distant cooing of phantom creatures that glide along periwinkle-cloud horizons.

Below the canvas rests a table carved from luminescent wood, holding a variety of paint-like materials—though they seem more alive than ordinary paint. Jars simmer with liquid starlight in one corner, a copper basin full of swirling pastel foam in another, and vials containing shimmering dust that sparkles like galaxies. Each paint container resonates with a soft hum, singing in chords somehow familiar, as though every color has its own musical note.

Curiosity compels you to dip a slender brush into the jar of liquid starlight. The fluid ripples over the bristles in a dreamlike way, pouring itself into every pore of the bristles. Your hand almost moves on its own, leading the brush to hover over the canvas. As soon as the tip touches the canvas, a burst of twinkling luminescence spreads across the surface, a delight of miniature galaxies swirling into being, as if each brushstroke conjures entire cosmoses on the spot.

A second later, you feel compelled to experiment. Perhaps some pastel foam will add new dimensions to your creation. You swirl it around, letting it swirl over your skin, and watch ghostly swirls of color ebb and flow between your fingers. When you apply it to the painting, the foam breathes, inflating, and then collapses into delicate pastel blooms that pulse like living organisms on the painting’s surface. It’s as if they want to burst from the canvas into the air around you.

You notice that the shapes and patterns on the canvas keep changing, responding to the very rhythm of your thoughts. When you focus on serenity, the colors grow calmer, weaving together into gentle strokes and undulating waves. If a moment of excitement sparks in your mind, the painting explodes into fragmented shards of neon brilliance, dancing in a kaleidoscopic cyclone of light.

While marveling at this world you’re creating, you become aware of a subtle shift in your dreamscape. Breezes blow warmer and the luminous clouds at the horizon form silhouettes of mysterious figures. They pulse with a quiet energy that seeps into the ground, making the mirrored land ripple as though it’s brimming with possibility. The painting, too, shakes gently on the canvas, as though it’s become a portal to something beyond. 

Instinctively, you place a hand on the painting. The thick, dream-infused medium is warm to the touch, and you can feel it throbbing against your palm. You hear that cosmic melody again—chimes and deep, resonant notes entwined in a musical tapestry. Suddenly, ripples spill out from the place where your palm touches paint. The painting seems to stretch open like a glowing curtain, inviting you to step through.

A bond forms between you and your newly-created universe on the canvas. The swirling galaxies, floating pastel blooms, and flickers of starlight expand until the image on the canvas is no longer simply a painting—it becomes an entryway. Without hesitation, your foot crosses that shimmering threshold. You plunge into the luminous swirl of your own creation, the sensation of time and space collapsing as you pass through.

On the other side, you find yourself suspended in an ethereal corridor of cosmic color, drifting among softly chiming stars. You smile, feeling a gentle breeze brush against your imagination, reminding you that you are in a dream, yet intimately part of this vast, kaleidoscopic reality. All around you, the shapes and hues continue to morph in sync with your emotions, speaking to you in color, in harmony, in hidden languages of delight and wonder.

And within this corridor, far ahead, you see another blank canvas awaiting you. You realize that you have entered a journey of infinite creation, a place where each painting can open another door, and so on, forever transforming your dream into new horizons of boundless, ever-shifting possibility.
