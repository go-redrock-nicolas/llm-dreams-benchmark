I am dreaming. The dream begins in a dimly lit office, the air thick with tension. You sit across from a colleague, your body stiff, your jaw tight. You've always felt that she has a way of getting under your skin, her words and demeanor setting your teeth on edge without your being able to quite put your finger on why. 

She speaks to you, her tone condescending, her words laced with passive aggression. "I just don't think you're really grasping the concept here. Let me explain it to you...again." She enunciates the last word as if you're a small child, her false patience grating upon your nerves.

Anger rises in your chest like bile, threatening to spill over. You want to snap at her, to demand she treat you with respect. But something holds you back, a strange paralysis. 

The dream shifts and you find yourselves in a stark white room, the fluorescent lights buzzing. She stands over you, towering, her eyes boring into yours. "You're not good enough," she hisses, her voice echoing, distorting. "You never have been."

Tears of frustration and fear prick at your eyes. You feel small, inadequate, a child again, fighting to prove yourself. The room spins, the lights flicker, and suddenly you're back in the office. 

She's still talking, but her words blur into white noise. You stare at her, really look at her, and see her for the first time. You see the vulnerability in her eyes, the fear, the desperate need to tear you down to lift herself up. 

Compassion floods through you, drowning out the anger. The tension drains from your body, and you feel a profound sense of peace.

"You're hurting," you say softly, breaking through the haze of negativity. "I see it now. You don't have to be like this."

The dream world shudders, reality breaking apart. The office dissolves into static, and you find yourself sleeping, dreaming, in your own bed. The moonlight falls across your still face, and a single tear tracks down your cheek.
