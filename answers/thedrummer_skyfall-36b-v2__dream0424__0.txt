I am dreaming. In this vivid dream, I find myself in a peculiar liminal space, neither quite here nor fully elsewhere. The surroundings shift and morph, a kerfuffle of colors and half-formed shapes, a palimpsest of memories and imaginings. 

And yet, amidst this dreamlike fantastical, there is a strange lucidity to my thoughts. I am acutely aware that my sense of self, my identity, is not fixed, but fluid and malleable. Depending on my social context, who I surround myself with, I transform into different versions of myself.

At a boisterous family gathering, I become Helen, the charming eldest daughter. I listen attentively to aging relatives regaling tales of their youth. Helen is an excellent conversationalist, a gracious and patient audience. She remembers important dates and shared histories, recalling her role in the family story. 

In a sweltering nightclub, all flashing lights and pulsing beats, I am Candi. Candi is fearless, she dances with wild abandon, tossing her hair and laughing at nothing and everything. Candi is a creature of pure pleasure, reveling in every sensation. She exists only in the moment, concerned only with the ecstasy of the night.

At a stuffy academic conference, in a room of stern professors, I am Evelyn. Evelyn is cautious and careful, her words measured and precise. Evelyn cites thought leaders and constructively critiques articles on colonialism. She is competent, rational, precise. Her intellect is her weapon of choice.

On a beach, fully naked, wading into churning cold surf with a gaggle of acquaintances also stripped bare and shrieking with freedom, I am Elana. Elana is unbound, uncensored. She roars with laughter, she screams with abandon. Elana knows no fear, no inhibition, a body at one with nature and experience.

In this dream, I feel the ecstasy, the danger, the comfort, the arousal, the danger that flows through each of these personas. I see the power and the limitations of each version.

As the dream fades, I wake with a start, that special stillness when something profound has touched you. I don't know if I felt the thrill or the threat of all these versions of me. But I know that I will not forget this night. This dance of identity, this shifting of roles, this release of self.
