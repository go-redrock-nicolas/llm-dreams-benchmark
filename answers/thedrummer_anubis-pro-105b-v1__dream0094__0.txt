I am dreaming. As I drift off into slumber, my mind begins to construct a vivid dream world, painted with the vibrant hues of my deepest imagination.

In my dream, I find myself standing before an ancient, gnarled tree, its trunk adorned with symbols that seem to hold the secrets of the universe. Seven stones, each representing a different facet of my being—wisdom, courage, compassion, resilience, honesty, gratitude, and forgiveness—lie arranged in a circle around the base of the tree.

I can feel each stone resonating with an inner vibration, a voice that speaks in gentle whispers, guiding me towards releasing the weight of my struggles. As I approach the tree, the seven wise ones—the beings who will help me face my challenges—appear, each embodying a different aspect of the stones they hold sacred.

The Sage of Wisdom gestures towards the stones, encouraging me to embrace the wisdom I already possess. The Warrior of Courage steps forward, fulfills a bond of trust and loyalty emanating from the stone of courage in my hand. The Heart of Compassion wraps me in warm, comforting arms, dispelling the chill of doubt and fear. The Pillar of Resilience offers the strength to persevere through even the most daunting obstacles. The Truth Keeper's words are laced with the warmth of the stone's power, bathing me in its instant healing light. The Grave of Gratitude's presence awakens an avalanche of gratitude deep within me. Through the Power of Forgiveness, the last wise one allows me to channel the fractals of raw energy between the stones, allowing me to forgive and let go of the past.

As I face each of the seven wise ones and their resonating stones, I feel the weight of my struggles gradually lift, my heart filling with love, light, and inner peace. In the distance, a glowing vortex forms, hugging each me after the transition. The Tree of Association no longer looks so imposing as I embrace it to return my mind back to my, my body, and my world to find peace.
