I am dreaming. In this dream, I am in a room filled with people - strangers and familiar faces alike. It's a bit crowded, but there's an air of comfort that momentarily puts me at ease. The atmosphere changes as soon as the topic of conversation shifts to one that I have strong feelings about. My heart begins to race, but I force myself to stay calm.

The group's opinion is mostly against what I believe in. I can see the disagreement on their faces, and yet, they continue to express their views confidently. Everyone is so certain about their beliefs, except for me. I feel small and insignificant in that moment, like my opinion doesn't matter.

I start to panic within myself, feeling like I'm going to explode with all these thoughts and feelings. Taking a deep breath, I gather up all my courage and find the words to express my disagreement. As soon as I speak, everyone's heads turn towards me in surprise. My voice shakes slightly, but I manage to get my point across.

The discussion gets heated, with people arguing both for and against my viewpoint. Passionate voices fill the room, and it's both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. I find myself standing up for myself, my convictions, and my beliefs. The intensity of the situation ignites a fire in me that I didn't know existed.

As the discussion rages on, I realize that I'm no longer afraid. In fact, I'm empowered. My voice is strong and clear, and it resonates throughout the room. Even though we don't reach a consensus, I know that I've made an impact. People are listening to me, and they're taking my thoughts and feelings into consideration.

When I wake up from this dream, my heart is racing, and I feel a sense of accomplishment. I may not have changed anyone's mind or made a huge difference in the world, but I spoke up when it mattered. And that, in itself, is powerful.
