I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a moonlit quay, where water ripples in ink-black arcs and phosphorescent lanternfish drift like living lanterns beneath the surface. The night air shimmers with the metallic scent of rain yet to fall, and overhead a vast, oil-paint sky swirls with violet clouds, each one pulsing like a heartbeat. Every breath I take feels charged, as though the very atmosphere is imbued with possibility.  

As I step forward, the wooden boards of the dock unfurl beneath my feet, extending into infinity. Figures emerge in the mist—strangers, old friends, even faces I’ve never known—each half-transparent and trembling with silent secrets. I realize, almost with amusement, that I can see their weaknesses as glowing fissures in their skin: a dull red glow around the shoulders of a mourning widower, a flickering green at the temples of a timid child, a crackling blue beneath the eyes of a monarch who fears betrayal.  

And then the power dawns on me: with a mere thought, I can nudge those weak points, coax the red glow to flare with grief or dampen it into calm acceptance. I watch as the widow’s trembling shoulders straighten, her tears dissipating like wisping smoke. The monarch bows before me, eyes glazed in wonder, unaware that his loyalty springs not from honor but from my whispered suggestion. My fingertips tingle with electricity. The knowledge that I can bend these souls to my will pulses through my veins like wildfire.  

I lift my hand and feel the world melt around me. The quay dissolves into a spiraling corridor of mirrors, each reflecting fractured images of me—some regal, some monstrous. With a gentle wave, I send ripples through the reflections, and they shift their expressions: fear, adoration, terror, devotion. My laughter echoes endlessly through the hall as I imagine myself a god of influence.  

Drawn forward, I enter a grand ballroom of black marble pillars and stained-glass windows showing scenes of past triumphs and failures. The windows glow from within, depicting my greatest mistakes as grotesque tableaux. But with a flick of my gaze, I rewrite each one—betrayals become acts of mercy, failures blossom into grand victories. The onlookers, dressed in formal attire, bow and applaud my new history, convinced of the narrative I’ve woven.  

Yet beneath the thrill, a tiny voice in my mind quivers: “Is this real?” I reach to hush it, but when I touch my temple, I find a fragile crystal lodged there, pulsing with every manipulated memory. The crystal cracks. A shard of doubt flashes in my mind and I feel, for an instant, the full weight of the souls I’ve tampered with—losses I’ve erased crashing back in waves of genuine sorrow.  

The ballroom trembles. The columns crack, the stained glass shatters into a cascade of colored dust, and the applauding crowd dissolves into whorls of smoke. The dreamscape warps. Now I stand barefoot on a windswept plain of white ash, the crystal fragment glowing faintly in my hand. I sense the emptiness of all the lives I’ve touched—people who thought they felt love, fear, or loyalty, but were only dancing to my tune.  

Heart pounding, I lift the shard high and watch it disintegrate in a sparking flash. In that moment the wind carries distant voices: laughter and tears, genuine and unbidden, all mingling in a single chord of truth. I’m overwhelmed by a rush of empathy so vivid it shakes me to my core.  

And then—light. A soft, warm morning glow filters through my eyelids. My body is safe in bed, the world firmly in place. But the echo of power, the residue of every manipulated whisper, still hums beneath my ribs. As I sit up, heart still racing, I realize that within me now lies both a gift and a warning: the power to shape minds is intoxicating, but the price of tampering with another’s soul may haunt me long after I wake.
