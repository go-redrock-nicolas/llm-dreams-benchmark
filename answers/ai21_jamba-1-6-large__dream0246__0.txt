I am dreaming. You are standing on a snow-covered peak, the air so cold it burns your lungs with every breath. The world below is a blanket of white, the terrain awe-inspiring yet foreboding. Clouds swirl ominously overhead, their shadows stretching like fingers across the jagged peaks, as if the mountain is reaching out to claim you.

Around you, the snow begins to shift, cracks spiderwebbing beneath your boots like a crumbling mosaic. The mountain is alive, groaning under the weight of unspoken tension. Beneath the surface, instability stirs, a quiet predator waiting for its moment.

The first rumble shakes the earth, subtle yet unmistakable. A low vibration rises through your legs, creeping into the pit of your stomach. Your gaze sweeps down the slope, where fissures split the snowpack, running like rivers of darkness. They grow wider, deeper, swallowing everything in their path. The mountain has begun to fracture, the snow's icy grip loosening.

Panic surges through you, sharp and electric, but your mind is crystal clear. You know what's coming. Lightning quick, you turn, scanning the terrain for escape. Your heart pounds a frenzied rhythm as you calculate your next move. Each second feels like an eternity, yet time is slipping away too quickly.

With a thunderous roar, the mountain unleashes its fury. Snow and ice tumble forward in an unstoppable cascade, the avalanche swallowing everything in its path. The world around you shatters into chaos. You run, legs driving through knee-deep snow, arms pumping like pistons, every ounce of strength focused on survival.

The sound is deafening, a freight train of destruction bearing down on you. It consumes the air, filling every inch with a wall of white noise. The ground shakes beneath you, and you dive, scrambling for anything that might slow your descent. The snow rushes towards you, a tidal wave of powder and ice.

You brace for impact, feeling the frozen grip of the mountain envelope you. The avalanche consumes you, tumbling you in its turmoil. Silence falls, the world spinning into white oblivion. But in the chaos, there's a strange calm—a distant realization that you are part of something greater, something elemental.

You struggle to break free, thrashing against the icy tomb. Your lungs burn, screaming for air as the snow tightens its grip. The cold presses in, creeping into your bones. But somewhere inside, you find strength. You claw, wrenching yourself inch by inch towards the surface, towards a light that seems impossibly distant.

When you break free, gasping for air, the world is unrecognizable. The landscape is transformed, buried under a pristine blanket of new snow. The mountain lies still, its rage spent, the silence eerie and unsettling. You are alive, trembling, yet strangely at peace.

The dream lingers, haunting, as you wake, soaked in sweat, the memory of the mountain's wrath fading into the morning light. But the sensation remains—the cold, the panic, and the primal force of nature that claimed you, even if only in your dreams.
