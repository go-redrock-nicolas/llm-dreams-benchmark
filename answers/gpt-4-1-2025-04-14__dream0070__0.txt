I am dreaming.

A hush falls over the grand, marbled hall—sunlight crashes through towering stained glass, dyeing the diplomats’ faces in smeared rubies and emeralds. Velvet banners of ancient enemies rustle in a fretful draft. I feel the weight of a heavy medallion warming against my chest, a symbol of fragile peace. 

Across the polished obsidian table, sharp-eyed delegates glint like knife blades, their voices taut and brittle. At my right, an aide tugs my sleeve, whispering the latest intelligence: a border has been breached; old wounds threaten to bleed anew. 

I rise, chair creaking, and all eyes gravitate to me—a hundred-year history of bitterness pulsing in the silence. My voice must weather this storm.

“We stand at the crossroads of memory and ambition,” I declare, surprised by the thunder in my chest. “Let us consider: what future will our children inherit if we sharpen axes instead of bonds?” 

My words ripple, unsettling stoic faces. I reach into the folds of memory and summon a vivid story—of two children on opposite sides of a river, one with a battered violin, one with an outstretched hand. The music bridges the chasm, turning suspicion to curiosity. As I speak, the delegates lean closer, drawn into the painted recollection.

Gradually, tension loosens. Someone lowers their guard, admitting, quietly: “Our people are tired of mourning.” Another slides a peace offering—an ornate box, lacquered with their nation’s crest—across the table. My fingers tremble as I open it, revealing a single olive branch sealed in crystal.

A shiver passes through the room—possibility, delicate as a birdsong. I suggest a symbolic performance, a blending of the two national anthems played by children from both sides. Murmurs bloom; resistance softens.

I awaken with the echo of music—tense hands joined in applause—and the blinding hope that, just for a moment, ancient enemies glimpsed a life beyond enmity. The dream lingers, heavy as a promise, as sunlight dances across my waking eyelids.
