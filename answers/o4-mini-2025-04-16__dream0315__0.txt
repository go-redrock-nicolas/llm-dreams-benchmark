I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the edge of a mist-shrouded lake whose waters glow with phosphorescent teal light. The air is warm and dripping with the scent of night-blooming orchids. Every breath you take feels like inhaling liquid starlight. In the distance, a lone bridge made of ivory bones arches silently across the water, its railings etched with shifting runes that pulse in time with your heartbeat.  

As you step onto the bridge, the surface beneath your feet ripples like mercury. A school of silver-scaled carp bursts from the railings, swirling around your ankles in a silent dance. Their eyes—luminescent coals—seem to watch you closely. Above, a pale moon hangs inverted, its cratered face dissolving and reforming, as if someone were carving a message into it with each passing second.  

Beyond the bridge lies a forest of glass trees. Their trunks refract the moonlight into thousand-coloured shards that float lazily into the air. You reach out to touch one, and it shatters in your hand—but instead of cold shards, you feel warm, pulsing energy, as though you’ve caught a fragment of someone’s deepest memory. The sound of distant singing rises and falls like ocean tides. You follow it, guided by a ribbon of echoing melody that coils around your legs like smoke.  

After a winding path you arrive at a spiraling staircase carved into living stone. Each step bears a symbol you’ve seen before in other dreams:  
 • A clock with no hands  
 • A silver key that will not open any lock  
 • A mirror that reflects not your face but a shifting landscape of deserts and oceans  

You climb. With every step your heart hammers, and the runes on the walls flicker with remembered moments—childhood laughter, tears you thought forgotten, hopes you buried long ago. At the top, you find a door painted in swirling blues and purples. No handle. You press your palm against it; it yields, melting away to reveal a vast chamber hung with thousands of lanterns, each containing a tiny, beating star.  

Here the three symbols converge:  
 1. The handless clock floats overhead. Its empty face seems to say that time is both infinite and fleeting, urging you to honor each precious moment while letting go of what you cannot change.  
 2. The silver key drifts down like a feather. You catch it and hold it close—this key cannot open any earthly door, but it unlocks something in yourself: the courage to embrace mystery, to accept that not every question has an answer you can grasp.  
 3. The mirror shimmers at the chamber’s center. When you peer into it, you do not see a single reflection but a mosaic of all the lives you might lead—artist, wanderer, teacher, dreamer. The mirror reminds you that your identity is not fixed; you are the sum of every possibility.  

As you reach out to that mirror, the stars in the lanterns lift themselves free and swirl together, forming a brilliant cathedral of light. You realize these lanterns are your own fleeting hopes and memories, each one guiding you toward the next step on your journey—though you cannot yet see the path, you trust it will appear when you’re ready.  

The chamber dissolves around you. You stand again by the luminous lake, the phosphorescent water still rippling with unseen life. The bridge, the trees of glass, the staircase—they fade gently into mist. Still in your hand rests the silver key and the echoes of that echoing melody.  

You awaken with your heart full of strange consolation. The dream’s symbols linger on your mind, urging you to embrace the flow of time, to trust the unlocking of your own hidden strengths, and to remember that your life is an ever-shifting mirror of possibilities yet to be explored.
