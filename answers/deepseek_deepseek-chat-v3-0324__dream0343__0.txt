I am dreaming. **Dreamscape: The Shattered Mosaic**  

The dream begins in a vast, cathedral-like office—ceilings stretching into obsidian infinity, walls lined with books written in languages that flicker between familiar and alien. Your footsteps echo hollowly as you move toward a luminous desk, its surface a living mosaic of projects, deadlines, and unspoken ambitions. But something is wrong. Pieces of your work—meticulously crafted reports, strategic plans—are crumbling at the edges, their colors bleeding into gray ash.  

Then you see *them*. A colleague—face half-lit by the cold glow of a hovering screen—stands over the mosaic, their fingers deftly rearranging tiles, twisting your words, altering your designs. Their smile is serene, practiced; the kind that carries the weight of a hundred polite betrayals. You watch as they pluck a tile bearing your latest breakthrough and hand it to a shadowy figure (the CEO? A god of this place?) who nods approvingly, as if it was always theirs.  

A surge of heat floods your chest. You step forward, and the floor trembles—glass cracks spiderweb beneath your feet. "Why?" Your voice isn't yours; it's the howl of a storm trapped in the ribs of the building. The colleague turns, their face flickering through masks: concern, mock confusion, finally settling into something colder than resignation. *"You were just... in the way,"* they say, and the mosaic disintegrates around you, tiles becoming locusts, becoming shards, becoming fog.  

You wake with your fists clenched, the taste of copper on your tongue. The dream lingers—not just as fear, but as a spark. Because now you *know*. And in that knowing, there’s power.  

(Would you like to explore the next scene—the retaliation, the revelation, or the uneasy alliance the dream hints at? The nightmare isn’t over; it’s a thread you’ve just pulled.)
