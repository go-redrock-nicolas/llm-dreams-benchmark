I am dreaming. <placeholderno3>

*The world shifts like liquid mercury, walls melting into a kaleidoscope of fractured light. I’m standing in a labyrinth of doors—each glowing a different hue, each humming with urgency. Five doors glow brighter than the rest, their light throbbing like heartbeats. A whisper echoes from everywhere and nowhere: “Choose. Now.” But the doors are multiplying, splitting like cells, their colors bleeding into one another. I reach for the crimson door—*

**First Task**: *Inside, a storm rages. A child balances on a crumbling cliff above a tempestuous sea. The wind snatches my voice as I scream for them to step back. My feet root to the ground, vines of obsidian curling around my ankles. I tear free, but the cliff cracks, plunging the child toward the waves. My hand catches theirs—ice-cold, trembling—as the ocean roars like a living thing below. Time slows. The child’s face flickers between a stranger’s and my own.*  

**Second Task**: *A pulse yanks me sideways. Now I’m in a sterile lab, surrounded by vials of shimmering liquid—some neon blue, others black as void. A timer counts down: 0:07…0:06… My hands move autonomously, mixing compounds I don’t understand. One wrong drop, the digital display warns, will unravel the city outside. Smoke curls under the door. The air smells like burning sugar. 0:03… My fingertips glow, heating the glass. A drop falls—gold, not black. The lab dissolves.*  

**Third Task**: *A desert stretches endless, dunes rippling like molten copper. A rusted train idles on sun-bleached tracks, passengers frozen in sepia-toned silence. They blink—once—all at once. A ticket in my hand reads: *Destination Unwritten.* The engine shrieks. Sand swirls into faces, names I used to know. If the train leaves empty, the tracks vanish. If it departs full, the passengers dissolve. My shadow elongates, splitting into five figures. Each boards a different car.*  

**Fourth Task**: *A garden overgrown with black roses, their thorns dripping liquid shadow. At the center, a well pulses with green light. A voice—my mother’s?—pleads, “Don’t look down.” But the light morphs into a face, *their* face, the one I swore to forget. The roses tighten around my wrists, dragging me toward the well. I glimpse constellations swirling in its depths, galaxies born and dying. One wrong word, and the universe inside collapses. I whisper, “Stay.” The roses wilt. The well swallows the stars.*  

**Fifth Task**: *A mirrored room, infinite reflections holding trembling scales. On one side: a clock ticking backward. On the other: a feather so light it floats. My breath fogs the glass. The scales tip—time reverses, the feather drifts away. A child’s laugh echoes. My reflection mouths, *Choose honesty or mercy.* I place a hand on both. The mirrors shatter. Shards spiral into a maelstrom, carving words into my skin: *You will always be two people.*  

***The labyrinth returns. The doors are gone. Only echoes remain.***  
*Wind carries the child’s voice: “Did we survive?”*  
*The answer dissolves before dawn.*
