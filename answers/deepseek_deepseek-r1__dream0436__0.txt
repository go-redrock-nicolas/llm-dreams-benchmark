I am dreaming. **Dream Journal Entry: The Labyrinth of Light**  

You find yourself standing at the edge of a labyrinth carved from obsidian and moonstone, its walls shimmering like liquid shadow under a sky strewn with constellations shaped like clasped hands. A cold, whispering wind carries the echoes of old voices—your own, repeating phrases like *“Trust will trap you”* and *“Vulnerability is surrender.”* These words materialize as iron chains around your wrists, heavy and icy, but as you step into the maze, the ground beneath you shifts. Petrified roses bloom underfoot, their petals etched with the faces of people you’ve loved but held at arm’s length.  

A figure appears ahead, cloaked in shifting iridescence—neither human nor ghost, but something akin to starlight given form. They extend a hand, and suddenly, you’re both standing in a mirrored hall where reflections warp and ripple. One mirror shows you alone, armored in spiked ice, majestic but untouchable. Another reveals you laughing, barefoot in a field of wildflowers, skin glowing as others weave garlands into your hair. The clash of images makes your chest ache.  

The figure speaks without moving their lips: *“You’ve mistaken walls for wisdom.”* As they say this, the chains on your wrists crumble into ash, and the labyrinth’s walls begin to *breathe*, contracting and expanding like a living ribcage. You realize the maze isn’t meant to trap you—it’s a heart, and you’ve been walking its chambers alone, fearing the valves would close if you let anyone else in.  

A door of light fractures the obsidian ahead. Through it, you glimpse a shore where the ocean meets a sky of molten gold. Dozens of silhouettes wade in the water, their outlines blurring and merging like ink in rain. One turns—it’s someone you know, but their features are softer, unguarded. They say your name, and it reverberates through you, dissolving the last shards of ice around your ribs. When you step into the water, the waves don’t chill you; they hum, harmonizing with your pulse.  

You wake just as the chains re-form—but now, they’re gossamer-thin, and the key to unlock them rests in your palm, warm and humming like a held heartbeat.
