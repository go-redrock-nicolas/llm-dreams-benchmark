I am dreaming. You're in an arena with other warriors who have also trained for this moment. The goal is to cross a bridge over a raging river. You each step on a stone that appears under your feet. But there's a catch: the stones disappear as soon as you step on them, and if you fall into the water, you die.

You I am dreaming. 

I am dreaming with you.
