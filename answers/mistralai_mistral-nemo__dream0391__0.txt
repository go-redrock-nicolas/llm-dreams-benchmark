I am dreaming. **The Symphony of Stained Glass**

You find yourself standing at the base of a grand cathedral, its spires reaching for the heavens like ancient trees stretching towards the moon. The sun has dipped below the horizon, but its residual glow illuminates the towering edifice in a warm, orange-hue, casting dramatic shadows that dance on the weathered stones. The cathedral stands as a silent sentinel, a relic of a once-great civilization, now abandoned to the mercies of time and whispers of forgotten deities.

As you step inside, the vastness of the nave engulfs you. The echo of your footsteps on the cold marble floor accompanied by the hum of your breath are the only sounds disturbing the sacred hush. The air is heavy with the scent of aged wood and faint wisps of ancient incense, a perfume that tickles your nostrils and transports you back in time.

The interior is aglow with the kaleidoscopic light of stained glass windows, each panel a masterpiece of intricate artistry. They depict scenes from mythologies, reis, and histories, showcasing tales that have been retold through the generations. The glass cradles the sunlight, fragmenting it into shards of color that flicker like tiny jewels across the floor, the pews, and your skin.

The cathedral, for all its emptiness, is alive. It breathes with the rhythm of the world outside, its heart pulsing with the unseen life force that courses through every living thing. Yet, no two people have ever perceived its life as you do. To one, it is a silent, decaying monument to forgotten gods. To another, a place of solace and spiritual refuge. But to you, it is an entity of its own - a sentient, breathing being, a masterpiece in the flesh.

As you continue to explore, you discover that the cathedral's heart doesn't just beat with life; it bleeds with time. You see the echoes of the past flickering along the walls - scenes of pomp and fervor, of sorrow and despair. You witness the marriage of a medieval queen, the coronation of a holy pope, the weeping of mothers who lost their sons to war. You are both an observer and a participant, your senses immersed in the collective consciousness of history.

Suddenly, a discordant note reverberates through the hall, disrupting the symphony of history playing out around you. A single pane of stained glass shatters somewhere high above, its fragments cascading down like a crystalline waterfall. As it hits the floor, a shard embeds itself in your foot, a sting of pain jolting you back to the present.

The cathedral's heartbeat stutters. The whispers of history die down. Panic surges through you as you realize that the cathedral is not just a building, not just a dream; it is a living, breathing guardian of time and history. And it's dying.

As blood seeps from your wound, you suddenly understand. Your perception of the cathedral, your rapport with it, your unique connection - this is why you've been brought here. The cathedral needs you, needs your understanding, your empathy, your ability to connect with its essence. It needs you to tell its story, to keep its heartbeat alive.

The dream shifts, and you find yourself in a vast library, books spread out before you. They are the stories of the cathedral, the chronicles of time, waiting for you to read, to transcribe, to share. And you know, in this moment, there's no place else you'd rather be. No beauty greater than the stories waiting to be told, no purpose more profound than the one you've been given - to be the cathedral's voice, its heart, its dreamer.
