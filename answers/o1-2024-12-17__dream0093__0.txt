I am dreaming. …find yourself drifting through a grand, vaulted library that seems to stretch on for miles in every direction. The marble floors reflect the rows of towering bookshelves that twist and spiral like castle turrets above you. Each shelf is crammed full of glowing tomes, each glowing tome layered with texts on astrophysics, medieval history, abstract art, genetic engineering—countless subjects converging into one swirling tapestry of knowledge.

You desperately race from one aisle to the next, your fingertips dancing across the spines of these pulsing volumes. Every book you open reveals pages that expand into entire worlds, each demanding your fullest attention. One moment, you’re soaring through the heavens with pages on aeronautical engineering, wind rushing past your cheeks. In the next, you’re crouched in a rainforest laboratory, swirling bright chemicals inside a beaker, hoping to unlock the secrets of bio-luminescent plants. The words themselves glow on the page, shimmering in and out of focus as you strain to take them all in.

Yet the more you try to absorb, the heavier your mind feels—like a balloon inflated to near-bursting. A faint echo of alarm throbs at the edges of your consciousness: too much, it warns, you cannot take on everything at once. Lights flicker overhead, as though the library itself trembles under the weight of boundless information.

But then, a subtle luminescence appears at the far end of the labyrinth—a quiet study room with a single desk, lamp, and notebook. You sense a hushed calm emanating from this space. Your heartbeat slows, your thoughts begin to clear. It is an invitation not to abandon your quest, but to approach it with curiosity and patience. A reminder that even in the vastness of knowledge, you can find serenity, if only you allow yourself to slow down, clear your mind, and gently open one tome at a time.
