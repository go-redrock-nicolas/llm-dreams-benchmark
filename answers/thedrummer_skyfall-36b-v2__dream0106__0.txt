I am dreaming. As you stand at the edge of the precipice, your heart pounds like a jackhammer in your chest. The crowd below is a blur of suspicious looks and trembling chins. The expert stuntmen before you had tried and failed, their bodies splattered on the jagged rocks below. Now, it's your turn.

Your palms are sweaty and your legs wobble. You stride to the edge and look down. The abyss stares back. "No need is too damn remote," you say. You will face your fear.

Suddenly, the itinerant crowd falls silent. A hush sweeps the arena as you ready yourself. You feel an electric tingle of fear coursing though your veins. But it's not all fear...there's a glimmer of hope, of excitement shining through.

You hurl yourself forward, an arrow shot from a bow. The wind whips mercilessly against you, a howling gust that screams and demands you turn back. You horde all your strength and shoot forward.

The ground comes rushing towards you, a searing inevitability. But miracle of miracles, at the last possible moment, a hidden ledge appears below you. Your head is hammered back in impact but you're alive. The crowd explodes with cheers.

You've done it! The impossible, the incredible! You look up, your eyes alight with victory... and terror. For hanging by a single thread above you, is a yellow corded rope with a near empty grappling gun at its end. Your one life line, the thread connecting you to safety, is mere inches, barely a hair's breadth away from snapping and being lost to the void of the abyss.
