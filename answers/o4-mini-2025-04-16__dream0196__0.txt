I am dreaming. A gilded proscenium arch towers above me, its carvings of swirling cherubs and phoenix feathers glinting in the amber glow of a thousand floating lanterns. Velvet curtains the color of blood orange fold back to reveal an endless sea of faces, each one pinned to me by bright, hungry eyes. Above them, crystal chandeliers drift like suspended jellyfish, their light rippling through the smoky air. The hush is a living thing, thrumming against my eardrums.

Then a voice—a hush-laced command—echoes from somewhere deep beneath the stage. “You,” it says, “take her place.” In an instant, the great virtuoso who was to perform drifts away, a wisp of music fading, and I’m left clutching a lacquered violin the color of midnight. I’ve never touched a stringed instrument in my waking life—yet here it rests in my hands as if I was born to cradle it. The audience leans forward; each face is a question.

My pulse spikes. I bring the violin to my chin, the wood warm and strangely alive against my skin. My fingers hover over the ebony fingerboard as though I might scorch them. I bow the instrument’s throat—and, to my astonishment, the bow moves of its own accord. Silvery notes unfurl into the air, weaving through the lantern light like ribbons of mist. At first the sound is fragile, tremulous; then, as I let my breath guide me, it swells into a tapestry of notes so rich and sonorous that the entire hall seems to breathe in time with it. The audience heels back, their questions turning to awe.

Suddenly the stage beneath my feet dissolves into a waterlike surface, and each note I draw ripples outward, casting up shimmering reflections of impossible architecture—floating staircases, stairways to clouds, towers that spiral into forgotten skies. Every movement of my bow redraws the dreamscape: a ghostly harp weaves itself into a cove of sea glass, timpani drums erupt like hidden volcanoes, and a choir of unseen voices rises behind me, harmonizing in a language that thrums in my marrow.

I play on, body humming with newfound power, until at last the final note hangs suspended and then shatters into a cascade of glowing motes that drift up to the chandeliers and set them ablaze with brilliant color. The audience rises as one, their applause crashing over me like a tidal wave. The lanterns wink out, the curtains fold themselves closed—and in the last instant before I awaken, I feel the violin’s warmth soften to a gentle pulse, as if it has become a part of me, a secret gift from my own dreaming heart.
