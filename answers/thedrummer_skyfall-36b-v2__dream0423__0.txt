I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself in a lush, vibrant garden, the air heavy with the scent of blooming jasmine. The sun's rays filter through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the grass. I am not alone here; I sense another presence, someone I care about deeply. As I turn to look, I see them standing near a bubbling fountain, their face a.Reggard of warmth and affection. But as I study them closely, I begin to notice small signs that something is amiss.

Their smile seems a little too broad, their laughter a little too forced. The way they offer a caring touch feels like a calculated move, not a natural gesture of tenderness. They speak of their love for me, of their commitment to our relationship, but their words ring slightly hollow, like a beautifully crafted melody played on a slightly off-tune instrument. 

A chill diffuses itself through me, prickling on my skin as I realize that something is indeed deeply wrong. I see them in a new light - their wide smiles now looking more like masks, their touch seemed forced. 

But at the same time, I waver. Could I be overthinking this? Could I be misinterpreting innocent gestures and words? The dream version of me knows that great manipulation often wears the cloak of appearances, like a snake that hisses whilst hissing a lulling tune. 

A breeze rustles the leaves, and I see more subtle signs - a slight averting of the eyes when they talk about their past, a nervous twitch of the fingers when I bring up a certain topic. They tell me how more time together would be good for us - not to build a stronger relationship, but to keep me close to them, to nurture dependence they have developed in me. The realization rocks me to the core.

In the dream, I am caught in a whirlwind of emotions - care and fondness for who I thought they are; fear and hurt at the reality they are becoming. 

Suddenly, the garden begins to shift and change, colors bleeding and shapes warping. The fountain now gurgles ominously, and the sun's rays feel like daggers on my skin. I seem to watch myself in the dream - both observer and participant - struggling to reconcile the image of the loving partner I thought they were with the manipulator they appear to be. 

In the dream, I know what you must do. In the dream, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a precipice, torn between the dream and the awakening.
