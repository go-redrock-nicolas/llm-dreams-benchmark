I am dreaming. I find myself standing on the threshold of a library that stretches impossibly in all directions. The ceiling soars upward into mist, bookshelves extending beyond what my eyes can follow. Each book spine glows with a soft, pulsing light—some azure, others amber or emerald—creating constellations across the dark walnut shelves.

A figure sits at a circular desk in the center, their face shifting like water when I try to focus on it. Sometimes they appear familiar, someone I've known all my life; other moments they're a complete stranger with eyes that seem to know everything about me.

"Your deepest thoughts," the figure says, extending hands made of what looks like evening light. "I need to see them."

The air thickens with the scent of old paper and something metallic, like the taste of a secret held too long. I feel a key warming against my chest—though I don't remember wearing one—and understand instinctively it unlocks something within me.

"Why should I trust you with what I've never shared?" I ask, my voice echoing strangely, as if coming from the books themselves.

The figure smiles, and butterflies made of torn pages flutter from their mouth. "Because you've brought yourself here. Because some truths grow poisonous when kept too dark for too long."

I hesitate, fingers closing around the warm key. Behind me, I sense the door I entered through slowly disappearing. Ahead, beyond the figure, a book floats open, its pages blank and waiting.

Trust feels dangerous. Withholding feels worse. In this moment between moments, I realize the most frightening path and the necessary one are the same.
