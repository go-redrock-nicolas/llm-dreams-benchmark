I am dreaming. I find myself deeply moved by witnessing someone demonstrating extraordinary kindness.  Inspired by this moral exemplar, I start to create a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.

In my dream, I see a city full of people who are suffering from various forms of poverty, disease, discrimination, and isolation.  Many of them live in shantytowns, slums, and ghettos where they face constant threats from powerful elites, ruthless criminals, and brutal militias. 

But then, I see a young woman who is walking through this city.  She is wearing a simple white dress and carrying a large bag filled with food, medicine, books, and other necessities.  

As she approaches different groups of people, she greets them with a warm smile and asks them what their problems are.  She listens to them intently and empathically, understanding their pain and frustration. 

She also offers them solutions that are based on her own knowledge and experience as well as her deep belief in humanity's potential for goodness and progress.  

She teaches them how to grow crops in small patches of soil; build shelters out of recycled materials; create networks of mutual aid and support; fight back against oppression without resorting to violence; communicate effectively with others who may not speak your language etc... She shows them how to make use of available resources such as water, sunlight, wind, heat, earth etc... 

She heals them by showing them how to take care of their bodies and minds through exercise, meditation, prayer, music, arts etc... 

She feeds them by showing them how to cook delicious meals out of inexpensive ingredients; forage for wild fruits and vegetables; raise animals for milk, eggs, meat etc... 

She clothes them by showing them how to make garments out of fabric scraps, animal skins, plant fibers etc... 

She protects them by showing them how to avoid danger from predators, enemies, natural disasters etc... 

And finally, she loves them by showing them how to appreciate beauty in nature, art, culture, history etc... How to feel joy, hope, gratitude, curiosity etc...

As I watch her interact with these people, I am filled with wonder and admiration.  She seems to possess all the qualities that I wish I had: compassion, wisdom, courage, creativity, optimism... 

I want to be like her.

But then, I realize something else:

She isn't just a young woman.

She's also me.

She's you.

And so, I wake up from my dream with a sense of hope and possibility.  Maybe one day, we can all become those who demonstrate extraordinary kindness by helping others solve their problems and achieve their goals.
