I am dreaming.

The walls of my office shift and shimmer, as though each one were painted with brushstrokes of liquid moonlight. Soft lamplight spills over the edges of a worn rug, its intricate patterns quietly twisting and turning like living vines. The air, perfumed with the faint scent of lavender, feels thick against my skin, alive with the intensity of raw emotion.

In front of me sits my client, a looming shadow against the shape-shifting backdrop of my office. They are cradling their head as if it weighed more than lead. Tears slip silently from their eyes—tears that glow like fireflies before dissolving into the fabric of the dream floor. Their voice trembles, each syllable a delicate, quivering thread, woven into the electric hush of the room. The weight of their grief is palpable; it presses against my own chest like the warm push of a summer storm about to break.

I reach out with calm hands—hands that, in this dream, flicker with dancing pulses of blue and gold. I speak softly, yet my voice resonates through the space as if echoing from the bottom of a canyon. A gentle hush follows my words, enveloping the two of us in a moment of suspended reality as the clock on my desk ticks backwards. Every beat of its second hand rewinds time, unraveling my client’s pain, if only for a moment. I can see the tension in their shoulders melt ever so slightly, replaced by a look that pleads for reassurance.

“Take a breath,” I remind them, letting my words ripple through the luminous haze. “You are not alone in your sorrow. Let your tears wash through you, cleansing, and then find what remains.”

Their breathing slows, each inhale stirring the ephemeral patterns on the walls, changing dull grays into swirls of rose and saffron. A grown adult, yet in this moment, I glimpse the trembling vulnerability of a frightened child within them. Gently, I guide them to notice their own strength—an inner light that glistens behind their tear-stained cheeks. I extend a comforting presence, my voice weaving a tapestry of warmth. 

They begin to speak—haltingly at first—about all that has withered within them: a broken relationship, a lost job, a sense of self shredded by loneliness. Each word is a shard of glass, glinting under the lamplight. I listen intently, letting them scatter those shards over the floor between us, where they dissolve into the shifting carpet’s design. In this dream realm, I see every syllable transform into a pulsing orb, drifting upward until it settles softly around the room, like tiny luminous stars. 

I remind them that their despair does not define them, that every soul grieves in its own voice and rhythm, and healing is a tender, circling dance. The tears continue—quieter, steadier now. I can almost sense a whisper of hope flicker in their eyes. 

Through this dream-air charged with possibility, I assure them that the darkest night can nestle within it the hue of the earliest dawn. My client’s shoulders visibly soften. A hushed relief washes over them as they grasp the first hints of acceptance. Outside, the moon shifts behind the gauzy curtains, painting the walls with silver patterns, as if blessing the moment with a serene, otherworldly glow.

At last, a delicate smile curls at the corner of their lips—a flower bud unfurling in spring. In the breathless stillness, a luminescent hush lingers. The atmosphere pulses once more, and I feel a palpable warmth pass between us: the comforting knowledge that their pain was seen, heard, and gently held. 

As I blink in that silence, I sense the dream’s edges fraying, drifting away like silk in a soft wind. The clock, ticking in reverse all this time, finally stops. My client’s tear-streaked face becomes a portrait of resilience. We share a moment that feels like eternity pressed into an instant.

And then—everything dissolves into brilliant, golden light. The dream breathes its final sigh around us, suspended in the promise of solace, then swirls away to usher in waking dawn.
