I am dreaming. I am standing in a grand hallway, the walls lined with portraits of distinguished individuals who have made a significant impact in their fields. As I admire the paintings, I overhear two people whispering nearby. They are talking about me. 

"Did you hear about X's latest project?" one of them asks. 

"Oh yes," the other replies. "It's incredible! They've really outdone themselves this time." 

I feel a surge of pride and excitement. I can't wait to share my work with everyone. 

Suddenly, a shadow falls over me. It's my colleague, Y. Y has always been supportive and encouraging, but there's something off about their demeanor today. They smile at me, but it doesn't reach their eyes. 

"X," Y whispers, leaning in close. "I need to talk to you about your project." 

I follow Y into a nearby office, expecting to hear more about how amazing my work is. Instead, Y closes the door and turns to me. Their face is a mask of concern. 

"X, I'm afraid I have some bad news," Y says. "I've been looking over your project, and it's not what it seems." 

Confused, I ask what they mean. 

"Your project," Y explains. "It's... it's a complete mess. You've made so many mistakes, it's unbelievable." 

I'm stunned. My heart sinks as I realize that Y isn't here to commend my work, but to tear it down. 

"Why?" I ask, my voice trembling. "Why would you do this? We're colleagues." 

"Colleagues," Y repeats. "Yes, we are. But I can't help but feel that your success threatens mine. And so, I've been deliberately sabotaging your work." 

Rage builds inside me. Y has not only betrayed my trust, but also endangered my career and reputation. 

"You're despicable," I spit out. "How could you?" 

Y shrugs. "I had to protect myself," they say. 

The office feels smaller, hotter. I don't know what to do. My dream self seems paralyzed by anger and disbelief. 

Suddenly, the painting of a former colleague on the wall comes to life. The portrait turns towards me, offering a word of wisdom. 

"Some people are not worthy of your time or effort, X," the portrait says. "Don't let them define you. Stick to your vision, and let your work speak for itself." 

I wake up, my heart racing. The dream lingers in my mind, a vivid reminder that integrity and hard work are the true measures of success. Y may have tried to undermine me, but they never could dim my shine.
