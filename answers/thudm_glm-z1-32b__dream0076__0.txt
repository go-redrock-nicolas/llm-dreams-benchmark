I am dreaming. The air is thick with anticipation, like the first moment before a symphony begins. I stand center stage, the spotlight a golden halo around me, its warmth seeping into my skin.  My hands are steady, nerves a distant whisper.  The crowd’s silence is a living thing, breathing with me.  Then I hear it—a faint crackle, like faulty electricity.  I am dreaming.  The air is thick with anticipation, like the first moment before a symphony begins. I stand center stage, the spotlight a golden halo around me, its warmth seeping into my skin.  My hands are steady, nerves a distant whisper.  The crowd’s silence is a living thing, breathing with me.  Then I hear it—a faint crackle, like faulty electricity.  My skates, gilded with rubies that normally hum with ancient magic, are suddenly dead. The ice beneath my blades, usually a mirror-polished expanse, now ripples like oil under heat. I glance down. **Meltwater** pools around my toes.  

A gasp ripples through the stadium. The conductor’s baton hovers mid-air. My partner, a dancer of liquid grace, stumbles as the ice fractures beneath her. The arena’s temperature plummets… then surges. The ceiling vanishes, replaced by a sky of swirling technicolor—neon storms collide in the heavens. My music sheet disintegrates into ash, but the *notes* remain, biting into my skull like static electricity.  

The first dissonance screams out of my throat, raw and electric, as the ice beneath me liquefies. The crowd isn’t *watching* anymore—they’re *drowning*, their screams merging with the geyser of water spurting from the cracks. My partner is gone, swallowed by the flood. The rubies on my skates ignite, not with light, but with the cold blue fire of a dying star. The ice reforms—*wrong*. Jagged, black, alive. It crawls toward the audience like a sentient tongue.  

I skate. Not to perform, but to survive. My movements are a rebellion against physics. The ice screams when I carve it. The water coalesces into hands, clawing at my ankles. My voice fractures, becomes a aria of chaos. The black ice devours the stage, consumes the orchestra pit, swallows the wings where my backup dancers cower. Yet the neon sky answers me—rainbow lightning forks from the clouds, stitching the air into a tapestry of sound. My skates are weapons now, shredding the corrupted ice into shards that fall like frozen comets.  

When the silence returns, the stage is a crater, the crowd’s applause a distant, muted echo. I stand in the storm’s eye, water still dripping from the gems in my hair. The black ice has receded, leaving behind a single crack—a scar glowing faintly violet. In my pocket, I find a shard of my music sheet, bleeding through to form new lyrics. The dream doesn’t end. It breathes.
