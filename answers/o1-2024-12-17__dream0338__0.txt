I am dreaming. I stand at the threshold of a vast white desert, where specks of golden sand drift across my ankles like curious fireflies. The sky above is a swirl of silver clouds, roiling in slow motion as if painted by unseen hands. It feels as though the air itself is alive, gently chattering in my ears—the desert crackles under my feet with faint pops, as though each grain of sand has its own secret humming life.

In this dream, I discover that the desert has split itself into two roads: on the left, a shimmering pathway of glass, bending and curving under the sun’s glaring heat; on the right, a winding wooden boardwalk that stutters its way into the distance. The desert hushes as I attempt to decide.

I focus on the glass path first. It’s mesmerizing, almost hypnotizing in its clarity: I see gentle shapes of fish swimming beneath the surface, as though a magical ocean flows directly underneath. The fish themselves are gemstone-hued—amethyst scales ripple over bright emerald fins—glittering in currents of light. Traveling this path suggests the promise of unwavering clarity. I imagine a future full of luminous possibilities where insight drips from every experience, and I sense a welcomed radiance in my bones. At the same time, I feel the weight of transparency—like I wouldn’t be able to hide from my own truths or illusions on this path. Everything could become clear, perhaps painfully so.

Then my gaze slides to the wooden boardwalk. It meanders in a playful zigzag, each worn plank creaking with a gentle lullaby as breezes nudge them. I hear the faint trickle of hidden streams beneath them, though the water’s source remains a mystery. Following this route, I sense the thrill of exploration, the warmth of possibilities blossoming just beyond my line of sight. My heart quickens to the soft hiss of shifting timbers, as if inviting me to venture into a realm of earthy wisdom and sweet unpredictability. Yet I wonder if I would lose sight of my original goals, lured astray by the boardwalk’s subtle meandering.

I close my eyes. A hush descends. The desert hushes too, as though it is holding its breath for my decision. The fish under the glass route shimmer in the corner of my mind. A soft wooden groan from the right stirs something reminiscent of a lullaby. I think about who I’ve been, who I am now, and who I could become. My chest tightens momentarily at the enormity of the choice—like those intangible crosswinds that shape future lives.

My feet step forward, moving with the surety of subconscious purpose, carrying me without conscious thought. It feels like dancing over the entire desert itself, one foot briefly catching a whisper of glass, the other brushing against worn wood, as if testing one last time. The sanctity of this moment pulses through me. I swallow hard, my heart arches as if to take flight, and I commit to my chosen path. As I place my toes firmly onto either the gentle gleam or the worn glow, my dream reality begins to reverberate with an awakening thunder. Light fractures, the sky cracks open, and I am engulfed by the brilliance of possibility. The desert gradually dissolves—swept away by the roaring swirl of my own heart’s decision—and I become a traveler stepping into the unknown, where new worlds bloom on the horizon of my slumbering mind.
