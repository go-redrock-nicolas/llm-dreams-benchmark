I am dreaming. I am unsure why but I begin walking in a city with people rushing around me looking for ways to make it to their next destination. The people are so focused on their destinations that they fail to see the small things around them. For instance, a flower growing between the cracks in the sidewalk. There's beauty in the flower that they pass up, but they don't realize that beauty is fleeting. I begin to run, not quite sure where I'm going, but life is leading me.

I run until I'm no longer in the city; instead, I'm in a forest. I am still not sure where I'm going, so I continue to run until I trip over something. When I catch myself and look down, I see a key. It is an old key, tarnished but intricate with designs on it. I take the key and start walking into the forest. As I continue to walk, the forest grows darker. I come to a clearing with a small cottage in the middle. 

I open the door and inside, there's an old man sitting in a chair. He smiles and asks me where I found the key. I tell him I found it in the forest. He instructs me to open a chest in the corner of the room. I open the chest and inside there is a piece of paper. The paper says, "You are developing an appreciation for complexity in situations you once viewed as straightforward. Embracing this nuanced understanding, you find new ways forward." 

I wake up from the dream with a sense of clarity. I now understand that life is not as simple as we once thought it was, and that we should appreciate the small things even when we're rushing to our next destination.
