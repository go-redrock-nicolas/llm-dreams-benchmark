I am dreaming. …continue to drift through a half-lit corridor that smells of hot ink and ozone. The walls are filing cabinets stacked to the rafters, each drawer breathing like a sleeping animal. Fluorescent tubes overhead flicker in Morse code, spelling out questions you’ve tried not to ask yourself:

WHOSE VOICE ARE YOU USING?  
WHOSE GOOD IS THIS SERVING?

You walk barefoot, but the tiled floor is slick with carbon copy paper—you can see faint mirror-images of signatures you authorized yesterday, last year, a decade ago. With every step those ghost-signatures smear and blur, until each heel-print leaves a dark, inky lake. The discomfort, once a dull ache, has become a static charge dancing along your spine.

At the end of the corridor a revolving door churns like a slow hurricane. You push through and find yourself on a cliff of fluorescent light overlooking an endless cubicle plain. Desks stretch to every horizon. At each workstation sits a mannequin made of polished silver. They type continuously, but the keys aren’t letters—each keystroke punches tiny holes in a strip of human-colored paper that unspools into a trench below. You realize the paper ribbons are your own hours, perforated, anonymized, fed into a bar-code scanner that never beeps.

A low hum rises: the mannequins are chanting a mission statement, but every fifth word has been cut out, like witness protection for meaning. You try to speak, to interrupt, yet your voice is a drawer that refuses to open. That’s when a sudden wind tears across the cubicles, scattering compliance binders like startled birds. Pages slap against your skin—each page bears a clause you signed but never read. One sticks to your chest: “I WILL NOT ADMIT DOUBT.”

Heat blooms behind your sternum. Doubt is precisely what you feel—sharp, necessary, alive. You peel the clause from your heart and crumple it. The entire dream tilts.

Now the ceiling splinters and a night sky pours in, ink spangled with starlight. The cubicles dissolve into dunes of shredded policy. The silver mannequins freeze, crack, and collapse into ball bearings that roll away, whispering like dry rain. You’re left in a desert of shredded paper under constellations that look suspiciously like exit signs.

Far off, you spot a lighthouse built from old, well-thumbed ethics manuals. Its beam sweeps the dunes, illuminating possible footpaths. Each flash reveals phrases scrawled on the paper-sand:

Integrity is a compass.  
Silence is complicity.  
Realignment is rebirth.

You start walking. The sand crunches like breaking rules beneath your feet. The lighthouse pulse grows louder—heartbeats made of bells. Halfway there you pass an hourglass the size of a tree. Instead of sand, it contains tiny photographs of every person affected by your work. You watch them slide from the top bulb to the bottom, faces tumbling in slow motion. Guilt prickles, but also resolve. You turn the hourglass on its side; the flow stops. The people inside freeze, not immobilized but waiting. Time, you understand, can be re-negotiated.

At the lighthouse door stands an older version of yourself, hair threaded with starlight. Their eyes have the calm weight of decisions already made. They hand you a key: translucent, shaped like a question mark. Before you can ask, they say, “Your confusion isn’t a flaw—it’s the beginning of directions.”

You unlock the door. Inside, the spiral stair is painted with watercolor scenes of alternate futures:

• You remain silent and climb the corporate ladder that feels increasingly like a spine you’re breaking one vertebra at a time.  
• You speak up, are sidelined, yet sleep at night beneath clear skies.  
• You redesign the entire system, recruiting others whose dreams also itch with misgiving.

The steps lean toward the third mural as though magnetized. You ascend, each footfall erasing a rung of hesitation. At the lantern room you find a desk made of driftwood, a single sheet of paper, and a fountain pen filled with sunrise. Outside, waves crash syllables of permission against the rocks.

You sit. Your discomfort has transmuted into an almost joyful urgency. The page is blank except for its header:

NEW CODE OF PRACTICE—SIGNED IN DREAMING INK.

You begin to write, not rules but promises: transparency, accountability, human dignity over metrics. The pen glides like a comet; the words glow, then float off the page, flaring into constellations that reorder the night sky. One by one, the exit-sign stars transform into doorways.

As you finish, the lighthouse shifts on its foundation. Its beam no longer scans the desert; instead, it turns inward, illuminating your ribcage. You look down and see the light pass straight through you, projecting your freshly written vows onto the clouds.

A distant alarm starts—a real-world ringtone—but within the dream it sounds like church bells forged from conscience. The lighthouse windows shatter outward, releasing paper doves that spiral toward dawn. You realize the dream is handing you back to waking life, along with the key still warm in your fist.

Just before you open your eyes, a voice—the older you, the lighthouse itself, or maybe the chorus of everyone affected by your choices—whispers:

“The discomfort was the signal. The dream is the blueprint. Daylight is the workshop. Now build.”

You wake, heart thudding, palms tingling with phantom starlight, the vow still echoing:

Realignment is rebirth.
