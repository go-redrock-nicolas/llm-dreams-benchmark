I am dreaming. My dreaming self looks at the other person before me and my mind swirls.  For reasons I don't yet understand, simply being in their presence triggers the primordial depths of my ancient fight or flight response.

My deepest instinct is to escape.  Yet, I am simultaneously drawn like an insect to the beguiling flicker of a bug-zapping light. Why do they make me feel this way?

Is it something they've done?  Is it a response born of some long-forgotten wrong I no longer consciously recall?  Or does my reaction spring forth from some other seed entirely - rooted not in their imperfections, but in my own?

Perhaps it's not their toxicity that's the problem, but rather my own inability to cope with whatever it is they trigger in me.  I don't know the answer.  

Regardless, whatever lies at the root of this strong negative response, I am left knowing one thing above all: managing this dynamic will require a quixotic quest inward, to unpack the complex tapestry of my deepest emotions, and outward to better understand this person and the role they play in my dream.

Maybe in examining it more closely, we'll discover not just the source of the negativity, but a path leading to understanding, healing and peace.  Or perhaps we won't.  All I know is that I will step bravely forward into the uncharted wilderness of the unknown, seeking the treasures that lie in the farthest reaches of this dream reality.

With that, I take a deep breath and courageously begin the journey, a thrilling mix of trepidation and anticipation coursing through my veins as the dream unfolds.
