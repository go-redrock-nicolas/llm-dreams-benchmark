I am dreaming. I am swimming in a river of colors. Blue, green, pink, and violet currents swirl and eddy around me. I reach out to touch the colors, but they shift and blend with my fingers. I dive deeper, searching for the source of the colors. 

I see a glowing orb at the bottom of the river, pulsing with a warm, golden light. I swim towards it, but the currents become stronger, pulling me away. I try to fight them, but I lose my breath. 

I wake up. I am in my bed, safe and sound. I lie still for a moment, feeling the warmth of the sun filtering through the window. I feel alive.
