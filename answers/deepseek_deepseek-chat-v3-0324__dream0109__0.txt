I am dreaming. **The Dream of Shattered Symmetry**  

You open your eyes to a sky that is not a sky—a vast, inverted ocean of liquid mercury, undulating in slow, silken ripples as though brushed by the hand of a slumbering giant. The horizon does not recede but instead *curves inward*, a funnel of obsidian spires and twisting silver bridges that spiral deeper into the city rather than stretching outward. You realize, with a pulse of vertigo, that up and down are merely suggestions here—gravity is a whim, not a law.  

The air thrums with voices that are not voices—a chorus of chiming crystals and murmuring shadows, words materializing not as sound but as floating glyphs that hover before dissolving into perfumed smoke (vanilla and something metallic, like crushed lightning). The people—*if they are people*—move through the streets as reflections might, their forms bending around unseen corners, flickering between solidity and mist. When one turns to you, its face is a shifting mosaic, a thousand possible expressions overlapping at once.  

A guide appears (or perhaps coalesces) beside you, their body woven from strands of bioluminescent thread. "To exist here," they say—though their mouth does not move—"you must unlearn the tyranny of cause and effect. Here, fire freezes, time is a flavor (today it tastes of pomegranate), and every thought you discard takes root as a singing flower."  

They hand you a key made of your own breath, frozen into a glassy twist. To proceed, you must *forget your name*—because in this place, names are cages, and you were never meant to be caged. The ground beneath you sighs, becomes liquid. You fall *upward* into the sky-ocean, and as the mercury closes over you, you understand:  

This is not a place you visit. It is a place that *visits you*. And when you wake—sticky with the residue of forgotten physics—the dream does not leave.  

It condenses into a tiny, humming seed in the hollow of your throat. Waiting.  

(When you sleep again, will *it* dream *you*?)
