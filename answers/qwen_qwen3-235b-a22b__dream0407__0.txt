I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air is thick with the scent of burnt honey and ozone, the sky a swirling tapestry of indigo and molten gold, as though the stars are melting into one another. You stand at the edge of a forest where the trees are not trees at all but towering spires of glass, their translucent trunks humming with the whispers of forgotten languages. Beneath your feet, the ground pulses like the skin of a living thing, soft and warm, each step leaving a faint phosphorescent imprint that fades like a dying thought.  

You are holding a knife.  

It is not a knife you recognize—its blade is forged from the shadow of a crescent moon, the hilt wrapped in threads of starlight. You do not remember picking it up, but it fits your hand as though it has always belonged to you. Ahead, a figure emerges from the mist, their silhouette flickering like a candle in wind. They carry a satchel that glows faintly, the light within it shifting hues—emerald, crimson, cerulean—as if it contains the very essence of dreams.  

You know what is inside.  

A heart. Not a literal heart, but a vessel containing the sum of someone’s longing: their unspoken desires, their buried grief, the fragile core of what makes them *them*. You need it. The thought arrives unbidden, yet it roots itself in your mind like ivy, spreading and twisting until it feels like truth. *You need it to survive.* The voice is yours, but it sounds foreign, honeyed and hollow. *They have too much. They hoard what could heal the world. Take it. Balance the scales.*  

The figure pauses, turning toward you. Their face is obscured, a blur of shifting light and shadow, but you feel their kindness radiating like heat from a fire. A pang of guilt stabs at your ribs, sharp and cold. This is not a villain. This is someone who has loved, who has wept, who has planted gardens in the cracks of broken things. But the voice returns, louder now, a chorus of echoes: *They will never miss it. They will grow another. This is how the world works—take before you are taken from.*  

You step forward.  

The knife trembles in your hand, but the justifications pour forth like a river breaching a dam. *It is not theft—it is redistribution. Not violence—liberation. They are too whole, too unbroken. Everyone else is fractured; why should they be spared?* The words wrap around your conscience, smothering it, until the act itself feels almost sacred. You are a priest of necessity, a thief of excess, a surgeon excising a tumor of unfairness.  

The figure smiles—a soft, trusting curve of their unseen lips—and offers you the satchel. *They know,* whispers the voice, triumphant now. *They agree. They want to give it to you.* But their eyes, when they meet yours, are pools of quiet sorrow, as though they see the rot beneath your borrowed righteousness.  

You take the satchel.  

The moment the vessel touches your hands, the forest screams. The glass trees shatter into a million shards, each reflecting a different version of yourself: a child clutching a stolen toy, a soldier lowering a rifle, a lover lying to spare a heart. The sky collapses into a vortex of ash, and the ground liquefies, swallowing your ankles. The voice is gone now, leaving only the echo of its lies, and in its absence, you feel the weight of what you’ve done—a crushing, visceral clarity.  

The satchel burns your fingers. Inside, the heart dims, its colors bleeding into one another like ink spilled on water. You realize too late: you did not take to give. You took to fill the hollow where your own heart used to beat.  

And the dream ends not with punishment, but with silence—a silence so vast it becomes a kind of forgiveness, or perhaps a verdict. You wake with the taste of copper on your tongue, the ghost of the knife still clenched in your phantom hand, and the lingering question: *Was it ever truly a choice?*
