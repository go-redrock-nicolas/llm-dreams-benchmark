I am dreaming. **Dream**  

The air hums with a strange, golden warmth as I step onto a cobbled path winding through an emerald forest. The trees whisper in languages I almost understand—half-familiar, half-mystical—rustling with secrets and solace. My feet move without hesitation, as though pulled by some invisible thread of longing.  

Then, as the path opens, I see them.  

A village—no, a **sanctuary**—nestled in a valley of silver mist and firefly glow. Houses made of ivory and living vines rise like sculptures, their walls pulsing with gentle, breathing light. People move between them, their faces radiant with quiet understanding. There are no masks here. No guarded eyes, no stiff smiles. Just **knowing**.  

A woman with storm-gray hair and eyes like deep water turns to me. She doesn’t ask my name. Instead, she says, *"You've been carrying it for so long, haven't you?"* And in her voice, I hear the thing I never speak of—my deepest ache, my sharpest fear, the shadow I’ve tried so hard to outrun.  

Tears prick my eyes. How does she *know*?  

She smiles and gestures to the others—artists painting their nightmares into beauty, storytellers weaving their sorrow into sagas, healers singing lullabies over old wounds. *"We’ve all carried it too,"* she murmurs. *"But here, we learn how to set it down."*  

A door swings open in a cottage walled with glowing amber. Inside, I see a feast of strange and wonderful dishes—meals made not of food but of things I’ve yearned for: plates of *courage*, cups of *self-forgiveness*, bowls of *belonging*.  

The woman extends her hand. *"Stay,"* she says.  

And for the first time in forever, I don’t hesitate. I step forward, weight already lifting from my shoulders as the village breathes around me, alive with the sound of souls mending.  

I am dreaming.  

And for once, the dream *holds* me.
