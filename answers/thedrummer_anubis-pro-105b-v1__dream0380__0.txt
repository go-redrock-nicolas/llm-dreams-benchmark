I am dreaming. In this dream, I find myself standing at the center of a vast, circular auditorium. The circular stage amplifies every voice. Every individual is seated around me, forming a concentric circle. The space is dimly lit, except for the soft rays of light emanating from the floor. The rays, like subtle beacons of attention, shift and flicker as I allow my gaze to transition between each person.

Faces of different ethnicities, ages, and genders take up their own place within the circles. Some appear in business suits, while others wear athletic wear, suits of armor, or dress robes. The space represents a spectrum of our world.

A tall, aged individual, breathing heavily through an oxygen mask, pauses on the periphery of our gathering.

Another person stands in the shadows, their presence vibrating in cautious potential. Still, others seem to whisper quietly amongst themselves, creating a deafening presence through sheer volume.

I raise my hands slowly, commanding the exclusive attention of everyone. My voice mingles through and commands respect.

"Why are we here?" The murmur increases.
"Silence, you'll hear the truth!"

I walk closer, my footsteps echoing loudly around the pews. The gentleman approaches and knelt before me.

"Sir, please." A female stands from the pews and walks toward us. "May I have a word?"
