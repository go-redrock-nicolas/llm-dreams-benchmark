I am dreaming. (As you may know, words and visuals often intertwine in dreams.) 

I am floating down a river. The water is so clear, I can see all the way to the bottom, where fish dart and play among the reeds. I am in a small boat, and the sky above me is an impossible shade of blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. A gentle breeze whispers through the trees that line the riverbanks. 

As I drift, I notice that the riverbanks are made of shimmering gold. The sunlight dances on the surface of the river, creating patterns of light and shadow that seem to move like living things. 

Suddenly, the river begins to narrow, and the boat picks up speed. The banks on either side are now made of towering, jagged rocks. The boat moves faster and faster, threatening to tip over, and I cling to the edges, my knuckles white. 

The rocks suddenly give way to a waterfall, and I am plunged into an underground cave. The cave is lit by glowing crystals embedded in the walls. The light refracts through the water droplets in the air, creating a kaleidoscope of colors. I let go of the boat and float weightlessly, surrounded by the light and the sound of gently lapping waves. 

A voice echoes through the cave, as if from far away, "Welcome." The voice is soft and soothing, but it sends shivers down my spine. 

"Where am I?" I ask. 

"You are in the land of dreams," the voice answers. "You have been chosen to lead this world." 

"Lead this world?" I repeat, incredulous. "I have no experience." 

"Your qualifications are irrelevant here," the voice says. "You have qualities that cannot be learned in books or from teachers. You have a heart full of curiosity and wonder, and a mind that can see beyond the barriers of logic and reason. This world needs you to guide it." 

"What do you want me to do?" I ask. 

The voice grows silent, and I am left alone in the glowing cave. 

Suddenly, the cave begins to fill with water. The current is pulling me deeper and deeper, and I start to panic. I struggle to swim to the surface, but the water is too strong, and I am carried down into the darkness. 

The dream fades to black, and I wake up, gasping for air in my bed. 

As I lie there, sorting reality from the dream, I can't shake the feeling that there was something important about that voice. Like I had been chosen to do something, even if I didn't fully understand what it was yet.
