I am dreaming. *The air is thick with the scent of blooming jasmine, though no flowers are visible in the haze of this liquid-gray twilight. You stand in a cathedral of shattered mirrors, each fragment suspended in midair like a constellation of frozen raindrops. Your reflection splinters into a thousand versions of yourself — some taller, some bathed in starlight, others made of smoke. A low hum thrums through the ground as a procession of faceless figures materializes, their robes woven from moth wings that flutter soundlessly. They place a crown of liquid mercury upon your head, cool metal cascading down your temples like a baptism. "You've forged bridges between star systems without moving an inch," a chorus of crickets sings from the walls. Your hands tremble, suddenly heavy with the weight of keys you don't remember forging — iron ones dripping with moss, glass ones humming atonal melodies, a key shaped like the pause between heartbeats. The mirrors begin to bleed watercolor blues as you realize the achievement they praise is written in a language you taught yourself in childhood dreams, etched across your ribs in invisible ink. The crown dissolves into hymnbirds that fly through your chest, leaving hollow bones singing with unexpected grace.*
