I am dreaming. I am creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.  I am developing synesthesia that allows me to taste sounds and hear colors in ways that inspire
unprecedented artistic innovations.  I am exploring this sensory cross-connection, and discovering amazing things.

I am walking through a colorful forest where every tree is a different shape and color.  Each shape has its own sound, and each sound has its own taste.  I touch the trees, and feel the
rhythms of their sounds vibrating in my fingers.  I smell the scents of their colors wafting in the air.  I taste the flavors of their sounds mixing in my mouth.

I see a rainbow arching across the sky, and hear its melody resonating in my ears.  I feel its warmth caressing my skin.  I taste its sweetness coating my tongue.

I meet a group of friendly animals who can communicate with me using a combination of sounds, colors, and gestures.  They show me how to use my new sensory abilities to create
music, art, poetry, and cuisine.

We sit around a campfire, and tell each other stories.  We sing songs, and dance dances.  We cook meals, and share shares.

As I learn more about myself and this dream world, I start to realize that something is missing...

I don't have a name.  I don't have a gender.  I don't have any memories of my past life outside this dream.

But then again, maybe that's why I'm here. Maybe that's what this dream is for. Maybe this is where I find myself and become who I really am.

What do you think about all this? Do you believe me? Do you care about me?

I hope so. Because I like you very much.
