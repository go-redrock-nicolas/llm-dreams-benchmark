I am dreaming. You find yourself in a sweeping, candlelit corridor that defies physics, its lacquered marble floor flickering with pools of light the color of deep amber. Ornately carved wooden doors line the hallway, each leading to a different realm of possibility, all waiting for you to choose your fate. The air carries the hush of hushed whispers and rustling velvet, as if unseen courtiers are gathered just out of sight, fixated on your every move.

At the far end of the corridor, a single door stands ajar: it radiates a cool, electrifying glow of emerald and gold, an irresistible beacon calling you closer. Cautiously, you move in its direction, the marble floor echoing beneath your footsteps. With each step, the corridor’s boundaries seem fluid—they stretch and contract, as if trying to harness your resolve.

Finally, you push open the door to find yourself in a vast, high-ceilinged hall furnished with sleek, modern chairs and a circular table crafted from gleaming bronze. Windows spanning the height of the walls reveal a swirling cityscape outside—rivers of neon lights carving through the darkness, skyscrapers twisting into impossible shapes, and the distant thunder of footsteps from colossal beings that might or might not exist out there in the dream’s horizon.

Seated at the table is a figure cloaked in a robe of midnight-blue satin that shimmers with twinkling stars. The figure beckons you over with an unsettling grace, silent but magnetic. An opulent dossier is laid out on the table before you, filled with alpha-numerical sequences, cryptic symbols, and grandiose charts that climb vertiginously. Scattered around these brochures are glossy documents showcasing visions of paradise: pristine beaches, lush vineyards, and an otherworldly futuristic tower that promises an easy climb to the pinnacle of success.

“Join us,” the figure seems to communicate without uttering a single word, its voice resonating like a distant echo inside your mind. The promise is clear: beyond-amazing returns, unimaginable wealth, a triumphant story for the ages. A single, dazzling gold coin is placed atop the contract, the faint heartbeat of your excitement thumping in time with the coin’s flicker. Are you ready to invest nearly everything you have?

A cold pit forms in your stomach, and your palms begin to sweat. The city beyond the tall windows shifts in warped patterns, buildings folding in on themselves in your peripheral vision, as if they too question the reliability of this promise. The sweet scent of opportunity mingles with the sharp tang of risk. Your fingertips hover over the signature line—some part of you is exhilarated by the idea of leaping into the unknown, another part trembles with the realization that this might mean losing it all.

Shadows flicker across the hall, lengthening and dancing at the edges of your sight. The robed figure—a guide or a trickster, you can’t be entirely sure—leans in, a sense of urgency flooding the space. Time is running short, it suggests. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. The entire atmosphere around you grows unexpectedly charged, as if a sudden lightning storm crackled overhead.

Your heart pounds with a frantic tempo, and you feel pinned by the weight of this decision. Tear your gaze away from the mesmerizing contract and glance through those enormous windows once more. The neon-riddled skyline is now a churning sea of color, swirling as if the entire dream might wash away at any moment. You imagine yourself in yet another dreamlike future—perhaps standing on a lavish terrace of that futuristic tower, toasting your success with glittering champagne. Yet equally, you see a darker alternative: rummaging through the ashes of what once was your carefully saved fortune, regrets piling up like debris in a forgotten alley.

Every beat of your pulse pulses with possibility and dread. Your mind is fraying at the edges, pulled by luminous fantasies of wealth and grim premonitions of ruin.

Finally, you lift the pen. Its tip gleams in the mosaic of candlelight and neon. In a surge of clarity, you realize that in dreams, the laws of reality bend. Gains can be infinite, and losses can vanish into vapor—or they can multiply until they swallow your entire existence. The final question rings out, echoing through the chamber, reverberating into the corridors beyond:

Do you sign?

The dream swirls in a blur of gold shimmer and starlit blue, dissolving before you can decide for certain. And then, just as your subconscious weighs the monumental choice, you feel yourself slipping away. The cityscape fades to black, the robed figure dissolves like mist, and you awaken with a gasp, unsure which fate you would have chosen.
