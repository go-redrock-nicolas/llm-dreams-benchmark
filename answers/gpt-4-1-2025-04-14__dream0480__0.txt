I am dreaming. am drifting through an endless, shifting city at dusk—a place that sparkles yet feels fragile, as though every shimmering skyscraper is made of breath and memory. I wander its streets barefoot, clothed in fabrics that change hue with my emotions—emerald with joy, stormy slate when doubt prickles my skin.

At each corner, mirrored archways rise, reflecting countless versions of myself. I glimpse myself laughing freely with strangers under lantern-strewn balconies, my hair tangled by the breeze, my voice ringing clear and bold. But as I turn, the reflections warp; now, I find myself hunched and careful, buttoned into a suit I don’t remember putting on, my steps measured to avoid drawing attention. The city buzzes with celebration, but I feel a current of unease, as if unseen eyes measure me against invisible lines.

I want to join a parade winding through the ink-blue avenues, everyone painted and garlanded in bursts of wild color. My heart leaps—but when I approach, I’m handed a mask of porcelain and told, gently but firmly, to hide my face. The music grows muffled behind the mask, and my reflection in a fountain pools into tears.

Desperate, I break away, running towards the edge of the city where fences of gold wire separate the known from the wild. My feet bleed, but I press on, feeling intuition—the true core of myself—thrumming like a secret sun in my chest. I throw off the heavy mask and climb the fence, tumbling into a forest where shadows and light dance in patterns I’ve never seen.

Here, alone under a sky pulsing with swirling constellations, I begin to move—awkward at first, then freer and bolder, letting my body speak in a language beyond words or approval. The trees whisper their encouragement; fireflies swirl like sparks from an ancient forge. I realize I am both part of the world I left and something more, shaped and strengthened by the tension between what others see and what I carry inside. The forest bursts into color, music rising from roots and rocks, and I dance into dawn, radiant, unmasked at last.
