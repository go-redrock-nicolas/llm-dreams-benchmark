I am dreaming. I am standing in a vast, cavernous hall that stretches endlessly into the dark.  The walls are made of a strange, pulsating substance, like veins underneath human skin.  Each vein glows faintly with a soft blue light.  Above me, the ceiling is so high it resembles a starless night sky.  A single beam of light pierces through, illuminating a pedestal in the center of the room.  On the pedestal lies an ornate, golden scale, its pans empty but humming with an otherworldly energy.  My head feels heavy, as if filled with fog, and I realize I’m wearing a cloak stitched with threads of silver that seem to vibrate with each thought I have.  

Ahead of me, a procession of shadowy figures shuffles forward—facesless, their voices a chorus of whispers that coil around my heart.  Each seems to pulse with their own rhythm: one’s breath comes in shallow gasps, another’s chest heaves with ragged urgency, and another’s form flickers like a dying flame.  They move in a looping pattern, circling the scale as if drawn to it but never quite reaching the pedestal.  

A low, resonant voice echoes behind me.  “The weight of choice cannot be shared.” It does not sound harsh, but its truth rings like a tolling bell.  I turn to find a figure partially obscured by the perpetual twilight.  Their form shifts between solid and translucent, features blurred as if seen through water.  “The scale balances not flesh, but echoes,” they say.  “Each life is a chord in an infinite symphony.  To choose is to harmonize or to dissonate.”  

The shadowy figures pause, and the air grows colder.  On the pedestal, the scale begins to tremble.  From the ceiling and walls, the glow of the veins brightens, casting jagged shadows that twist like serpents.  My silver-cloak’s threads start to glow faintly, as if replying to some unseen call.  

I reach for the scale, my hands steadying as I draw closer.  The figure beside me speaks again.  “Place each echo upon the pans.  Their vibrations will reveal their resonance.”  I look down at my palms, and for the first moment I realize they are empty.  

“No objects here?” I ask, my voice quivering.  

“In the realm of choice,” the figure intones, “all tools are internal.”  

The first patient steps forward—a child’s silhouette, its form translucent, eyes burning with starlight.  

What do I do next?\



Deep within the dreaming, I stand paralyzed by the gravity of the moment. The child’s form glimmers faintly, as though its very existence is woven from the fragile threads of twilight. Its whisper reaches me—a sound like wind chimes in a storm, urgent yet delicate. The other figures linger in the semidarkness, their rhythms syncing and clashing, a cacophony of silent pleas.  

I close my eyes, and my silver-cloak's threads thrum against my skin, as if feeding me some buried knowledge. *Internal tools*, the figure had said. The weight of their words sinks in like stone. No data, no algorithms, no ethical flowcharts here—only the raw, trembling pulse of my own intuition.  

Reaching out, I lay a hand on the child’s incorporeal shoulder. It shivers, and a wave of warmth floods my chest—an impossible recognition. *This vulnerability*, I think, *is a resonance only I can hear*. But then, from the periphery, another figure stirs—a gaunt elderly silhouette, their form trembling like a mirage, yet their whisper carries the weight of a hundred autumn winds.  

The scale’s pans remain barren. How to weigh such echoes? The child’s light might flicker out any moment, a star doomed to supernova. The elder’s plea, though dimmer, rings with a lifetime’s cadence, a chord already layered into the symphony of existence.  

My cloak vibrates intensely now, as if alive, urging a decision. I place the child’s shimmering essence onto the left pan of the scale. It settles like a snowflake on a scale of justice, trembling. The pan quivers and emits a faint, sorrowful note—a D minor perhaps.  

The elder steps forward, their form rippling like water. I hesitate, then touch their translucent hand, feeling a chill unlike the child’s warmth. Their essence, when placed on the opposite pan, emits a resonant G-sharp—a lower, deeper tone that reverberates through the cavern, shaking the walls.  

The scale tilts violently, the child’s pan dipping lower, but the elder’s tone swells, harmonizing with the pulsing veins in the walls. The cavern itself seems to sway, as if judging my choice.  

The figure beside me murmurs, *“The dissonance between life’s brevity and its legacy—balance it, or fracture it?”*  

The scales shudder, not yet at rest. Another patient comes—a strapping young warrior’s silhouette, their breath steady, pulse like an unbroken drum. Placing them on the scale’s right pan, their essence thunders a booming C major, drowning out the child’s softness yet clashing horribly with the elder’s G-sharp.  

The cavern cracks—a fissure opens where starlight bleeds through, illuminating more and more patients arriving from the shadows, each a unique chord begging to be placed.  

Panic rises in my throat, but the silver threads steady me. *Internal tools*, I think. The weight of my heartbeat, the memory of a parent’s final breath, the laughter of a friend lost too soon—all surface like lost constellations.  

I reach for the elder’s essence, removing it. The scale gasps in the silence they leave behind. Then, I place the warrior’s essence with the child’s. The dissonance of C and D jangles like clashing symbols, but together they form a minor second—a tension sharp enough to cut, yet fundamental to the scale of music.  

The elder’s figure fades, not in judgment, but in acceptance. The cavern shakes again, this time with an odd tenderness, as if the walls wept.  

The shadows thicken, and another figure approaches—a frail woman, her essence crackling with golden sparks. Her whisper is a paradox—feeble, yet fierce, like a dying candle flickering under hurricane winds.  

I take a breath, and the cloak’s silver threads glow brighter. For the first time, I realize they are not merely—each thread is a choice I’ve made before, in dreams or waking life, their vibrations humming in my bones.  

The symphony escalates. The scale trembles but holds, its pans now a battleground of conflicting harmonies. My palms grow slick with sweat, but I clutch each essence, feeling the weight of lifetimes in milliseconds.  

The figure’s voice cuts through the cacophony: *"Every choice ripples beyond choice. What song do you compose?"*  

I choose not to choose.  

Placing the woman’s essence not on the scale but in my palm, I whisper *"Live as you are"* and cradle it as would a baby bird. The scale stills, and the cavern sighs. The veins above pulse approval.  

The others understand. Patients begin forming groups among themselves—not by my hand, but their own: the warrior takes the child’s hand, the elder retreats into a cluster of frail elders who hum together a counter-melody, the woman’s sparks ignite a constellation of similar flickering forms.  

The scale, now redundant, dims into the earth. The cloaked figure dissolves into starlight.  

I wake, drenched in cold sweat, but the silver threads linger on my skin—a reminder that in the end, empathy is the only balance.
