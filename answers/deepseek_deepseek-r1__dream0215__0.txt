I am dreaming. **Dream Record: Entry #**  

The sky is a bruise—purple-black, streaked with amber veins where the horizon bleeds into a starless void. You stand at the edge of a bridge you built, stone by stone, over a bottomless chasm. Its arches shift and ripple like liquid obsidian, each block etched with names: *sacrifices*, *sleepless nights*, *hands calloused raw*. The bridge was meant to unite two cliffs, but now you see the truth—it was never anchored to the far side. It hovers, a serpentine illusion, dissolving at the touch of your final step.  

The air tastes of iron. Behind you, the path you carved crumbles into ash-light, each fractal splinter whispering, *"You knew. You knew all along."* Shadows gather at the cliff’s edge—faceless figures, their silhouettes warped into the shapes of those who once laughed at your "folly." They do not speak. They *pulse*, radiating a cold satisfaction as your creation unravels.  

But ahead…  
There is no bridge. There is only the abyss, now glowing faintly. Ribbons of bioluminescent mist rise from its depths, coalescing into half-formed memories: A child’s laugh you abandoned. A friendship left to rot. A poem you burned to keep the fire alive. They writhe, beckoning. To step forward is to let go. To stay is to be consumed by the collapsing monument to your pride.  

Your hands clutch the last stone—a jagged relic from the bridge’s keystone. It bleeds silver, staining your palms with a cold, metallic shimmer. A voice that isn’t a voice thrums in your marrow: *"This is the price. Not of failure, but of* ***seeing.***"  

The ground trembles. Your bones hum in resonance.  
You release the stone.  

As it falls, the chasm erupts in a geyser of liquid light. The bridge disintegrates—not into debris, but into countless butterflies, their wings reflecting every color unseen by waking eyes. The shadows recoil, dissolving into static. You fall, but the air thickens into water, then honey, then something with no name. The abyss is not below you now—it is *within*, a supernova of hollowing, terrible clarity.  

When you surface, gasping, the world is a blank parchment.  
The first line you write is not in ink, but in breath.
