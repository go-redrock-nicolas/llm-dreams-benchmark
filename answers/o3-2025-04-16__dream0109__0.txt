I am dreaming. I am dreaming, and the dream remembers me first.  

I open my eyes into a world whose dawn rises downward.  Above my head, an abyss of honey-black sky yawns, while beneath my feet clouds swirl like incandescent milk.  Gravity is reversed here: planets hover like lanterns, tethered to nothing but the hushed awe of those who live below them.  The streets are not laid on the earth; they’re woven from braids of light that spool outward from every citizen’s heart.  Each pulse of emotion extends the roadway another shimmering meter, so the city is forever expanding with every joy, sorrow, and startled laugh.

Colors own the senses that words once ruled: indigo smells of iron and guitar strings; vermilion tastes like cracked pepper and old lullabies.  Sound, robbed of its usual home in the ear, now grows in the soil.  Farmers cultivate chords the way we cultivate wheat, harvesting D-minor at dusk when it is sweetest and most prone to minor key tangles.

Time itself is a liquid—visible, viscous, azure.  It sluices through gutter-veins that line each boulevard, pooling into fountains at the city center.  Years drip in luminous globules, and the citizens scoop handfuls to rinse yesterday from their faces.  To speak of the past here, one must literally carry it: I see children skipping along, pockets clinking with bright marbles of “five-minutes-ago” that they might one day trade for “tomorrow-morning.”

I learn quickly that logic is reflected like a mirror.  To prove a statement, residents begin with conclusion and unspool it into dazzling questions, seeking the root of their certainty rather than the branching evidence.  Debate is an art of graceful unraveling—whoever can coax the tightest certainty into the freest wonder wins.

My first day of integration begins at the Inversion Academy, whose doors are ceilings.  I step through by leaping upward, landing gently on what should be the underside of the marble arch.  A mentor named Cyrae guides me.  She converses by inhalation rather than exhalation: words tumble inward toward her lungs, and I must “listen” with my sternum, not my ears.  She teaches me to unthink so answers may bloom in the vacated spaces.

Lesson one: breathe the opposite of panic.  Here, fear is an anesthetic; courage, a dangerous stimulant.  To steady my nerves, I must cultivate a quiet terror, letting it seep through my pores like cooling mist.  Only then can my feet magnetize to the inverted streets.

Lesson two: walk backward to approach the future.  Each step toward a goal must be taken retreating, lest intent collapse the probability waves that streets of light rely upon.  I practice for hours, viewing my destination over one shoulder, knees bending in reverse choreography.

At sunset—technically sunrise, because the star descends from the zenith down into the horizon—Cyrae escorts me to the Council of Reversed Truths.  Its chambers are submerged beneath a lake of floating stone, the water hovering above us like a gleaming ceiling.  Councillors are draped in living equations: mathematical sigils that swim across their robes as silver minnows, rearranging into proofs that hum audibly.

To be granted residency, I must “forget” a memory offered by the Council.  They hand me a translucent cube containing someone else’s childhood—a thousand sunlit afternoons compressed into an ice-sugar prism.  I press it to my forehead.  It melts, and the memory becomes mine for an instant—warm sand, mango juice, a dog barking at eternally rising tides.  Then I must deliberately unremember it, letting the images trickle out of mind like sand through an hourglass turned skyward.  The Councillors nod, satisfied I can release as easily as I acquire.

Outside, festivals ignite across nocturnal clouds.  Fireworks descend from the ground, blossoming downward in slow, silken flares.  People gather on balconies beneath them, catching sparks in crystal nets to flavor tomorrow’s lullabies.  Musicians plant freshly harvested notes into amplifying soil, and melodies bloom like wildflowers.  I join a circle of strangers who are destined to become old friends yesterday.  We exchange laughter flavored with chalk and cinnamon—the taste of possible futures.

I lie that night on a bed stitched from midnight’s velvet, gazing up at the luminous oceans overhead.  Schools of starlight fish drift through the vast underside of the firmament.  The city’s pulse—roadways of heart-light—beats a gentle rhythm beneath me, cradling me in reciprocal gravity.  As I drift into sleep, I realize that integration is not the conquering of this civilization’s paradoxes but the surrender to its always-unfolding mystery.  Here, the fundamental law is wonder inverted, and I, a new citizen, learn to abide in unbounded astonishment.

I am still dreaming.  Or perhaps the dream is now awake, and I am the pleasant impossibility it is trying to understand.
