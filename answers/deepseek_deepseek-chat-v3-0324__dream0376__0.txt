I am dreaming. **The Dream:**

The sky is bruise-purple, swirling with slow, deliberate storms that crackle but never release rain. The air feels thick—like breathing through wet silk—and the ground beneath your feet pulses faintly, alive. You stand at the edge of a city carved from blackened marble, its spires jagged and sharp, scraping the underbelly of the clouds. The streets glow faintly, etched with phosphorescent veins of gold, as though the city itself is dreaming too.  

You can feel the others before you see them—shapes shifting at the edges of vision, their intentions a low hum against your skin. They don’t want to listen. They don’t want to yield. Their resistance is static in the air, a ripple of defiance.  

So you let your shadow stretch first.  

It uncoils from your feet like ink spilling in reverse, lengthening, deepening, swallowing the dim glow beneath you. The air chills where it moves, frosting glass and stone alike. Then the rage comes—controlled, surgical, honed to a blade’s edge. Your voice, when it leaves you, isn’t a sound but a vibration in the bones of the world:  

*"You will not deny me."*  

The words are not a request. They are a verdict.  

The resistance shatters. The others—figures of smoke and shuddering light—fold like paper in flame, collapsing inward, bending at the knees. Their fear is sweet, metallic, like distant lightning. You walk forward, and the city bends with you, spires bowing like grieving sentinels. The power thrums in your hands, liquid and electric. You don’t need to break them.  

You just needed them to remember what it meant to fear you.  

And oh—*they remember.*  

The dream shudders, pleased.  

Then you wake.
