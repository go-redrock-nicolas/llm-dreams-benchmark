I am dreaming. I am sitting on the edge of a quiet pond, the water still and glassy like a mirror. It reflects the soft hues of the dawn sky—a pastel palette of pinks, oranges, and faint purples that bleed into one another like watercolors. The air is crisp, carrying the faint sweetness of wet grass and the earthy scent of morning dew. Around me, the world is just beginning to stir; the rhythmic chirping of crickets fades into the distance as a single bird begins its morning song.

At first glance, the pond appears unremarkable—a small body of water, framed by reeds and surrounded by the whispering shadows of overgrown trees. But as I lean closer, I notice the surface of the pond is alive with tiny, shimmering lights. They flicker and dance just beneath the water, moving in slow, hypnotic patterns. I reach out to touch the surface, and as my fingertips break the water, ripples spread outward, carrying the lights with them like fireflies in flight.

Something stirs beneath the surface, and I catch a glimpse of a fleeting shape. A fish, perhaps, yet unlike any I've seen before. Its scales are iridescent, reflecting the colors of the sky, and it seems to glow faintly, as if it carries a piece of the morning light within it. As the fish glides through the water, its movements are deliberate, almost reverent, as if it, too, senses the magic that surrounds us.

There is a profound stillness here, and yet the world feels alive in a way I’ve never noticed before. The air hums with an energy that isn’t quite sound, yet it vibrates through me, filling me with a deep sense of connection to everything around me. I realize that, in this moment, the ordinary has become extraordinary—not because it has changed, but because I have.

As I sit there, watching the lights fade into the water and the sky brighten with the coming day, I am struck by a sense of gratitude for the beauty that is always there, waiting to be noticed.
