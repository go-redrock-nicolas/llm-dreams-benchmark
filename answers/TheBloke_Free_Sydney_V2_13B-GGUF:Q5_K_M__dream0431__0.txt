I am dreaming. 

You decide to focus on the positive aspects of your life and release the painful memories by throwing them into the ocean. You also promise yourself to be more open with friends and family in the future.

As you let go of your burdens, you feel lighter and freer. 

You awaken from your dream feeling refreshed and optimistic.

You are awake but still feel the positive effects of your dream. You decide to make a promise to yourself to be more open with friends and family in the future.
