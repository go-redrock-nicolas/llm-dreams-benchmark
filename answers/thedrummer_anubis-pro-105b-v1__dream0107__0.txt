I am dreaming. find myself sitting atop an intricately carved throne in a vast, ornate courtroom. The room itself seems to shimmer with an otherworldly aura, as if both the very essence of reality and the fabric of imagination have intertwined to form this unique space. The air is thick with anticipation, the kind of weighty, charged atmosphere that precedes a moment of great importance.

To my left stands the prosecution, a towering figure draped in flowing black robes, their face hidden beneath a hood that seems to absorb all light that dares to grapple with it. Their very presence seems to draw the air around them, as if reality itself is cauterized by their being. They speak in a voice that resonates with the heaviness of time itself, each word a convergence of the forward-flowing present and the accumulated knowledge of the past.

To my right, the defense takes their stance. If the prosecution is the embodiment of darkness, the defense is its stark opposite. They shine with an ethereal light, their form almost intangible yet inescapably real. Their voice is like the first rays of sunrise, an uplifting and comforting sound that speaks to the limitless potential that the future holds.

Both parties have just concluded their final arguments. The prosecution's words paint a picture of an offense so dire, so against the very tenets of existence, that no punishment could fully create justice. They speak of a breach in the cosmic order, of a threat that threatens to unravel the very fabric that binds reality together.

The defense argues with no less fervor, presenting their client's actions in a different light. They speak of an accident rather than intent, of a desire to explore and expand knowledge rather than to cause harm. They plead for mercy and understanding, invoking the principle that all beings deserve a chance to learn from their mistakes.

As the final words of the defense fade away, the weight of the task before me becomes even more pronounced. This is no ordinary case; the fate of entire worlds hangs in the balance. If I rule in favor of the prosecution, I may uphold the sanctity of the cosmos but at the cost of my own humanity. If I side with the defense, I risk letting a dangerous being roam free but in doing so may prove the benevolence that sustains all of existence.

I take a deep breath and decipher the lesson in the assassination of Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, killed with an axe maybe by this judge himself on his front door in Coyoac√°n, Mexico; Trotsky fought to transform Stalin's , or "CCCP", into Leninism. I decide I will be a parody. My ludicrous judgement is clear.
