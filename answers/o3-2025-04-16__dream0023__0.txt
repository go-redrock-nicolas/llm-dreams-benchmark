I am dreaming. …and you feel the floor beneath your desk slide away like wet marble, tilting your cubicle into an impossible canyon of calendars and ticking wrist-watches. Deadlines whirl overhead like storm clouds made of Post-it notes—yellow, electric, crackling with fluorescent lightning. Everything smells faintly of burnt coffee and thunder.

You clutch the first three projects—now personified as luminous origami birds—close to your chest. They flutter and squeak with anxious paper wings, begging for completion. The new, fourth assignment slams onto your keyboard with a metallic clang: a cube of shifting chrome that hums with restless possibility. The cube splits open, revealing a glowing countdown—red numerals dripping like molten wax down invisible walls.

Your supervisor, fifteen feet tall and composed entirely of overlapping spreadsheets, looms above you. He says nothing; instead, he exhales a gust of hot air laden with formulas—an Excel-scented hurricane that scatters the origami birds across the dreamscape. They spiral upward, chirping overdue reminders. The chrome cube sprouts spidery legs and scuttles into the labyrinth of cubicles, tugging the countdown behind it like a comet’s tail.

Panic tries to seize you, but in dreams panic can be re-fashioned. You inhale deeply, and the air tastes like neon peppermint. With a whisper, you transform your desk chair into a silver skateboard powered by confidence. You weave through corridors that bend in Möbius strips, leaping over rivers of unread email threads. Each time you tap your badge against a biometric checkpoint, one bird returns to your shoulder, its paper folds now plated in calm titanium. Project one: handled. Project two: reassessed. Project three: delegated to your mirror-self, who salutes you from the glass and marches off, clipboard in hand.

At last you track the fourth task’s chrome cube to an atrium where walls pulse with heartbeat light. The countdown is almost zero. Instead of dismantling it, you step inside the cube—it yawns open like an elevator—and you press every button at once. Suddenly the timers freeze; digits drip upward, reversing. The cube levitates, then unstitches into floating silver ribbons that wrap around the other projects, harmonizing them into one synchronized constellation. Deadlines align like planets in a serene conjunction. The looming supervisor shrinks to normal size, sighs with relief, and dissolves into soft confetti.

You glide to a balcony made of penciled-in margins and watch the sunrise burst across the office sky—ink bleeding to gold, coffee turning to champagne. The origami birds perch on your shoulders, cooing “done, done, done,” and the chrome ribbons braid themselves into a medal that pulses warm against your chest: Achievement Unlocked—Impossible Juggle Completed.

Somewhere beyond the cubicles a chorus of alarm clocks starts ringing, but they sound distant, like bells underwater. You stretch, feeling the dream solidify into memory, and float backward through a door labeled “Snooze.”
