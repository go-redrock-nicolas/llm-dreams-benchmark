I am dreaming. The air hums with a liquid violet light, thick as syrup but weightless, filling a room with no walls. Beneath my bare feet, the ground is neither warm nor cold—it thrums with a rhythm like a slow, wordless chant, resonating up through my bones. I open my mouth to speak, but my voice comes out as a swirl of silver smoke, coiling into shapes that dissolve before they can be understood. 

Across the shimmering emptiness, shadows move—not people, not creatures, but suggestions of beings whose edges blur like wet ink. They shift and sway, tethered to something unseen, pulsing in time with the low, subsonic vibration beneath me. My hands rise to my chest, pressing against a sensation swelling there—not pain, not joy, but something nameless, like the pressure before a storm, or the split-second pause between a question and its answer. 

I try to shape the feeling into a sound, a color, anything. The violet air shudders, and the smoke from my mouth twists into a flock of starlings, their wings flashing blue-black as they scatter. One lands softly on my palm. Its feathers are cold and smooth as river stones. It opens its beak and sings a single note—a frequency that resonates in my ribs, unlocking something deep and wordless. 

For a breath, I understand. The substance of the feeling is vast, an infinite tapestry woven from longing and memory and the scent of a place half-remembered, the aching beauty of a song you’ve never heard but know by heart. But the starlings dissolve into mist, and the knowledge slips like water through my fingers. 

The dream shudders. The light deepens to indigo, the rhythm quickens, and the unspoken thing inside me stretches, restless, still reaching for a name.
