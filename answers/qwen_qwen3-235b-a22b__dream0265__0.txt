I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air shimmers with the scent of burnt lavender and ozone, and the sky above is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, rippling and refracting light into impossible hues—colors that don’t exist in waking life, shades that hum like forgotten hymns. Beneath your feet, the ground is not earth but a mosaic of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a different version of yourself: a child clutching a compass, a shadow sprinting through a desert of clocks, a figure dissolving into ink. You step forward, and the mirrors sigh, rearranging into a path that coils like a serpent swallowing its tail.  

Your task is clear, though it was never spoken: reach the Citadel of Echoes, a spire of living crystal that pulses on the horizon, its song a low, resonant vibration in your bones. Your first strategy is logic. You sketch equations in the air with your fingers, each symbol glowing like molten gold, mapping trajectories through the shifting terrain. But the moment you commit to a path, the ground liquefies, swallowing your calculations whole. The mirrors fracture into a thousand screaming faces, and a chorus of whispers hisses, *“Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.”*  

Frustration claws at you. You try again—this time with instinct. You sprint, leap, climb, using your body as a compass, chasing the Citadel’s pulse like a heartbeat. But the landscape rebels. Gravity inverts. The sky becomes a floor of quicksand that drinks the stars, and you plummet into a cavern where time pools like water. Here, stalactites drip memories you’ve never lived: a lover’s face you can’t recall, a funeral in a language of birdsong, a tree that grows backward into its own roots. You drown in these borrowed seconds until a moth the size of a carriage wheel lands on your shoulder, its wings etched with equations you wrote in a past life.  

*Ah.*  

The pivot arrives not as a revelation, but as a surrender. You stop *solving* and begin *listening*. The Citadel’s song isn’t a riddle—it’s a duet. You kneel and press your palm to the mirrored ground. The shards stop squirming. They go still, becoming a map not of space, but of silence. You realize the path isn’t meant to be walked, but *unwalked*. You close your eyes and retrace steps you’ve never taken, moving backward through the labyrinth of your own choices. The moth hums, guiding you through corridors of forgotten “what ifs,” until you stand before the Citadel’s entrance—a door with no handle, only a question etched in its surface: *“What did you abandon to become you?”*  

You answer not with words, but by letting go of the compass, the equations, the need to conquer. The door dissolves. Inside, the Citadel is hollow, its walls lined with mirrors that reflect nothing. At its core floats a single seed, glowing like a collapsed star. You cradle it, and it blooms into a tree whose roots plunge into your ribs, whose branches cradle the moon. The dream shudders, and you wake with the taste of mercury and honey on your tongue, the echo of a song that insists, *“Begin again.”*  

And you know—this failure was the first note of a new melody.
