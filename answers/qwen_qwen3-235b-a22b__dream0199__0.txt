I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You fall—not through darkness, but through *color*. A cascade of liquid sapphire and molten gold rushes past your skin, humming with the resonance of distant chimes. When you land, it is not on earth, but on a surface that shimmers like the membrane of a soap bubble, yet holds you weightless, cradled by the breath of the wind itself. Above, the sky is a living tapestry: constellations of neon jellyfish drift through a violet firmament, their tendrils trailing stardust that rains down in slow-motion spirals, evaporating into whispers as they touch the ground.  

You think, *I want to fly*.  

Your feet lift, not upward, but sideways—gravity bends like a willow, and you sprint across the horizon, running *parallel to the sky*, your shadow casting light instead of swallowing it. Mountains rise beneath your footsteps, jagged peaks blooming into existence with each pulse of your heart. You leap, and the air thickens into stairs—steps of crystallized sound, each one shattering into a chord as you climb toward a sun that is not a sun, but a colossal eye, lidless and golden, blinking in slow, tectonic rhythms.  

You touch it.  

The world unravels.  

Suddenly, you’re submerged in an ocean without water. The pressure is silence, the depths filled with bioluminescent thoughts—ideas that swim like manta rays, their wings trailing equations and forgotten poems. Fish made of clock hands dart past, their scales ticking. You inhale, and the liquid of the void floods your lungs, yet it tastes of peppermint and nostalgia. A leviathan glides by, its body a collage of shattered mirrors, reflecting a thousand versions of yourself: one weeping, one crowned in flames, one dissolving into crows.  

You think, *I want to understand*.  

The ocean becomes a library. Endless shelves spiral into infinity, each book bound in flesh, its pages veins. You open one—*your own childhood memory*—and the scent of rain on pavement floods your senses. A paper boat floats out, carrying a miniature version of you, eyes closed, dreaming this very moment. You reach to touch it, and the library combusts into moths, each insect glowing with the text of a forgotten wish.  

You follow them.  

They lead you to a desert where the sand is made of shattered pianos. Each grain hums a note, and your footsteps compose a symphony that shifts the dunes into shifting cities—towers of bone, bridges of smoke, fountains that spray liquid time. You drink from one and see your death: not an end, but a door, opening into a garden where all your lost things grow—keys, words, hours, a cat you once buried beneath a willow.  

A figure approaches, stitched from shadows and starlight. It has no face, only a mirror. You stare into it and see not your reflection, but a wolf, a galaxy, a child laughing in a field of static. The figure speaks without sound: *“This is your mind. This is the world. Which will you change first?”*  

You open your mouth to answer—but the dream shudders. The sky cracks like an egg.  

You wake, gasping, the taste of stardust on your tongue, the echo of infinite selves thrumming in your bones.
