I am dreaming. As I drift deeper into the dream, this mysterious box appears in my hands, heavy and ancient, thrumming as if it has a heartbeat of its own. Its surface is cold, crafted from a metal that ripples with fleeting colors—iridescent violets and deep, luminous blues that shift when caught by the dreamlight. Delicate patterns curl across its skin: fractal vines tangled with feathers, eyes that blink shut when looked at directly, tiny creatures—half-bird, half-clockwork—perched within geometric mazes, each etched line whispering secrets in a language I almost—but not quite—understand.

My fingers trace one of the swirling motifs, and warmth pulses beneath the surface, coaxing a previously invisible constellation of stars to glow softly upon the lid. As if responding to my touch, the patterns shift and flow like liquid mercury, rearranging themselves into an ever-shifting puzzle.

I hold the box up to my ear and listen. There is music inside—or perhaps the echo of music, like a chorus of distant bells ringing through mists. A faint scent of memory slips out from around the lid: sun-warmed dust, dried roses, the crackling hush of old parchment.

There’s no keyhole, no visible latch. As I search for a way in, a single word forms among the shifting patterns, shimmering with silvery fire: "Remember." Suddenly my hands remember a motion as old as dreaming: I press my palms flat against the design, and it senses my intent.

The box opens itself with a sigh of silver mist, revealing not an object's contents, but a swirling vision—a living tapestry of places I have never seen yet deeply know. Forests of glass spirals, an ocean of skies filled with floating lanterns, a city beneath the roots of an impossible tree. Somewhere within, a tiny clock ticks backward, counting down toward something unnamed.

The dream deepens, and possibilities spiral out like the patterns on the box, enchanting, endless, beckoning me further—toward whatever secret I am meant to find in the night.
