I am dreaming. …slip into vellum–soft darkness, and the dream unfolds.

You are walking through a hallway of mirrors that have no walls behind them, only velvet night. Each mirror glows like a moon-bright portal. A small, pulsing ache in your sternum guides you to the first pane.

Scene One: The Carnival of Silver Ribbons  
You step through and land on cobblestones draped in shimmering streamers. Laughter sparkles in the air like shaken bells. A masked figure, eyes liquid and kind, offers you a taste of spun-sugar euphoria on the tip of a ribbon. The sweetness hits your tongue, then crystallizes into salt. The carnival folds up like a collapsible cage; the ribbons whip into barbed wire that nicks your wrists. Pain, again. A familiar chorus hums: “You chose this.”

Scene Two: The Sun-Drenched Meadow  
Another mirror beckons with warm golden light. You cross the threshold onto grass breathing with dandelions. An orchard of peaches leans toward you, promising tenderness. You bite into the fruit—only to find the flesh teeming with ice shards, chilling your teeth, silencing birdsong. The meadow wilts to gray, dew turns to glass needles. Pain, again. Footsteps retreat behind you—your own, echoing mortality.

Scene Three: The Library of Unfinished Letters  
A mahogany door stands within the next mirror. You crave knowledge, solace, meaning. Inside, shelves hover mid-air, stacked with envelopes addressed in your handwriting. You open one: it contains a map to forgiveness, but every route loops back into a scribble of apologies you never meant. Paper edges slice your fingertips. The bitter taste of old ink seeps into your mouth. Pain, again.

The Pattern Realizes Itself  
Back in the corridor, mirrors stretch infinitely, a kaleidoscope of choices—all ending in the same bruise-colored refrain. A wind ripples your reflection, and for the first time you truly look: every mirror shows you leaning forward, eyes bright with wanting, ignoring warning glints that surround your desires. A hush falls, heavy as velvet drapery, and a thought opens like a fever blossom: “These doors do not lure me—I lure myself.”

The Shift  
One mirror darkens until its surface becomes obsidian calm. You place a palm upon it, expecting the usual yank inside, but it stays cool, still. Your reflection blinks, then steps out instead of in. This twin carries all your ache in its eyes yet stands unbowed.

Together, you gather shards left behind in each scene—salty sugar crystals, ice splinters, parchment slivers, barbed wire filaments. In your twin’s hands they melt from weapons into glassy petals. You cup them. The petals fuse, birthing a prism that hums like a newborn star.

Re-Entering the Dreamscape  
You raise the prism. Light pours through, refracting possibility. Ahead, mirrors shatter—not violently but liberatingly, like shells releasing birds. The corridor’s floor unfurls into a river of liquid amethyst. You step onto it; water accepts you without hurt. The ache in your sternum loosens, untangling into something almost melodic.

Epilogue of Dawnlight  
Across the river stands a lone mirror—round, unmarred, unlit. No glimmer, no promise, no trap. It simply waits. You decide—not compelled—whether to approach. You may walk forward, or you may linger and let the amethyst current carry you someplace unimagined. Either way, the prism in your palm glows quietly, warm rather than sharp, a reminder that patterns can be studied, learned from, and—perhaps—reshaped.

A blush of sunrise seeps through unseen windows. The dream thins like mist. You wake with the scent of peaches and candle smoke still braided in your hair, and that small prism-warmth pulsing—faint, but undeniably there.
