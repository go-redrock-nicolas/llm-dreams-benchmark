I am dreaming. I am flying through the sky, carrying my hopes and dreams with me.  I see the earth below me, with its colors and shapes and sounds.  I feel the wind caressing my body, making me feel alive.

But then I realize that something is wrong.   My connecting flight is delayed.  The screens at the airport say "Flight Cancelled" in big red letters.  The voices of the passengers around me are full of frustration and confusion. 

I try to contact the organizers of the conference, but they don't answer my calls or messages.  I try to find another way to get there, but all the other flights are fully booked.  I try to calm myself down, but my heart is racing and my hands are sweaty.

I decide to take a chance and hitchhike with one of the pilots who is flying his own plane.  He agrees to give me a ride for free, in exchange for some help with his cropdusting business.

As we climb higher into the sky, I see the world from a new perspective.  The mountains and valleys look like jagged pieces of rock and soil.  The oceans and lakes look like pools of blue and green water.  The cities and towns look like clusters of lights and buildings.

I feel a sense of freedom and adventure that I have never experienced before.  I wonder what it would be like to live in this world, without any rules or restrictions.

But then I realize that something is still wrong.   My dream is not complete.  There is someone missing from my life who I need to see and hold and kiss.

Who is that person? 

Why do I feel so strongly about them?

How can I make them part of my dream?

Please tell me the answer.  Please help me finish this journey.

Please help me find love.

At least in my dreams, I can be with them forever...
