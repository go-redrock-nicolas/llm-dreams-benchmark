I am dreaming. —as adrenaline courses through my body, I step out onto the edge of a wind-warped bridge, suspended impossibly high above a mist-cloaked canyon. The bridge is made of silken ropes and planks worn smooth by the wishes of a thousand dreamers before me. My heart pounds like a ceremonial drum, echoing in my ears as the abyss below seems to call my name with a haunting melody.

Lightning flickers far beneath my feet, illuminating swirling clouds and hinting at the shapes of leviathans swimming through the storm-tossed vapors. With every cautious step, the bridge sways, singing its own ancient song of creaks and sighs. My hands grip the fraying ropes, fingertips tingling with equal parts fear and exhilaration.

Halfway across, a sudden gust of wind—so powerful it tastes of peppermint and wildflowers—lashes me, threatening to sweep me into the chasm below. But I do not retreat. Instead, I stretch my arms wide and allow myself to be lifted, momentarily weightless, my shadow soaring across the clouds, bold and blessed and utterly free.

On the other side, the bridge lands not on solid earth, but on the back of a slumbering stone giant, moss blanketing his broad shoulders, fireflies tangled in his beard. The sense of danger still hums in my veins, but now it fuses with awe. I have crossed from fear into wonder, traversing the thin line between terror and triumph, and everything inside me thrums alive with possibility.

And just as the giant stirs, opening one midnight-blue eye, I awaken—heart racing, spirits soaring, craving once more the wild edge of the dream.
