I am dreaming. Let me see... Ah, here we go. I'm standing in a field of luminescent grass that shimmers in hues of silver and electric blue. The sky overhead is a swirling vortex of stars, each one pulsing like a tiny heartbeat. In the distance, there's a... structure. Wait, no—it's a tree, but not any ordinary tree. Its trunk is translucent, like the glass of church windows, only instead of stained glass designs, there are shifting scenes of my life: moments when I’ve felt truly alive, moments of failure, moments of quiet triumph. Each memory ripples across the bark, glowing softly. I feel drawn to it. When I reach out, the branches move slowly, tentatively, like they're thinking about how to respond to my presence. The air smells like rain and cinnamon. There's a voice—or is it many voices?—humming a melody that seems familiar but distorted, as if heard through water.

Wait, now the tree is... changing. The trunk is splitting open, revealing a labyrinth of glowing pathways inside. Each path is lined with mirrors, but not ordinary mirrors. They show not my reflection but choices I haven’t made, paths I could’ve taken. One mirror shows me as an older version of myself who abandoned the goal entirely, now living as a reclusive writer in a cobwebbed tower. Another mirror flickers with a version where I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams, standing on a stage accepting a golden... something that isn’t quite real. A third path—oh god—shows me stuck, forever looping through the same disappointment, repeating the same mistakes decade after decade.

I reach toward the "success" mirror, but my hand passes through it, leaving a trail of glittering dust. The branches shudder, and the tree emits a sound like wind chimes made of crystal. A path materializes beneath my feet, warm and spongy, leading deeper into the tree. The air grows colder; the light shifts to purple. I hear a sound—a whisper that says, "What does your heart yearn for more: the trophy, or the journey?" The question echoes but morphs into a mantra after each repetition. The ground begins to dissolve, but instead of falling, I’m rising, spinning upward through the cosmos. The stars unravel into threads that wrap around me like safety harnesses. A figure emerges—translucent, made of starlight and shadow. It gestures toward a door floating in space, ornate with carvings of my fears and a single word: Proceed. 

I open the door. Behind it is a room filled with thousands of hourglasses, each one holding a different colored sand. But none of them are turning. The sand is suspended in midflow. The translucent figure points to one at my height—a glowing amber one. Inside it, I see my face, tears streaming down, but smiling. The act of watching shakes something loose; a single grain moves. Then another, and another, until the entire chamber vibrates with the sound of a thousand sands shifting. The ground beneath me solidifies again, and I’m back in the field, the tree gone. The grass now pulses with a stronger light, and somewhere in the distance, I hear a clock tower chime, but there are ten chimes, though I’ve never seen such a tower. My hands are still dusted with stardust, and my resolve feels... different. Lighter. Or maybe just truer.
