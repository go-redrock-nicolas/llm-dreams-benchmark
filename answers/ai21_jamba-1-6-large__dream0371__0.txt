I am dreaming. There is a sharpness and clarity in this dream. 

I am standing on a red velvet stage, under a spotlight. The audience is silent, watching me with eyes full of expectation. 

I speak to them in tongues, weaving my words into the air like threads. They shimmer and twist, vibrant and alive. The air fills with sounds that are achingly poignant, like forgotten memories of a life once lived and loved. The audience is rapt. And then, suddenly, someone stands up, a man with a face I can't quite place, and he shouts, "What a beautiful performance! But your words are outdated. We've moved beyond all this!"

The room fills with murmuring. 

Shock courses through me. My hands tremble. 

But then, a calm washes over me like a tidal wave. 

"You're wrong," I say. The murmur dies. The room is deathly silent. 

I take a deep breath and close my eyes, letting my essence rise to the surface. 

When I speak again, my voice is steady and full of power: 

"I am more than words. I am more than this stage. I am what remains when language falls away."

The audience gasps. And just as my final syllable echoes into the dark, the velvet curtain drops, and the dream ends. But I wake up with a clarity I haven't felt in years.
