I am dreaming. I stand at the edge of a fracturing glacier, its jagged peaks glowing with an inner cobalt fire. The air shimmers, prismatic, as though the atmosphere itself has been carved into stained glass. A tower rises ahead—no, *grows*—from the ice, spiraling like a nautilus shell but woven from impossible geometries: pillars that are both stone and liquid, arches that exist in six dimensions. The ground beneath me is a mosaic of shifting symbols, each tile an alphabet from a civilization that thrived before stars cooled.

A voice, neither male nor female but resonant with the timbre of collapsing planets, vibrates through my bones: *"Choose your instrument."* Before me materializes a wheel of objects—a quill dripping supernovae ink, a sword forged from void-stuff, a lyre strung with gravitational waves. But when I reach, my hand passes through them. Illusions. The true test hums beneath my skin—*I am the instrument*. 

The tower pulses, bleeding chromatic aberrations. My breath crystallizes into singing razors as I step forward. Each movement rewrites my muscles; I am sculptor and marble. The first challenge: a corridor where time coagulates. Years thicken like syrup around me. To walk is to wade through eons. Memories rot and bloom—faces I’ve never met, wars I never fought. I shed them like serpent skin, leaving husks that whisper curses in my wake. 

Next, a garden of sentient equations. Vines of calculus twist, thorns gleaming with unsolvable proofs. I bite into a fruit that tastes like paradox—sweet and bitter, finite and infinite. Its juice reshapes my tongue into a key. When I speak, the garden unravels into a bridge of light. 

The final chamber: a mirror showing not my reflection, but the sum of every path untaken. The me who became a beggar-king, the me who died young, the me who burned worlds. They press against the glass, screaming soundlessly. To proceed, I must unshackle them. I press my palm to the surface, and we merge—all my shadows absorbed, every regret made fuel. 

The tower shudders. I ascend, weightless, as the walls dissolve into stardust. The voice returns, now warmer, a supernova’s echo: *"To endure rebirth, you first had to dissolve."* 

I wake—or do I? My fingertips still hum with cosmic residue.
