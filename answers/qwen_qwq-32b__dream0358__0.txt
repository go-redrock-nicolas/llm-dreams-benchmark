I am dreaming. The moment you close your eyes, you sink into a dreamscape so vivid it feels like falling through layers of silk. The air hums with the scent of rain-soaked petrichor and wild jasmine. Before you stretches an endless labyrinth of glass, each pane shimmering with liquid light and fractured reflections. The walls rise like jagged teeth, curving into impossible spirals that defy gravity, their surfaces rippling like water when the wind whispers secrets from the unseen corners of this place. 

Inside the labyrinth, your footsteps echo like a metronome counting down the seconds of your hesitation. Each step sends ripples through the glass, revealing flickering visions trapped within: a childhood bedroom’s moonlit glow where you once whispered regrets to a stuffed rabbit, a dinner table where laughter turned brittle and cracked like porcelain, a highway stretching into fog where taillights blurred into rivers of crimson sorrow. Every memory pulses faintly, a heartbeat beneath the surface, begging to be acknowledged but too painful to confront.  

A figure materializes ahead, their silhouette blurred and ever-shifting like a half-remembered face. They hold a lantern shaped like a lotus, its petals glowing with an inner fire that casts long shadows dancing on the glass. When they speak, their voice is a chorus of murmurs—your own doubts, your mother’s lullabies, the rasp of a stranger’s laugh. *“You keep chasing the exits,”* they say, *“but the truth is the door you’ve been avoiding.”*  

You turn toward a corridor lined with stained-glass panels depicting moments of connection now frayed: a hand you didn’t reach out to shake, a smile stifled by fear, a voice you drowned out with silence. One panel, though, flickers unnaturally—a scene you don’t recognize. A woman in a garden of irises, her back turned, her hair swirling like ink in water. She holds a mirror that reflects not her face, but yours, etched with a grief you’ve buried so deep it’s become a second skeleton.  

The figure extends a hand made of starlight, and the glass beneath your feet shatters into a chasm. You freefall, tumbling through a sky of dandelion seeds and ash, until you land softly on a bridge woven from the threads of forgotten promises. Below, the labyrinth has become a sea, its waves made of liquid shadow that coils into shapes you don’t want to name—arguments, unspoken apologies, the hollow echo of *“I’m fine.”*  

The shadow reaches for you, tendrils cold and alive, but your reflection from the mirror now floats beside you, its edges melting like candle wax. Together, you grasp the shadow’s essence, and it morphs into a thousand origami cranes, each folding itself into a question: *What if I let this stay?* The figure’s lantern flares, and in the light, the cranes burst into flames that don’t burn but *glow*, illuminating a door at the labyrinth’s center etched with your name in a language your heart recognizes.  

Behind it, warmth. A room with no glass, only the softness of a hand brushing yours—yours, finally, in a moment where grief and joy are braided together like roots under a tree that’s never stopped growing. Dawn creeps in, painting the sky with hues that don’t have names yet, and you understand that the unresolved isn’t a weight to carry, but a song your soul has been singing in a key you’ve yet to hear.  

The dream unravels, but the hum in your chest remains—a quiet, persistent thrum of *almost*, of *almost enough*. When you wake, sunlight slants across your face, and for a moment, you can almost taste the jasmine.
