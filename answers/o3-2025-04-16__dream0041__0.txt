I am dreaming. …and I gasp awake inside the dream—though my body never moves—because the auditorium I’m about to walk onto is levitating in a midnight-blue sky stitched together from constellations I’ve never studied.  

Rows of experts wait for me on terraces of polished obsidian, their silhouettes haloed by floating nameplates that flicker like nervous fireflies: “Dr. Arcanum,” “Prof. Axiom,” “Chief Curator of Forgotten Laws.” Instead of faces, each expert wears a luminous hourglass where eyes should be, grains of silver sand tumbling downward in unnervingly perfect silence.

The task I’m scheduled to perform? To weave a single, flawless ribbon of music—visible music—by coaxing light out of a glass harp the size of a cathedral organ. I can almost feel the instrument’s cold crystal keys beneath my fingertips even though I haven’t taken the stage. My breath fogs the air with sparks of opal, betraying how frightened I am.

Minutes tick away—though in this suspended dream-sky, “minutes” feel like origami cranes folding and unfolding over my head. Prepared? My mind is a half-finished constellation at best. I’ve practiced in dim echoes and corridors of memory, never before an audience whose very gazes sculpt the fabric of reality.

A door made of mirrored water irises open. I step through—and the stage greets me as if it, too, is alive. Columns of moonlight rise and drift like incandescent kelp; a hush washes over the crowd, the way tides crawl over secret beaches. Somewhere far below, thunder rumbles, yet no storm exists.

“Begin,” intones a voice, not human—perhaps the dream’s own heartbeat.

Panic bubbles up. My sheet music, once tattooed across my memory, scatters into a flock of translucent ravens. I chase them with my thoughts, trying to re-ink the melody, but they vanish beyond the proscenium’s edge.

I lay shaking hands on the crystal keys. The harp responds with a sympathetic tremor, and prisms of color swarm around my wrists. When I press the first chord—wrong, painfully wrong—the note tears itself into shards of amethyst and falls into the void. Gasps ripple through the audience; hourglasses flash crimson. My knees threaten to fold.

“Remember the hinge,” whispers a second voice, quiet as parchment turning. It isn’t mine; it may be the dream’s memory of my childhood teacher, or the glimmer of courage buried in my ribs. “Time is pliable here. Bend it.”

I inhale until my lungs feel like they’re inflating with liquid dawn. I picture every rehearsal, every imperfect scale, every accidental harmony that once made me deliriously curious rather than afraid. I feed the memory—freshly polished—into the keys.

This time when I strike, the note erupts not in shards, but in ribbons of sunrise-gold. They curl above me, painting sound across the dome of night. Another chord: a spout of emerald. Another: a spiral of vermilion mist. The harp thrums like an awakened leviathan, and I, previously unprepared, become the tether between wonder and structure.

The experts’ hourglasses slow. One even reverses, sand shimmering upward as if surprised. I realize I’m conducting not only music, but time itself; each correct interval re-stitches the frayed fabric of the dream. The ravens of lost sheet music return, perching on invisible bars of starlight, notes re-forming on their wings.

Soon the entire firmament dances with chromatic rivers. The obsidian terraces bloom into crystalline gardens; the experts set down their impassive judgments, their hourglasses tipping to cradle blossoms of sapphire wind. My fear melts into a jubilant roar of colors.

At the climax, I release a final chord—pure white, devoid of hue yet holding all hues inside it. It gathers the other ribbons into a colossal vortex, a flower in reverse. Then, silence—with an aftertaste of forever.

The experts rise. They bow—not because I was flawless, but because I bent impossible uncertainty into a moment of meaning. I bow back, surprised to find my hands no longer trembling.

The sky-auditorium dissolves into cascading feathers of light. As I tumble weightlessly through them, I hear the same parchment whisper at my ear: “Remember this when you wake—the unprepared heart is just one breath away from brilliance.”

And with that, the dream exhales, and I drift back toward waking, still humming the invisible melody that turned fear into aurora.
