I am dreaming. - \\

The air is thick with the scent of burning incense and damp earth as I stand atop the Stone of Echoes, a massive obsidian monolith that hums with latent energy beneath my bare feet. To my left sprawls the Skyborn Empire—their floating citadels drifting lazily among the clouds, adorned with banners of iridescent feathers that shimmer like shattered rainbows. Their delegates hover just above the ground on discs of solidified light, their elongated silver fingers gesturing in intricate patterns as they argue in a tongue that sounds like wind chimes and thunder.  

To my right, the subterranean clan of Vaal’Reth emerges from the earth itself, their obsidian armor glistening with molten veins. Their leader, a towering figure with eyes like smoldering coals, kneads the hilt of a blade forged from a fallen star. The ground trembles as they speak in guttural echoes, their words carrying the weight of centuries-old grudges buried deep beneath mountains.  

Between them, I feel the fragile thread of understanding unraveling. The Skyborn accuse the Vaal’Reth of stealing the Celestial Tear, a gem said to hold the essence of the first dawn. The Vaal’Reth sneer, claiming it was rightfully unearthed from the depths where their ancestors entombed it ages ago.  

Desperation claws at me—until I remember the legends whispered by both sides. The Tear does not belong to either. It is a seed.  

Raising my arms, I channel the monolith’s resonance. My voice amplifies into a roar that silences the heavens and stills the earth. **"You seek to claim what was never meant to be held!"** I press my palms to the Stone, and its surface fractures, revealing a blinding fissure. **"The Tear yearns for the sky and the soil—to bridge them."**  

With a pulse of will, I hurl the gem upward. It shatters midair, and from its fragments erupts a colossal tree, roots plunging into the bedrock while its branches pierce the clouds. Golden sap rains down, knitting wounds—both old and new—as the two civilizations gasp in awe.  

War dissolves into whispers. The Skyborn lower their luminous discs. The Vaal’Reth sheathe their star-blades. And I—mediator, fool, dreamer—watch as the first leaves unfurl, each one etched with a prophecy neither side had dared to read.  

*Only the bridge remembers the way home.*  

The dream begins to fray at the edges, but the tree remains, its shadow stretching across time itself.
