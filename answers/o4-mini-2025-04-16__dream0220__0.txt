I am dreaming. I find myself drifting through a twilight forest whose trees glow with molten silver sap, their leaves whispering in harmonies I almost recognize. The air is thick with a sweet spice that clings to my tongue like honey warmed by sunlight. Somewhere off to my right, a cluster of graceful, lantern-eyed creatures plays a harp fashioned from spider-silk and luminescent petals. With each pluck of a string, their music ripples through the air, causing the ground beneath me to pulse in soft, slow waves.

A slender path of violet stones leads onward, and I follow it until I emerge onto a broad plaza lined with towering mirrors. Reflected in each glassy surface is a slightly different version of myself: one with wings of blue smoke, another with hair spun from starlight, a third wearing a coat of living moss that breathes in time with my heartbeat. As I step forward, a hush falls, and I sense a presence gathering around me.

From the edges of the plaza glide the members of this society—tall, elongated figures dressed in fractal-patterned robes. Their eyes are slits of polished obsidian, and where human hands would be, they have six-fingered appendages tipped in iridescent claws. These beings bow deeply, but it’s not the courteous bend I know. It’s an almost imperious lean, their spines curving gracefully toward the ground, heads held high. To return the gesture properly, I must arch my back and thrust my chin upward, as if daring the sky to challenge my gaze. I do so, heart pounding, and they chirp softly between clicking breaths, a sound of delighted approval.

One of them—taller than the rest, crowned with a ring of floating luminescent motes—approaches and blows a soft, resonant honk directly into my ear. In this culture, the honk is their highest greeting, a sign of deep respect. My instinct flinches because in waking life a sudden honk startles or offends, but here it is sacred. Mustering courage, I offer my own version: a low, gurgling rumble in my chest that shakes the plaza’s mirrored walls. It is awkward, off-key, but the crowd bursts into a chorus of ticking applause, and the air shimmers with approval.

They invite me to sit at their long, earthen table where feasting begins. But what they cherish as etiquette I find baffling: when they pass dishes, I must thrust my empty bowl forward with force, almost slapping it against their serving plates, rather than holding it respectfully. I do so hesitantly; the first time my bowl clatters so loudly everyone jumps. Then they cheer, clapping their claws together in a tribal rhythm. Encouraged, I grip my bowl more firmly next time, and the sound resonates like a gong. They lean back, satisfied—this rhythmic crash is apparently the highest compliment I can offer to their cook, a giant creature with marble skin and velvet stripes, whose tiny eyes glitter in serene pride.

Between courses, they engage in conversation by coughing into their hands and releasing a spray of pearlescent dust mid-sentence. That dust is their laughter, their tears, their applause. I realize too late that I should cough deliberately, but I remain silent. The gathering’s murmur dims momentarily. Guilt curls in my chest—but then, the moted leader leans close and emits a sustained, low-frequency belch. It reverberates through me like a warm breeze. “Join us,” the belch seems to say. Trembling, I clear my throat and give my best imitation of a regal belch, low and measured. Immediately, petals unfurl from the trees overhead, and the plaza brightens as though dawn has broken. I am embraced.

As the feast reaches its crescendo, they present me with a gift: a translucent orb that glows with every color I’ve ever felt—joy, fear, wonder. To accept it, I must gently toss it upward and allow it to drop back into my open hands, rather than cradling it tenderly. My first toss is too timid—the orb plinks pitifully against the stone, but on the next try I hurl it confidently skyward, watching it arc like a tiny sun before returning to rest in my palms. The crowd’s claps sound like rain pattering on glass.

In that moment, I realize I’ve found a way to be true to myself while honoring their ways—by lending them the one thing they prize most: unguarded boldness. As I stand there, orb glowing warmly between my hands, the mirrored walls dissolve into mist. The violet-stone path winds back into the forest of silver trees, their sap dripping starlight onto my feet. The creatures with the spider-silk harps resume their melody, and I know that even when I awaken, a piece of this reversed world—its glimmering rules, its strange courtesies—will pulse forever at the edge of my memory.
