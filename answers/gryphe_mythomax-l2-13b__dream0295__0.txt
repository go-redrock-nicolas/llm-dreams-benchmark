I am dreaming. I find myself standing alone on a misty cliff overlooking the ocean. The sky is dark and full of stars, and the air is thick with emotion. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the fog below. It is someone who caused me significant hurt in the past, someone I thought I'd never see again. As they approach, I can see the pain etched into their face, and they slowly raise their arms in supplication.

"I know I did you wrong," they say, their voice hoarse with emotion. "I never meant to cause you so much pain. Please, forgive me."

Tears sting my eyes as I stare at them, still unable to comprehend the depth of their remorse. They continue to speak, recounting every aspect of their transgression and describing how much guilt has plagued them over the years. Their sincerity is palpable, and despite my lingering hurt, I begin to feel a shift within myself.

As the waves crash against the jagged rocks below, I recognize that the severity of their actions does not define who I am or what our relationship could become. Slowly, I extend a hand towards them, and they grasp it tightly, their grip as strong as their apology.

"I don't know if I can forgive you," I say, my own voice trembling. "But I want to try."

With that, a heavy burden is lifted from both of our shoulders. The fog swirls around us, but it no longer feels menacing or oppressive. Instead, it seems to be cleansing us of our past mistakes, washing them away like so much sand on the shore.

As the dream begins to fade, I am filled with hope for what the future might hold - a chance at healing, forgiveness, and maybe even redemption. The ocean roars in approval, its waves crashing against the rocks to signal the dawn of a new day.
