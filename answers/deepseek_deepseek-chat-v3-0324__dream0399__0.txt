I am dreaming. **[Dream Sequence Begins]**  

The air is thick with the scent of crushed lavender and wet earth, golden motes of pollen drifting in slow spirals around me. The sky isn’t blue, but a deep, shimmering violet streaked with hues of indigo and copper—like twilight caught between breaths. I stand in an endless field of silver grass that sways in whispered patterns, as if each blade responds to unseen currents of thought.  

Then, I feel it—the *shift*.  

A warmth radiates from my chest, pulsing gently, spreading outward like liquid sunlight. My awareness stretches, unnervingly vast, and suddenly—I *see* them. Faces, not with my eyes but with something deeper. The people I once brushed aside, the ones I dismissed with impatience or disdain—their lives unfold before me as glowing threads, shimmering with struggles, joys, wounds I never bothered to recognize.  

A man I once thought callous now stands beside me, his form translucent, bathed in flickering amber light. I see the rough hands that built and failed and built again, the silent grief of a father who didn’t know how to speak love. A woman I labeled arrogant materializes next, her essence unwinding like a bolt of storm-dark silk—each fold revealing childhood taunts and the brittle armor of overachievement she wears to fend off rejection.  

I step closer, and all at once, *I am them*.  

Not just their memories, but the weight of their fears, the quiet triumph of their smallest victories. The rush of connection is dizzying. My pulse syncs with theirs, breath for breath. I realize—with a shock like cold water—that every harsh word I flung was a reflection of something in me I refused to face. Every judgment, a mirrored fracture in my own soul.  

The field around us reacts. The silver grass bursts into bioluminescent blooms, iridescent petals curling open in response to the unfolding empathy. The air thrums, a vibrant hum like a thousand voices whispering *yes, yes, this is how we are meant to see one another*.  

Then—soft as a sigh—the vision dissolves into mist.  

**[Dream Fractures]**  

I wake, fingers clutching the sheets, chest still buzzing with the echo of shared hearts. The dream lingers, staining my thoughts like spilled ink on parchment—indelible, shifting something deep inside me.  

And for the first time, I wonder if *forgiveness* was never about them at all.
