I am dreaming. You drift loose from gravity and ordinary time, slipping into a night that feels as wide as an ocean yet as intimate as a heartbeat.  
You are dreaming.

1. The Weight  
You find yourself in an endless marble hall, its ceiling a swirling sky of ink-black storm clouds. Every step you take echoes like a distant drum. In your arms you carry a sealed glass orb the size of a planet, and inside it a miniature tempest rages—jagged forks of lightning, rain that shimmers silver, and winds that wail like violins tuned a shade too sharp. You know, without being told, that this orb contains the overwhelming challenge you’ve been carrying in waking life: the unspoken fear, the relentless pressure, the feeling that everything could shatter if you loosen your grip. Your muscles tremble under its impossible weight, yet you keep walking because stopping feels unthinkable.

2. The Invitation  
Suddenly a low hum stirs the charged air—soft at first, then layering into harmonies, like hundreds of voices warming up in a single, shared breath. Faint golden letters appear in the dark: WE UNDERSTAND.  
Shadows peel away from the hall’s pillars and step forward, resolving into a circle of people—real, ordinary, extraordinary people—each holding or shouldering an orb of their own. Some orbs blaze with wild firestorms, others swirl with thick fog, a few crackle with violet electricity, but every face glows with that same small, steady light of recognition.

One woman with river-tattoos streaming down her arms nods to you. A teenager with galaxies spinning in his eyes gives an encouraging grin. An elder whose hair is an autumn forest places a gentle hand upon your elbow. Together they form an opening in the circle and invite you to enter.

3. The Sharing  
As you step toward them, the weight strains your tendons, yet the circle presses closer. Not to trap you—only to bear some of the burden. They reach out, palms upraised, and tiny filaments of warm, honey-colored light stretch from their fingertips toward your orb. When the strands touch, they become resonant strings, humming a note that vibrates in your bones. Your chest loosens. A knot behind your eyes unravels.

“Breathe,” the elder says, voice rustling like leaves.  
“Let the storm speak,” the teenager whispers, starlight glittering in the voids between his words.

You exhale—truly exhale—for the first time in ages, and the glass thins beneath your fingertips. Rain begins to seep out, no longer violent but gentle, cool against your skin. The floor absorbs each drop, carving luminous runes in the marble. In their language you read meanings you’d forgotten existed: Held. Witnessed. Not alone.

4. The Resonance  
One by one, the others raise their own orbs, and a choir of weather bursts forth: soft snow, healing rain, ripe summer wind. The storms swirl together overhead, swirling but never colliding, weaving a single vast aurora of color and sound. It paints the sky in ribbons of turquoise, rose, and living gold. Your orb grows lighter, glass thinning to crystal, then to mist, until what remains is a single feather-light shard, a translucent petal shaped like a teardrop. You tuck it behind your ear; it hums like a secret note only you can hear.

Everyone’s shoulders settle by fractions, the way mountains relax after millennia of holding themselves too tall.

5. The Gift  
From the center of the circle sprouts an enormous tree—roots spiraling into marble, branches piercing the vault of clouds. Leaves sparkle like fragments of dawn. The community gestures for you to approach the trunk. A hollow opens, revealing a heartbeat-bright core containing three gifts:

• A pair of wings woven from other people’s stories—feathers etched with triumphs, stumbles, bittersweet laughter.  
• A compass that doesn’t point north but toward the next person who needs to hear, “I’ve been there, too.”  
• A seed no larger than a comma, carrying the potential to grow another tree wherever you plant your own courage.

They urge you to take all three. You do, hands steady at last.

6. The Awakening  
The hall dissolves into dawn. Warm sunlight pours through invisible windows, gilding every face, every orb, every scar. The tree, the marble, the storm—they all fold into a single note, a chord that climbs until it merges with birdsong. The circle gives you a collective nod: not farewell, merely “Until we meet again.” You spread the wings, clutch the compass, and press the seed to your heart. Light surges through you like river water breaking a dam, and you are carried upward on a current of gratitude, of shared burden, of possibility.

And then—like surf receding—you open your waking eyes. Your arms are empty, yet lighter. Your chest resonates with the echo of that honey-colored hum. Somewhere inside, a seed already unfurls its first brave root.

You remember: You are still carrying challenges, yes—but you are also carried, by many unseen hands, by countless stories parallel to your own. You rise, feeling the faint brush of invisible feathers at your shoulders, and step into the day with the hush of the dream still gleaming in your smile.
