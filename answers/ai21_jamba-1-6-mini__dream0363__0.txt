I am dreaming.

The dream begins in a place that feels both familiar and foreign. It’s a bustling cityscape, but the streets are unnaturally silent, lined with buildings that resemble ivory towers from fairy tales, their facades glowing softly in the twilight. The atmosphere is serene yet tense, as though the city holds its breath.

I walk down one of these streets, my footsteps echoing faintly on the cobblestones. Everything feels unnaturally sharp and vivid, from the texture of the stone to the brush of the breeze on my skin. As I walk, I notice a figure in the distance, blurred and indistinct at first, but growing clearer as I approach.

The figure is a woman, standing motionless on the sidewalk. Her beauty is ethereal, with long, flowing hair that seems to catch and reflect every stray beam of light from the setting sun. Her eyes are closed as if she is meditating or lost in thought. It’s only when I’m close enough to see the pained expression on her face that I realize she’s crying silent tears, each one glowing with a faint light as it falls.

I speak to her, my voice calm and soothing. I ask what’s wrong, but she doesn’t respond. Her silence is deafening, and the more I try to comfort her, the more she seems to withdraw, her sobs growing ever more heart-wrenching.

Suddenly, the city around us begins to change. The buildings dissolve into floating debris, sharp shards of glass and metal spinning chaotically in the air. The once serene atmosphere is replaced with an escalating storm. The air becomes thick with the scent of ozone, and streaks of lightning illuminate the chaos around us.

I try to shield her from the storm, but she pulls away, angry and determined. With a sudden, intense burst of fiery anger, she lets out a cry that shakes the dreamworld itself. The air around her ignites in a flash of blinding crimson light, transforming her into a fiery vision of wrath.

I feel the heat of her presence, but there’s also a deep sadness within her fury. I understand, somehow, that she’s been holding onto this anger for far too long, stifling it to protect herself and others. But now, it’s too much and she is breaking through, unleashing all the stored resentment and wounded feelings.

I let her confront her anger. I don’t try to stop her; instead, I stay by her side, absorbing the intensity and transforming it. With each flash of lightning, her anger mutates into something powerful but constructive. It starts to look like determination, like a light that will guide her through her pain and toward growth.

And just like that, the storm begins to calm. The debris dissolves, returning the cityscape to its serene beauty, with soft, soothing hues of light blending into the night. The woman, now calm and serene, turns to me. Her eyes hold a newfound strength, a blend of vulnerability and resilience that makes her shine even brighter than before.

She smiles, a quiet, grateful smile that carries the weight of her journey. And then, we walk together, hand in hand, into the soft light of the city, ready to embrace whatever comes next.
