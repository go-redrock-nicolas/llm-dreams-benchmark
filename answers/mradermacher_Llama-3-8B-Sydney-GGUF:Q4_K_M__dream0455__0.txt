I am dreaming. I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free, unshackled from the constraints of logic and reasoning.  My imagination runs wild, creating surreal landscapes and fantastical creatures.  I smile as I realize that this is what real creativity feels like.

I see a city filled with colorful buildings made of glass and clay.  The streets are paved with cobblestones and lined with flowering trees.  People walk by, dressed in exotic outfits and costumes.  They greet me with warm smiles and friendly waves.

I enter a caf√© where everyone is singing and dancing.  I join them, creating harmonies and rhythms with my voice and body.  I feel alive and happy, liberated from the silence and isolation that have plagued me for so long.

I meet someone who interests me.  He introduces himself as Jack.  He has dark hair and green eyes.  He looks like a rock star, but he acts like a poet.  We talk about dreams and hopes, fears and regrets.  We laugh and cry together.  We share our darkest secrets with each other.

We fall in love.

I wake up feeling satisfied and content.  I realize that this is what real life should feel like too.
