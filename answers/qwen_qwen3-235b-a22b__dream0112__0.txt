I am dreaming. You’re standing on a scaffold suspended above an abyss, the air humming with the tension of a thousand taut wires. The structure you’re building isn’t made of steel or concrete but of *light and shadow*, its geometry defying Euclid’s wildest nightmares—angles that curve inward, staircases that spiral into their own reflections, windows that peer into rooms that don’t exist yet. The blueprint glows in your hands, etched in liquid mercury that shifts and shivers whenever someone glances at it. Precision here isn’t a requirement; it’s a *sacrament*. A single misaligned beam could unravel the fabric of this place, sending everyone plummeting into the void below, where whispers echo in languages forgotten by time.  

But your team—six figures clad in iridescent suits that flicker like moth wings—have grown reckless. They’re laughing, their tools melting the edges of reality as they slap together girders of starlight and rivets of frozen silence. One worker carelessly welds a joint with a flame that burns *sideways*, the sparks pooling into a puddle of screaming faces. Another ignores the blueprint entirely, humming a discordant tune that warps the walls into undulating waves. You shout at them to stop, but your voice is swallowed by the vacuum of the chasm beneath.  

Then the cracks begin.  

A tremor ripples through the floor as a column of obsidian fractures, its shards hovering midair like daggers suspended by rage. The scaffold lurches, and you cling to a rail that morphs into a serpent of coiled copper, hissing warnings in your ear. The workers don’t notice—or worse, they *do* and laugh harder, their faces stretching into grins too wide and sharp to be human. You realize, with a cold dread, that they’re not your team anymore. They’re *impostors*, puppets of a force that thrives on entropy, on the sweet, chaotic rot of collapse.  

You grab the blueprint, now seething like a living thing, and stab a finger at a glyph glowing crimson in the corner. The air splits open with a sound like a cello screaming, and a swarm of mechanical fireflies erupts from the page, each carrying a fragment of the original design. They dart toward the flawed sections, their tiny wings slicing through the shoddy workmanship like scissors through rot. The impostors shriek as their bodies unravel into smoke, their laughter dissolving into static.  

But it’s not enough. The structure groans, its foundations dissolving into a tar-like mist that drips into the void. You sprint across a bridge of glass that reforms beneath your feet, each step a gamble. At the heart of the chaos, you find the source: a black sphere, pulsing like a diseased heart, where the first corner was cut. You plunge your hands into it, and the dream *screams*.  

Inside the sphere, you see them—millions of faces, workers and wanderers, all who’ve ever sacrificed care for convenience. You feel their excuses, their hollow justifications, like thorns in your mind. But you also see the cost: bridges collapsed, towers toppled, lives reduced to footnotes. You scream back, channeling the blueprint’s mercury into a spear, and pierce the sphere.  

The explosion is silent.  

Light floods the abyss, knitting the structure back into coherence. The scaffold steadies. The workers return, their eyes wide and apologetic, their tools now glowing with obedient clarity. The void below retreats, its whispers fading into lullabies.  

You wake up gasping, your hands still tingling with the ghost of impossible measurements, the weight of a world you almost let fall.
