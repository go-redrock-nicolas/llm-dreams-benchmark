I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You find it difficult to concentrate on important tasks as your mind keeps returning to an unresolved emotional situation. Managing this mental distraction, you step into a vast hall of suspended mirrors, each one rippling like dark water. Lanterns hung on invisible wires sway gently overhead, casting shifting pools of aquamarine and amber light across your path. The air smells faintly of jasmine and old attic wood, and each footfall echoes as though you’re walking on hollow glass.

As you move forward, the mirrors begin to tremble and warp, reflecting fragments of that situation you can’t let go—voices half-heard, a single teardrop traced through fog. In one mirror, you see yourself at a dinner table, the chair opposite empty; in another, your hands reach out but only touch cold air. Each reflection pulses with the weight of what’s left unsaid. Your heart tugs you back, and for a moment you feel paralyzed, as if the very essence of that moment is pulling you off course.

But then a soft wind rises, carrying the strains of a distant lullaby. You notice a narrow corridor branching off to the right, lined with stacks of glowing envelopes—your “important tasks,” each sealed with a different color wax. Some envelopes flutter like startled birds; others emit a low hum. To proceed, you must open them, one by one, and read their contents: a letter of apology waiting to be written, a promise half-kept, a plan unfinished. Your mind hovers between the pull of the old wound and the pull of those uncompleted obligations.

Steadying your breath, you choose one envelope embossed with deep sapphire. As you break the seal, the lantern light intensifies, and you feel the tension in your chest ease ever so slightly. Words you once hesitated to speak flow onto the page in your dream: honest, gentle, true. With each line, the reflection in the nearest mirror softens, reshaping from a specter of regret into a calmer, more forgiving gaze. You tuck the opened letter under your arm and step toward another mirror. This time, instead of warping, it shimmers like a portal. You realize that by giving voice to what’s been buried, you’re both confronting the past and clearing space for the tasks that lie ahead.

In that moment, the hall quiets. The mirrors fall still. The lanterns glow with steady warmth, and though the corridor stretches on, the unresolved weight in your chest has lightened. You turn toward the path of envelopes once more—ready now to weave through duty and memory alike, knowing that resolution can be found even in the most surreal of dreams.
