I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

You stand on a broad terrace carved from pale moonstone, its edges dissolving into mist. Beside you, your closest friend’s face is etched with hurt and defiance. All around, the sky pulses in slow heartbeats—first jade, then indigo, then a pale fireburst—mirroring the tension crackling between you. At the center of the terrace, a fountain made of glass shards sprays water that shimmers with impossible colors, each droplet reflecting a hundred versions of you and your friend locked in this very quarrel.  

Your voices rise and echo off a ring of violet trees whose leaves whisper your words back to you in soft, taunting laughter. “You promised,” your friend hisses, eyes blazing like twin suns. You answer with equal fervor, “I never meant to betray you!” In that moment, the terrace tilts—slowly, deliberately—until the fountain’s multi-hued spray settles into a calm sea beneath your feet. The trees bend inward, their branches weaving into a cage of living wood that hums with your anger.  

Heart pounding, you breathe in the sweet, electric air and you decide to shatter the boundary between you. You raise your hand and, with surprising strength, punch through one of the glass-shard walls of the fountain. The shards melt like candlewax at your touch, opening a rippling portal beneath the water. Tendrils of starlight snake upward through the fountain’s column, wrapping themselves around your wrist as if inviting you to step through.  

Your friend lunges, screams caught in their throat. For a breathless instant, you both hover between two worlds—the fractal forest behind you and an endless corridor of glowing lanterns before you, each lantern inscribed with a past promise, a future dream. You straighten your shoulders, heart heavy but resolute, and lead your friend by the hand into that corridor. The violet leaves exhale, releasing sparks of golden pollen that drift upward like fireflies.  

As you cross the threshold, the argument loses its weight. The lanterns flood the scene with gentle warmth, each beam weaving your friend’s hurt and your regret into threads of understanding. You look into your friend’s eyes—now soft pools of amethyst light—and both of you realize that this strange journey was never about winning. It was about learning to step together into new truths.  

And then you awaken, heart still echoing with that strange, luminous beat: promise, betrayal, forgiveness—woven forever into your own dreaming mind.
