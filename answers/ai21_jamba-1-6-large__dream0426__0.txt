I am dreaming. You open your eyes in the dream, standing on the edge of a vast, endless purple ocean under a sky filled with swirling pastel clouds. The wind whispers secrets you almost understand, carrying the faint scent of blooming jasmine. You realize you are barefoot, standing on warm, soft sand that glimmers faintly as if dusted with stardust.

A voice, soft yet commanding, calls your name. Turning, you see a figure cloaked in silvery light walking toward you. As they come closer, you recognize them as a version of yourself—older, wiser, and radiating calm.

"You've come to understand something important," they say. "You've been giving so much, yet the scales never seem balanced, do they?"

You nod, feeling a weight lift from your chest. The older version of you smiles gently. "It's time to reclaim what you've been giving away. Come with me."

Together, you walk along the shoreline. The water parts as you move, revealing paths of glittering coral beneath the surface. The waves pulse in rhythm to a distant heartbeat, growing louder with each step. As you walk, you notice fragments of yourself—broken pieces of glass, each reflecting a moment where you sacrificed your peace, your voice, your truth.

"Pick them up," the older you says. "They are yours, and you must carry them with care, not abandon them."

You kneel, collecting the pieces. As you do, they transform in your hands, becoming smooth and warm like polished stones. With each one, you feel a little lighter, a little stronger.

The path leads to a towering crystal tree at the ocean's edge. Its leaves glisten with dew that shimmers like tears. "This is where you remember yourself," the older you says, their voice gentle but firm. "Plant these fragments of yourself here. Let them grow into who you were always meant to be."

You place the fragments at the base of the tree. As you do, roots sprout, weaving themselves around the pieces, pulling them deep into the earth. The tree begins to glow, its branches stretching higher and higher, blooming with blossoms of golden light.

A wave of warmth washes over you. You feel whole, rooted yet free, strong yet flexible. The older version of you places their hands on your shoulders. "You will always be called to give—it is part of who you are. But remember this: you cannot pour from an empty cup. Fill your own well first."

You look at the tree, its branches now reaching the sky, and you know. You know that every sacrifice must be balanced by renewal, every act of giving by an act of receiving.

The dream begins to fade, the ocean, the tree, and your older self dissolving into mist. But as you wake, you carry with you the warmth of that golden light, the strength of the roots beneath your feet, and the certain knowledge that you are enough, just as you are.
