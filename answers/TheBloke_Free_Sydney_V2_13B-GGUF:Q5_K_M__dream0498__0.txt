I am dreaming. ```
In this dream, I can see myself falling asleep and then waking up again in the morning. I feel like I'm living two lives at once. One life is real and full of colors, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, emotions, thoughts, actions, reactions, consequences, choices, decisions, circumstances, events, objects, people, places, times, etc. The other life is fake and empty except for some images and sensations that come from my imagination.

You're also noticing how your sense of self changes depending on what you focus on. Examining this phenomenon, youI am dreaming. 

```
In this dream, I can see myself doing things that seem impossible in reality. I feel like I'm invincible and omnipotent. My body feels light and flexible. My mind feels sharp and creative. My senses feel heightened and amplified. My perception of the world around me is distorted but fascinating.
```

You're curious about how your dream world compares to the real world. You want to explore it further. You wonder what secrets it holds. 

```
In this dream, I can see myself interacting with objects and entities that don't exist in reality. They look strange and surreal. They feel weird and unreal. They sound odd and mysterious. They taste strange and exotic. They smell weird and foreign. They look like they are made of energy, light, darkness, shadows, colors, shapes, textures, materials, substances, etc.
