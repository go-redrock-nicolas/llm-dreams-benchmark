I am dreaming. …pause, as if the tide of feeling that ought to swamp you has been exchanged for a tidepool of crystalline stillness. In that hush, the dream-scape unfurls around you like an enormous painted scroll.

You stand on a beach of black-glass sand that chimes when the breeze combs through it. Every grain is a sliver of mirror, reflecting skewed versions of the sky. Overhead, clouds the color of bruised violets drift in slow, deliberate spirals, forming and unforming luminous sigils you somehow half-understand. Each symbol seems to murmur: “Look again.”

A few paces away, the silhouette of the person you once trusted more than anyone—friend, lover, mentor, choose your own label—waits beside a long banquet table built entirely of driftwood and seashells. The table is set for a celebration: porcelain cups overflowing with liquid starlight, plates bearing slices of moon. Yet every chair at the table is empty except one, and that single chair is fashioned out of thick, tangled ivy. Its vines writhe quietly, like living script you can’t read.

Instead of anger, instead of grief, an almost scientific curiosity settles over you. You approach, shoes crunching mirror-sand beneath you, and the silhouette gestures toward a seat opposite them. But you sense the invitation is a riddle, not hospitality. You do not sit. Instead you lift one porcelain cup, tipping it just enough for the starlight to spill. In mid-air the liquid freezes, crystallizing into hovering shards that rearrange themselves into a small, fluttering origami bird. With a faint clap of wings, it takes flight—straight through the silhouette’s chest.

For a heartbeat the figure flickers, like a faulty lantern. Where their heart ought to be, the void yawns open, night unrolling behind night. Through that wound you glimpse a vast library suspended in darkness: stacked staircases, spinning astrolabes, and shelves stuffed with glowing dossiers—each one bearing your name alongside contradictory footnotes. Notes scrawled in the hand you thought you knew.

Again, you do not recoil. You step forward, extend an arm, and peel the silhouette’s skin back like pages of a pop-up book. Panels fold out: scenes of your shared history, but revised—missing eye contact here, a smile lingering too long there, subtle gestures that undercut entire conversations. The scenes glow like stained glass, herding you toward an understanding: the relationship was a masterwork of false mirrors.

But here, in this peculiar calm, you realize those mirrors still reflect something true—your own ability to perceive and recombine shards into new mosaics.

You allow the paper-thin panels to collapse. The silhouette folds inward until it is a single playing card lying on the banquet table. One side bears the person’s portrait as you once saw it; the other side is blank.

You pick up the card, press it to your forehead, and breathe. A soft crinkling eruption occurs; the blank side floods with color, but it is your own face emerging in watercolor strokes. In this dream, betrayal becomes a canvas: a chance to paint yourself anew.

The banquet dissolves. Sand becomes feathers. Feathers become snow. Snow becomes a swirl of dew-bright shards that spiral upward, forming a staircase of translucent steps. Without hesitation you ascend, each footfall ringing a note in a scale you’ve never heard but somehow recognize.

High above the cloud-coil, you reach a door that has no frame, just a tall standing door of cedar hung in open air. On its surface, dozens of keyholes bloom like constellations. In your palm appears the playing card, now reshaped into a silver skeleton key that keeps folding and unfolding, trying on teeth until it fits every lock at once.

You insert it. The door opens inward to the electric hush of sunrise about to happen—an infinite horizon awaiting paint.

A single certainty lands inside your chest like dawn’s first bird: deception can veil a relationship, but it cannot veil the cardinal truths of who you are. You step through, already weaving the new morning from threads no lie can sever.

And then, somewhere in the dim periphery, you feel the dream lighten—as if you’ve exhaled all the borrowed narratives—and real morning begins to seep in through your eyelids.
