I am dreaming. I find myself ascending an endless spiral staircase carved into the core of what seems to be a massive sequoia tree. The wood beneath my feet is warm, almost alive, and pulses with a gentle amber glow with each step I take. As I climb, I notice my shoulders are weighed down by an ornate silver backpack that grows inexplicably heavier with each turn of the staircase.

Curious, I stop and open it. Inside are countless crystal orbs, each containing miniature perfect versions of myself accomplishing impossible feats: conducting symphonies while solving mathematical equations; scaling mountains while simultaneously painting their vistas; healing the sick while writing profound poetry. Each orb shimmers with expectation, demanding to be fulfilled.

The weight is crushing me. My knees buckle. The spiral stairs begin to narrow impossibly.

Suddenly, a blue monarch butterfly lands on my hand. Its wings unfold into a mirror, reflecting not my strained face but my eyes—filled with a compassion I've never allowed myself. A voice like rustling leaves whispers, "These are not your burdens to bear all at once."

With trembling fingers, I begin to remove the orbs. Some I release into the air where they float like bubbles, not disappearing but drifting alongside me, possibilities rather than obligations. Others I carefully place on small wooden shelves that materialize from the staircase walls, waiting for their proper time.

As the weight lifts, the staircase widens into a sun-dappled clearing. The tree has opened to reveal a circle of other trees, each bearing a single fruit of different colors. I understand without words that perfection was never the goal—growth was.

I wake with tears on my cheeks, breathing deeply for what feels like the first time in years.
