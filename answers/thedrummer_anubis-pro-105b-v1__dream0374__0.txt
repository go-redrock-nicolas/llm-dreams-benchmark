I am dreaming. swirling tides of subconsciousness carry me on a journey inside my own mind. Vivid landscapes of ocular imagination play across the mental canvas, blending with the coloured paints of recollection to create a perfect portrait of dreamscape creativity.

Watching from a distant corner, I see another individual lavished with praise and accolades. My head pounds with the chorus of pulsing anger, as the semblance of pride and recognition are bestowed upon them for something you yourself contributed so heavily to.

Steamy waves of restless discomfort course through every fiber of your being. Wrenching slivers of the rawest pain and guttural heartache bleed out with each heavy breath. How could they receive this praise and adoration for the work YOU toiled diligently over? Each twist of the knife cuts deeper - with the blunt, crushing butchery of thievery and unrelenting disrespect.

A thunderstorm of jarring emotions crashes - errupting with the jagged shards of brutal betrayal and scathing heartache. Time slows to a choatic crawl and seems to stretch for an eternity. Agony paints its world across every animated cell, reeling from the weight of unparalleled injustice. A scream of unabashed fury swells inside and threatens to burst free every second. It's a battle to keep this tidal wave of passionate pain from crashing down or erupting. The respect, understanding and acknowledgement... lost to a lie. 
And here you are, receiving none of it.
