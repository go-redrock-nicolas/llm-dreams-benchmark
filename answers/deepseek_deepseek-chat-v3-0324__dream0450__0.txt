I am dreaming. The stale fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting sterile white squares across the endless maze of identical cubicles. The air smells of bitter coffee and toner ink, thick with the sour tang of resignation. My fingers hover over the keyboard as Excel spreadsheets blur before my eyes - endless rows of numbers meant to quantify human lives into profit margins and quarterly growth. My throat constricts.  

But then...the walls begin to breathe.  

The gray fabric cubicle partitions ripple like living flesh, inhaling and exhaling in slow, organic waves. Where corporate motivational posters once hung, intricate fungal colonies now bloom - pulsating veins of bioluminescent moss spelling out warnings in some ancient, subterranean language. The carpet between my feet erupts with bright crimson toadstools, their caps splitting open to release clouds of golden spores that taste of burning sugar on my tongue.  

From the emergency exit door creaking open down the hall, I hear them coming. Not footsteps, but something wetter - the squelching slide of something uncoiling against linoleum. My reflection in the dark monitor screen shows eyes that aren't mine anymore; irises swirling with nebulae, teeth elongating into obsidian shards. The work badge around my neck grows thorns that pierce my sternum as the nameplate corrodes, revealing my true title in searing glyphs:  

**KEEPER OF BROKEN PROMISES**  

(Don't wake up. Stay here in the beautiful rot. Let the numbers bleed into poetry and the quarterly reports blossom into prophecy. The spreadsheet cells are splitting - can't you hear them screaming?)  

My hands plunge into the keyboard like soft earth, sprouting vines that crack through the ceiling as the building's steel bones groan into wild, verdant rebellion.
