I am dreaming. You wake not in your bed, but on the edge of a cliff that spirals like a seashell, its layers carved from obsidian and moonstone. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, shifting and hissing, while below, a river of liquid starlight carves through a valley of floating islands. Your pulse thrums in your throat as a voice—not spoken, but *felt*—ripples through the air: *“The Labyrinth of the Unbound Awaits. Enter, or forever wonder what you feared.”*  

Before you stands a gateway forged from the bones of extinct creatures—pterodactyl ribs arch into a keystone, mammoth tusks twist into serpentine pillars. At its center, a figure materializes: part human, part storm. Their skin crackles with lightning, eyes twin black holes that devour light. They offer you a vial of molten gold, its surface swirling with whispers. *“Drink,”* they intone, *“and your body becomes the terrain. Your blood, the map. But the Labyrinth devours those who falter.”*  

You sip.  

Fire floods your veins. Your bones hollow into bamboo reeds; your skin hardens into scales that shimmer like oil on water. The world *shifts*. The cliff becomes a living maze—walls of thorned ivy scream as you brush them, floors of gelatinous quartz swallow your footsteps before spitting you forward. Shadows here have weight, pressing against you like wet velvet. You run, not forward but *upward*, scaling walls that tilt into vertical oceans, where gravity forgets you unless you believe.  

Then comes the Trial of Mirrors.  

A chamber lined with glass that reflects not your face, but versions of yourself: a warrior drowning in armor, a poet with their tongue cut out, a child buried up to their neck in sand. Each mirror pulses with a question: *“What did you bury to survive? What lie keeps you whole?”* The walls close in, shards slicing the air. You smash one—your hand erupts in butterflies—and the room laughs, a sound like collapsing cathedrals.  

Beyond lies the Heart: a pulsing orb of anti-light, cold and hungry. To claim the Labyrinth’s “prize,” you must plunge your transformed body into its core. The storm-being reappears, their voice a tectonic rumble: *“You will feel every death you’ve ever imagined. Yours. Theirs. The extinction of stars. But also… the birth.”*  

You leap.  

The cold is a symphony. You fracture into a thousand shards of memory: a drowning, a fall, a goodbye never spoken. Yet in the void, you glimpse *creation*—galaxies knitting themselves from threads of your breath, planets blooming like bruises on the skin of nothingness. You are both annihilated and *reborn*, a paradox cradled in the palm of the dark.  

When you wake, your sheets are soaked in phantom sweat, and the taste of molten gold lingers on your tongue. For a heartbeat, your reflection in the window flickers—a stranger with lightning in their veins, smiling faintly, as if remembering.
