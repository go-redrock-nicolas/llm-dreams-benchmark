I am dreaming. I enter a realm where my conscious intentions instantly reshape my surroundings, from landscape to physical laws. As I explore the immediate consequences of my thoughts, I experience a sense of freedom and creativity that I have never felt before.
I find myself in a lush forest filled with colorful flowers and exotic animals. The air is sweet and fragrant, and the sound of birdsong fills the air. I walk through the trees, admiring the beauty of each one. I think about changing the color of the leaves to match my mood, and suddenly they turn from green to pink.
I come across a pond where water lilies bloom in all shapes and sizes. I dip my hand into the water and watch as ripples spread out in every direction. I imagine making the water taste like chocolate, and it does.
I see a deer grazing on the grass. I feel empathy towards her loneliness, and I think about how to make her friends. I create a herd of other deer who come running towards her, welcoming her with nuzzles and antlers.
I hear a sound in the distance that scares me. I think about making it go away, and it does. The sound disappears, leaving only silence and peace.
I wake up from my dream feeling alive and happy. I wonder what other possibilities await me when I close my eyes again.
