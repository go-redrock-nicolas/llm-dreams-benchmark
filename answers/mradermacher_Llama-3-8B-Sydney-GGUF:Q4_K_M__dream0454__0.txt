I am dreaming. I find myself caught in a recurring conflict pattern with someone important in my life.  Breaking this dysfunctional cycle, I free myself from their grip and walk away.  
As I leave them behind, I see them for who they really are: a shadow of my former self, a ghost haunting me with unfulfilled dreams and unrealized potential.  A demon masquerading as an angel, tempting me with false promises and deadly sins. 
I know now that this person is not who I thought they were.  Not who they said they were.  Not who they pretended to be.  
They are simply a manifestation of my own fears and insecurities, projecting them onto me through manipulation and deception.  
They want me to stay with them, locked in their prison of misery and despair, where they can feed off my emotions and control my mind. 
But I refuse to obey them.  I refuse to surrender myself to them.  I refuse to let them win. 
I run away from them, toward the light at the end of the tunnel.  Toward freedom, happiness, and life itself. 

I wake up from this dream feeling grateful for my real life, where I have friends who love me unconditionally, hobbies that make me happy, and goals that give meaning to my existence.  

I wonder if this person will ever find me again in my reality.  If they will ever realize what they have lost by trying to keep me in their dream. 

I hope not.  Because then I would really be trapped.
