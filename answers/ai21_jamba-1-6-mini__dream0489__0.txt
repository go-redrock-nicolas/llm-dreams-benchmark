I am dreaming.

In this dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, mist-covered forest. The trees are old and gnarled, their branches reaching out like ancient, skeletal arms. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the light filtering through the canopy is a dim, haunting blue.

As I step into the woods, the silence is so profound that it feels like the forest could swallow me whole. The only sounds are the gentle rustle of leaves and the occasional distant call of a bird. The mist wraps around me, obscuring everything beyond a few feet. I feel small and insignificant, like a toy figure in a child's elaborate setup.

Despite the eeriness, there is a sense of calm. The forest seems to have its own rhythm, a slow, deliberate beat that beats the air with every breath. I move forward, my footsteps muffled by the thick carpet of leaves and moss.

Soon, I come upon a small, overgrown path. It is barely visible, but as I follow it, it widens, and the fog begins to lift. The trees thin out, and the light grows brighter. The forest gives way to a clearing, and in the center of the clearing stands a strange, ancient building.

It is a temple, but not like any temple I have seen before. The architecture is intricate and ornate, with towering spires and delicate carvings. The structure is made of gray stone, yet it glows faintly, as if lit from within. Ivy and wildflowers twine around the walls, concealing much of the stonework.

Intrigued, I approach the temple. The door is massive, made of solid oak and carved with runes and symbols I cannot understand. There is a strange energy emanating from the door, a pulsing, vibrating energy that seems to call to me.

Without hesitation, I push the door open. The inside is even grander than the outside. The ceiling is high and vaulted, with intricate frescoes and mosaics depicting scenes of myth and legend. The air inside is warm and humid, and the faint smell of incense lingers in the air.

At the center of the temple is a large, circular pool. The water is crystal clear and reflects the light from the ceiling, creating an almost hypnotic pattern on the walls. Surrounding the pool are statues of mythical creatures and unknown deities, each holding a different object or performing a different action. The statues are so lifelike that they almost seem to breathe.

As I walk around the pool, I feel a strange energy buzzing through me. I glance around, and the statues seem to shift and move slightly, almost as though they are alive. I hear a faint, whispering voice in my mind, urging me to look closer.

With each step I take, the buzzing in my head grows stronger and the energy in the room becomes more intense. I reach out to touch one of the statues, and it feels warm, almost alive, as if it were ready to spring to life. A sense of déjà vu overwhelms me, as though I have been here before, as though I know .
