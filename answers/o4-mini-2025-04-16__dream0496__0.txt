I am dreaming. You step through a veil of mist and immediately your senses stretch wider than waking ever allowed. The air trembles with colors you’ve never named—liquid crimsons that pulse against velvet-green leaves, cobalt ripples dancing along every branch. As you wander, a shimmering pool appears at your feet. Its surface swirls with galaxies, each star a tiny heartbeat. Instead of recoiling at the uncanny, you bend closer, curiosity blossoming like opal petals beneath your chest.  

A gentle hum beckons you onward. You follow a path of phosphorescent stones that pulse underfoot, lighting your way through a forest where trees, tall as cathedrals, shift their shapes when you blink: sometimes slender spires, sometimes broad-bellied guardians. With each step, you notice how your thoughts soften—where judgment once bristled, wonder now blooms.  

Suddenly, the forest gives way to a floating archipelago of islands drifting on currents of lavender wind. You leap from one to another without fear; gravity seems negotiable here. On the nearest isle, a congregation of creatures gathers: they have transparent skin crisscrossed by veins of living starlight. Their faces are neither human nor beast but exquisitely in-between. Instead of recoiling, you greet them with a slow nod, heart open. They respond in a chorus of tones—some low and resonant, others tinkling like icicles. Each tone paints a distinct emotion across the sky: gentle golds for joy, soft turquoise for surprise, deep indigo for contemplation.  

A creature drifts closer, offering you a crystalline seed the size of your palm. In the past you might have judged it dangerous or strange; now, your hand lifts to receive it, open and unguarded. The instant it touches your skin, you feel memories unravel from your body like silk threads—childhood laughter trapped in dusk-lit fields, first awakenings of wonder at a butterfly’s wing. You hold them carefully, not to hoard or judge, but to study their delicate pattern.  

Clutching the seed, you sense it bloom inside your chest. Suddenly the dreamscape shifts: the islands reform into concentric rings around a soaring spire of glass and light. You ascend a staircase of stardust to reach a mirrored chamber at its summit. In the reflection stands not only you but countless variants: a you who never learned fear, a you who always questioned, a you who believed in magic without hesitation. Rather than disdain or confusion, you regard each with gentle curiosity. “Tell me your story,” you whisper, and each reflection replies in a chorus of memories and possibilities.  

As you listen, the mirrored versions dissolve into motes of light that swirl back into your heart. You feel your own self expand—more flexible, more vast—holding room for all your past judgments and your new openness alike. The dreamscape brightens until the glass spire dissolves into prisms of dawn.  

You wake on soft grass with dew sparkling at your fingertips. The residue of that boundless curiosity lingers—an ember in your chest. In the half-light of morning, you realize that approaching life with wonder has reshaped you: no longer a passive observer, you are the dreamer who shapes reality itself.
