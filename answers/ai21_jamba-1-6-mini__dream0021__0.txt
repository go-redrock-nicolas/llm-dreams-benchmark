I am dreaming. I am carefully chosen by my team to represent them in a titanic competition against opponents who are vastly experienced. My heart pounds with a mix of excitement and fear as all eyes, like a thousand spotlights, turn to me. The weight of every gaze presses on my shoulders, yet I cannot back down. I inhale deeply, and as I exhale, my doubts scatter like moths drawn to light. The world fades to a blur around me, and I am consumed by the task at hand. The competition is a crescendo of energy, the stakes as high as the cloudless sky, and I stand in the eye of the storm, ready for whatever comes. A grin tugs at my lips as I realize this is the moment I've been waiting for all along, and in a flash, everything changes. What happens next is my story to tell.
