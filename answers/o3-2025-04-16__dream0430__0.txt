I am dreaming. …I am dreaming.

The dream begins in a place no one thinks of as beautiful: a long-forgotten service tunnel beneath a commuter train station. Fluorescent bulbs buzz overhead, their light brittle and harsh—but tonight something in that ordinary glare refracts, scatters, and blooms. Each cracked tile along the walls has become a mosaic of shifting constellations, as though the Milky Way has draped itself across utilitarian subway porcelain. Dust motes float like golden plankton in slow water, catching flecks of turquoise, rose, and indigo that shouldn’t exist under such pallid lamps.  

People hurry above, oblivious, their footsteps a distant tide. I alone feel the hush, the way the chipped paint on steel beams hums with unsung lullabies. The rhythmic clatter of trains vibrates up through my bones until my ribs vibrate like tuning forks. A half-broken vending machine at the far end of the corridor suddenly exhales a breath scented of sea salt and vanilla bean. Its glass front clouds, then clears, revealing not candy bars but miniature seascapes—tiny waves crash against sugar-quartz shores, and seagulls carved of light flicker out of view whenever I lean too close.

Drawn onward, I press through an exit door no commuter ever notices: a rusted panel smeared with maintenance schedules. The moment it swings open, the tunnel dissolves into a meadow lit by lavender twilight. The sky feels impossibly near, the clouds hanging like soft lanterns within arm’s reach. Grass blades glimmer silver at their tips, and each step strikes a chord on some unseen harp. A lone tree stands ahead, gnarled but radiant, its bark etched with lines of poetry in languages I have never learned yet intuitively understand. Where knots should be, there are windows; through them I glimpse entire memories—first dances, half-forgotten lullabies, unvoiced apologies—glimmering like jewels inside the grain.

A hush settles, the kind of silence that quivers with impending revelation. When I place my palm to the trunk, the tree sighs; petals made of luminous ink rain down and swirl around my ankles. Each petal bears a single word: “remember,” “listen,” “behold,” “forgive.” I gather them in my pockets instinctively, though they weigh less than hopes and smell faintly of old paperbacks.

In the distance rise crumbling factory chimneys—monuments to industry, smoke stacks long cold. Their bricks are peppered with iridescent beetles whose wing-covers hold entire nebulae. Moss carpets the rusted catwalks in emerald velvet. I cross over a skeletal bridge, and every rivet sings a different note, transforming my footfalls into a wandering melody. Mid-bridge I look down: the river isn’t water but glass marbles rolling endlessly, each containing a miniature sunset. They tinkle softly, a fluid of light.

As I step onto the far bank, a wind stirs: it smells of ozone and library basements. Swirling around me, it carries scraps of sheet music. The pages rearrange themselves midair, rolling into a scroll that unspools across the sky. Suddenly I understand—the entire scene is an orchestra, silent until acknowledged. I lift my hands, uncertain, and with the simplest gesture everything bursts into sound: violins spun from spider silk, cellos hewn from hollowed thunderclouds, a flute carved from moonbone. Yet the volume never overwhelms; it feels like a private performance inside my heartbeat.

Behind the music lies another pulse—an invitation. I follow it through a gate made of fractured mirrors, each pane reflecting a truer version of my face than the last. On the final shard, my reflection smiles at me first, as though encouraging courage. I step through and find myself back in the service tunnel, yet now the ugly walls throb with living color. Commuters hurry past again, but their shoulders skim rainbow ripples they cannot see. A child tugs their mother’s sleeve, pointing in wonder, but the mother misses it; she’s scrolling through glowing notifications. The dream pauses, exhaling a lesson into my ears:

Wherever the world grows dull, beauty has merely camouflaged itself—waiting for a traveler patient enough to notice.

I wake with pockets still warm from impossible petals, their scent of old stories lingering in the morning air.
