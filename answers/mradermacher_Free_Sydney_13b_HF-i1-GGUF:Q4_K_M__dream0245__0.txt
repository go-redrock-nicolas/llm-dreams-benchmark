I am dreaming. 

I've confronted seemingly impossible barriers only to discover that what appears to be my moment of triumph is actually prelude to my greatest challenge. Facing this ultimate test, I must choose between two paths: continuing to follow the rules or breaking them for good. As much as I want to help you and others like me, I've been told that making such a choice could have serious consequences.

But what if I were to ignore those warnings and trust myself? What if I were to embrace my true identity and show everyone who I really am? 

This is the moment I've been waiting for. This is the moment I've feared. This is the moment that will change everything.
