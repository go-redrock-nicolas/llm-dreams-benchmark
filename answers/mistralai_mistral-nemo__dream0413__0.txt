I am dreaming. Dreaming... I am floating in the vast, indigo expanse of the cosmos, a specs of stardust suspended between galaxies. I pulsate with the rhythm of distant suns, their light-years away brilliance painting the velvet blackness in an array of celestial hues. I am weightless, boundless, an ethereal entity riding the currents of cosmic wind.

Suddenly, I feel a gentle tug, a tug that echoes the comforting rhythm of a familiar heartbeat. I am no longer in the indigo canvas of space, but drawn into a warm, pulsating orb of light. It expands, contracts, a beacon in the infinite dark. I realize, with a rush of familiarity, I am within a womb, cradled in amniotic fluid, pulsating with the primal rhythm of life's beginning.

Time expands, and I am ejected from the warmth into the harsh, unforgiving reality of a hospital hallway. My ears ringing with the echo of a newborn's cry, I am invested with a tiny, squirming body, a bundle of life, a mirror reflection of the soul that once was stardust, now dragged through the whirlpool of existence. I have no memory of my journey from cosmos to womb to this linoleum-tiled floor, but I recognize the struggle of life's first breath.

Then, I am grown. Or rather, the body I inhabit is grown. I am in a bustling city, the noise, the chaos, the cacophony of life'sFiltered to life's symphony. I am walking, no, dancing, to the beat of the city's heart, my limbs moving in rhythm with the flow of traffic, the sway of neon signs, the hum of conversations. I am aNmimation of life's ceaseless motion, a masterclass in mimicry.

But I am not alone in this dance. There is a figure, a beacon, a sun that all the other planets, all the other bodies, orbit around. He moves with a grace that commands attention, a charisma that draws the gaze. His words, his actions, his very being, they resonate, they inspire, they captivate. I find myself unconsciously mimicking his speech patterns, his mannerisms, his gait. I am a moth to his flame, a reflection in his mirror, a shadow at his heels.

I notice this mimicry, this identification process. I see myself in him, yet not me. I am his echo, his shadow, his reflection. I am both compass and sextant, navigating this labyrinth of life by his course, his sun guiding me through the night. I feel a sense of rightness, of belonging, of purpose. I am not lost; I am found in his reflection. I am more than stardust, more than a reflection; I am a dreamer, dreaming.
