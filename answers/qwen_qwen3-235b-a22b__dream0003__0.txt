I am dreaming. I float weightlessly through a vast expanse of midnight blue mist, stars blinking silently all around me, burning with slow, ancient fire. Time drips here, slower than honey, every heartbeat echoed by a deep, resonant chime that seems to come from everywhere at once. Below me, if such a thing as “below” could be said to exist in this dream, a landscape stirs — not quite solid, not quite formless — a shifting terrain of mirror-like lakes and floating islands crowned with skeletal trees.

Suddenly, the chime grows loud — a thunderous toll, not heard but felt in my bones. Before me, suspended in the veils of mist, appears a **box.** Mysterious. Impossibly carved. It hovers on unseen currents, rotating gently, as though showing itself off like a jewel in moonlight. It doesn’t gleam or sparkle, and yet it captivates me. It pulses with a quiet magic, as if the dream itself is breathing around it.

I drift closer — the box not moving, yet always just in front of me as though tethered to my heartbeat. The **patterns** on its surface dance in a secret language I almost understand. Bands of metallic inlays curl like the veins of ancient leaves, and tiny runes bloom and vanish like fireflies in endless succession. Spiral after spiral… eyes wink from the carvings, turning round and peering at me then blinking again into plain wood. It’s alive in a way that’s both wholly unnatural and utterly timeless.

There is no **key** — and I search. My fingers reach out and press slightly on the lid, on the corners, around the ornate latches. Nothing yields. The box resists, as though sealed with more than mechanisms. With oaths. With forgotten names. With dreams so ancient they’ve been erased from every mind but the box’s.

I close my eyes and whisper something — not aloud, but within. A word I’ve never spoken, never even **known**, yet one that returns to me like a forgotten melody perfectly remembered. The box trembles. The mist shifts. The stars above flare brilliantly for a heartbeat, then dim.

Suddenly, I see it — a single line, a hair-thin seam of **light**, tracing a shape on the surface of the box. Not a keyhole. Something stranger. A symbol: a spiral unfolding within a triangle wrapped in flame — not of fire, but of pure memory. My memory?

When I touch that line, the world **shudders** — not violently, but as though it remembered something it had tried to forget. The mist turns gold around me. The lakes below begin to sing in voices I cannot understand but feel to my soul.

A shape forms beside the box — or perhaps it had been there all along and only now appears. A mirror, made not of glass but of liquid shadow. My reflection stares back, but it is not me — it is someone else entirely. Dressed in royal blue robes, hair like woven moonlight, eyes burning with ancient knowing.

It mouths a word: **trust**.

The box begins to open — slowly, infinitely slowly — revealing not darkness, but a void of radiant stars. Not stars from the sky, but **dream-stars**, the kind that burn lives, stories, destinies. Each one flickers with a different tale. As they pour forth from the box, I feel them brush past me like whispers in the dark — voices from other worlds, stories that never happened, lives unlived, selves forgotten.

One touches me… and I see.

A me—I, but not *me*—standing in an ivy-choked cathedral of fog, weeping over the grave of a forgotten god.

Another dances through the air—this me is a wild-haired painter in a city that hums with music and blood, painting not with colors, but with breath and fear.

A final star settles on my palm—soft, warm, gentle—and I awaken one last time within the dream. I am sitting on the bank of a spectral river, holding hands with someone I’ve never met… yet know by name.

Then everything fade to blue again.

And I wake… only to realize the box is now gone.

But *I* am different.

Not older, not quite wiser.

Just... opened.
