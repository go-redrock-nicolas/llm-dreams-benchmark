I am dreaming. The air around me feels dense yet weightless, charged with a peculiar electric quality that makes the tiny hairs on my arms stand at attention. My heartbeat quickens before I understand why, a primal recognition of something extraordinary unfolding.

I find myself standing on the shore of a vast ocean that shouldn't exist. The water glows from within—not the reflected light of sun or moon, but a bioluminescent cobalt radiance pulsing like a heartbeat. Each wave that laps against my bare feet leaves behind crystalline particles that sink into my skin, sending tingling sensations racing up my legs.

The sky above isn't sky at all, but an undulating canvas of memories—some mine, some belonging to strangers—projected across celestial space. I watch fragments of childhood birthdays bleed into wedding ceremonies of people I've never met, their faces simultaneously unfamiliar and deeply known.

My body feels simultaneously heavier and lighter than it should, as if gravity has become selective. When I breathe in, the air tastes of cinnamon and thunderstorms, carrying whispers of conversations happening miles away or years ago.

A path materializes before me, constructed of floating stepping stones made of compressed light. Each stone shifts color according to my emotions—sapphire when curiosity flickers, amber when uncertainty creeps in.

As I step onto the path, I feel my consciousness expanding beyond my physical form. My fingers extend into branches of light, reaching toward distant horizons where mountains grow and collapse like breathing creatures. I can feel the weight of ancient wisdom settling in my chest, knowledge no waking mind could contain without fracturing.

Ahead, a doorway stands unsupported, its frame carved from impossibly intricate patterns that rearrange themselves when I try to focus on them. Beyond the threshold lies whatever I most need to discover—a truth my waking self has been artfully avoiding.

I move toward it, my heart thrumming with recognition of something profound waiting to be remembered.
