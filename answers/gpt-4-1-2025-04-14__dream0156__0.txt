I am dreaming. ...suddenly find yourself adrift in a vast and shifting landscape—a surreal realm crafted from the fragments of endless feeds and flickering screens. All around you, shimmering towers built from stacked emojis reach dizzying heights, their walls pulsating with the glow of unread notifications. The air is thick with the static crackle of perpetual updates, as hashtags flutter past like electric butterflies, their wings leaving trails of pixelated light.

You walk forward, your footsteps echoing on a glowing glass avenue lined by billboards that endlessly scroll with friend requests, news alerts, and envy-inducing highlight reels. Each display whispers for your attention, vying to pull you further into the digital current. The sky overhead glitches and warps, shifting from sunrise to midnight in a heartbeat, as if time itself has lost meaning here.

As you wander, your phone—impossibly heavy in your hand—begins to vibrate more insistently. You glance at the glowing screen, and a graph bursts forth like a phosphorescent phantom, its bars climbing relentlessly higher: your daily screen times scrawled in sharp, accusing numbers. Anxiety weaves through your dream like a silvery thread, binding your thoughts tighter and tighter.

Suddenly, a gentle breeze rushes through the avenue, dissolving the billboards and pixel towers into a swirling mist of gentle blue and green. You look up to see sturdy trees made of living circuitry, their branches spreading wide and sheltering small creatures with faces made from your closest friends’ profiles. The creatures giggle and beckon you to sit beneath the glowing digital canopy.

In this oasis, the frantic noise settles to a soft murmur. Warm light pools around you, soothing away the static jitters. You close your eyes and breathe deeply, finding strange comfort in the harmonious blend of nature and technology. Here, you remember the texture of offline living: the way sunlight feels, the sound of your real heartbeat—steady and sure.

You awaken within the dream, recognizing the power to shape your digital landscape as surely as you shape your waking world. Social media fades to a gentle background glow. The forest beckons you onward, inviting you to balance and awareness.

In this vivid world swirling between reality and illusion, you promise yourself to return—if only to remember what it means to be truly present, both on- and offline.
