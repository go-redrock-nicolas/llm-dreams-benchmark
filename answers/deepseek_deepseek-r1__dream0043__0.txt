I am dreaming. 
I am dreaming.

I stand at the nexus of a living labyrinth, its walls woven from pulsating constellations. Numbers spiral across the archways like schools of bioluminescent fish—prime sequences darting violet, fractal branches crackling gold. The air hums Vincent van Gogh’s *Starry Night* reimagined as algebraic opera.

My bare feet press against mosaic tiles that shift like piano keys underfoot. Each step plays a chord of calculus—derivatives murmuring minor thirds, integrals resonating in perfect fourths. To my left floats a swarm of Klein bottles containing miniature supernovae, their colors shifting hex codes every  seconds. 

A hydra of equations unfurls before me: six heads reciting Taylor series backward in Ancient Greek while their tails sketch non-Euclidean proofs in galactic dust. I spin Riemann zeta functions into lassos, catching fractal stags that sprint across hyperbolic planes. Their antlers drip Mandelbrot honey, golden and infinite.

The sky fractures into a Voronoi diagram. Each cell pulses with the heartbeat of a different mathematician—hypnotic Gauss-thunder here, Ramanujan monsoon rhythms there. My mind becomes a Moebius strip taut with tension: I balance Feynman diagrams on my tongue while rehearsing Cantor's diagonal argument in reverse.

Wind whispers through Hilbert's Hotel—all rooms occupied, yet always space for more. My reflection splinters across quantum mirrors, each shard calculating entropy in base 12. Suddenly, Euler's identity blooms beneath my ribs, sprouting roots that crack the labyrinth's floor. I fall through Pythagoras' nightmare—an endless descent where irrational numbers sing lullabies in perfect harmony.
