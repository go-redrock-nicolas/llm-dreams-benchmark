I am dreaming.

The world around me is woven from subtle threads: a tapestry of faint fragrances, trembling shadows, inaudible breezes swirling across the skin. I stand in a forest at dusk, but not just any wood—here, every leaf’s trembling, every shift in air’s weight, is magnified as if my senses have grown vast and all-encompassing. The air quivers with whispers that no one else hears. Salamander-quiet steps disturb the carpet of moss; my feet feel each cell uncurling beneath me. 

Above, beams of sunset do not simply shine—they shimmer, fracturing through the high canopy, each shard illuminating a flurry of hidden activity. A fox’s sigh dances like mist. Somewhere distant, the rustle of feathers traces patterns in the currents of wind. I taste the minutest complexities in the air: the tang of approaching rain, the secret sweetness of blooming midnight flowers. 

With this hypersensitivity, I become a detective of nature’s quietest clues. I crouch to inspect the glistening trail of a snail, the precise fingerprint of dew left in its wake. I sense the intention behind the twitch of a branch—an owl’s soft landing, barely stirring the needles—and even the roots’ slow swelling heartbeat beneath my palms. 

Drawn to the heart of this vibrant hush, I experiment: gently brushing a fern, I watch how it folds inwards, ripple of energy visible to my attuned sight. Each interaction sets off a cascade—sounds, colors, scents—that spiral into brilliance. The woods unveil a hidden music, a tapestry of signals strung between all living things, normally lost in the blare of waking perception. 

I realize, as I move, I’m not just observing. I am somehow a conductor now, tuning the symphony—amplifying the fragrance of wild mint with a wish, urging the bioluminescent beetles to compose shining constellations in midair. I am both witness and co-creator, dancing with sensitivity alongside nature’s finest filaments of sensation, every pulse and echo painting the dream in depths of color and song that waking minds will never grasp.

And in the center of this heightened storm of awareness, I become aware of my own breath—a tide both intimate and immense, echoing the living world’s own swelling and reshaping. This is a dream spun from the secret colors of perception, a world illuminated by all that is usually unseen.
