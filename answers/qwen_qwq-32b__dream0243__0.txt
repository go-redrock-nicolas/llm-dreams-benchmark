I am dreaming. The ground beneath me is like a living mosaic, each tile a shimmering quadrant of liquid light. Far ahead, an opalescent tower spirals into a sky streaked with iridescent clouds that sing when the wind passes through them. I walk toward it, my footsteps leaving faint echoes that ripple across the terrain like the splash of a stone on water. As I approach, the tower’s base opens into an arched doorway, glowing with a soft, pulsating gold. Inside, the walls undulate like the skin of some great beast, and the air smells of wild lavender and burnt copper. I ascend the staircase, each step dissolving slightly beneath my feet, as though the tower is reluctant for me to go further. 

Halfway up, I encounter a figure cloaked in shadows, their face obscured by a hood. Their voice is a chorus of whispers in multiple languages, harmonizing and clashing at the same time. “This is a place of thresholds,” they say. “You come seeking answers. Do you have the courage to give your heart, even if it might be broken? Or will you hold it close, only to grieve what might have been?” The figure pauses, and the room’s air thickens with static. “Relationships in the waking world are mazes built from moments—some blazing, some frigid. To navigate them, you must be both anchor and sailor. Do you understand?”

The choice feels electric, a spark in my chest. I decide to speak—my voice steady, though it trembles. “I’ll anchor myself to my own needs, but let the winds of change carry our path. I’ll embrace the warmth when it comes, and shield against the chill, so that neither leaves me unmoored.” The figure’s shadowy form shivers, then shifts into a door leading to a garden. The door opens to a twilight realm where flowers bloom in impossible colors, their petals whispering secrets in a tongue only hearts can comprehend. Above, the sky is alive with constellations that shift and swirl, forming and unforming like dandelion spores in the wind.
