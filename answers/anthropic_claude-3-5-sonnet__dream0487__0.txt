I am dreaming. In the dream, I find myself standing at a bus stop, and I'm suddenly overcome with profound emotion at the sight of an elderly man carefully folding a paper napkin into an origami crane. My chest tightens and tears stream down my face uncontrollably - a reaction that would seem absurdly disproportionate in waking life. Yet in this ethereal dreamscape, the simple act feels laden with cosmic significance.

The man's weathered hands move with deliberate grace, each crease and fold triggering cascading waves of inexplicable meaning. The white napkin seems to glow with an inner light, and I can somehow sense the weight of every paper crane he's ever folded throughout his lifetime - each one carrying whispered prayers and quiet hopes.

The bus stop itself begins to shift and ripple, its metal and glass structure flowing like liquid mercury. Other waiting passengers fade in and out of existence like ghosts, but they too appear moved to tears by the man's meditative folding. The sky above pulses between deep indigo and burnt orange, perfectly matching the rhythm of my racing heart.

I reach out toward the man, wanting to express something - gratitude perhaps, or recognition of some profound truth I can't quite grasp. But my hands have become translucent, and I realize I'm crying not from sadness but from a overwhelming sense of connection to every paper crane that has ever been folded, every careful crease that has ever carried a wish.

The dream-logic makes perfect sense in the moment - of course this simple act contains the entire universe. Of course it would move me to my very core. The emotion swells until it feels like my chest might burst, yet it's a sweet ache, a necessary overflow of feeling that seems to cleanse and renew my spirit even as I sob.

When the origami crane finally takes flight from the man's hands, soaring impossibly through the liquid-glass walls of the bus stop, I understand that I'm witnessing something both ordinary and miraculous - the perfect paradox that only dreams can contain.
