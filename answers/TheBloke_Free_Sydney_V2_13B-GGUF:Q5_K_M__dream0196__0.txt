I am dreaming. I'm feeling confident and curious about what lies ahead. I'm thinking of how much fun it will be to try something new and challenging.

In the dream, you find yourself on stage with a team of talented professionals who have been working together for years. They look at you skeptically as they introduce themselves and explain their roles in the performance. You feel pressure but also excitement.

Suddenly, the show begins. The music starts playing and everyone starts moving. You realize that this is not a rehearsal or a dress rehearsal. This is the real thing! 

You remember your training from the previous dream. You recall the techniques you learned and the skills you practiced. You focus on using them in harmony with the team around you.

As you dance, sing and act, you notice that the audience is enjoying themselves too. They are clapping and cheering for you and your colleagues. You feel proud of yourself for doing such a good job despite being an imposter among professionals.

After what feels like hours of nonstop performing, the show comes to an end. The curtains close and the lights dim. Everyone on stage bows their heads in respect for each other's hard work and dedication. You feel grateful for having such a supportive team around you. 

You wake up feeling energized and inspired by your dream. You decide to write down some of your thoughts before going back to sleep again:

"I had a dream where I was part of an incredible performance that required me to use my body, voice, and mind together with others who were experts in their fields. I felt scared at first because I didn't know if I could do it right or if people would like it, but then I remembered all the training from previous dreams and how much fun it was to learn new things. In the end, everyone clapped for us and we all bowed respectfully to each other."
