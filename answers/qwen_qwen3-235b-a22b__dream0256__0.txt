I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The sky is a bruised canvas of liquid mercury, swirling with clouds that drip indigo lightning. Rain falls in slow motion, each droplet glowing faintly as it strikes the cobblestones of a city that doesn’t exist—a labyrinth of crooked spires, neon signs flickering like dying fireflies, and alleyways that hum with forgotten lullabies. The air smells of burnt honey and ozone. You’re barefoot, though you don’t remember removing your shoes, and the ground pulses faintly beneath your soles, as if the earth itself is breathing.  

A figure emerges from the storm. Their coat is a patchwork of shadows and moth-eaten velvet, fraying at the edges into smoke. Their face is obscured, shifting like a half-remembered face in a crowd—sometimes young, sometimes old, sometimes a mosaic of faces layered atop one another. Their hands, when they reach out, are skeletal yet warm, palms cradling a hollow where a heart might beat.  

“Help me,” they say, but the words aren’t spoken—they bloom inside your skull like a burst of static, carrying the weight of a thousand whispered prayers. In their eyes, which flicker like candle flames, you see entire lifetimes: a child building sandcastles at the edge of a receding sea, a soldier dropping their weapon to cradle a wounded enemy, a star collapsing into a black hole.  

Around you, the crowd surges like a school of silver fish, faceless and frantic, their umbrellas slicing the air like blades. They don’t see the figure—or perhaps they do, and have chosen not to. A woman in a blood-red dress steps over a puddle that reflects not the sky, but a desert under twin suns. A man in a suit made of clock gears mutters equations that dissolve into crows mid-air. No one stops.  

You kneel.  

Your hands, trembling, grasp the only thing in your pocket: a coin etched with a serpent eating its own tail. It’s not yours. You don’t know where it came from. The figure’s fingers brush yours, and suddenly the rain stops. The world holds its breath. The coin glows, then *sings*—a low, resonant note that vibrates in your molars. Their coat unravels, revealing a body made of constellations, each star a tiny door to another dimension.  

“You’ve chosen,” they say, their voice now a chorus of bells and breaking waves. “Now witness.”  

The city dissolves. You’re standing on a bridge woven from violin strings, suspended over an abyss where galaxies swirl like cream in coffee. The homeless figure is gone, replaced by a towering entity with antlers of stained glass and wings of shattered mirrors. In its hands, it cradles the lives of everyone who rushed past—each one a flickering candle, snuffed out in an instant. But yours? Yours it places gently into a nest of origami cranes, each folded from pages of your childhood diary.  

Then the dream fractures.  

You wake up gasping, the taste of copper on your tongue, the faint echo of that singing coin in your bones. On your palm, a single star-shaped scar glimmers, then fades. Somewhere, in the real world, a storm still rages. But you swear you hear footsteps outside your door—slow, deliberate, and heading toward you.
