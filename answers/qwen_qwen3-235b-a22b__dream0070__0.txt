I am dreaming. Drifting through the veil where thought and fantasy entwine like lovers in the mist, I find myself not as the person I know, but as a figure carved from diplomacy and shadow. The air is charged with the weight of silence and centuries-old grudges.

I stand in a chamber unlike any I have seen, the Hall of Whispers Upon Ashen Waters. Its architecture is a paradox—walls carved from abalone shells that gleam with iridescent fury, and ceilings woven with threads of starlight and forgotten constellations. It floats on a lake made entirely of still ink, reflecting not images but memories of empire and war, ghosts trailing by like smoke caught mid-sob.

Opposite me sit three figures—each the embodied echo of our most ancient adversaries: the Iron Chancellor of the Frostbound Dominion, her bones layered and welded like a samurai’s armor; the Ember Minister from the Lowlands of Flame, their eyes molten and unblinking; and the Sea-Speaker of the Nomadic Tides, eyes lined with pearls and fingers trailing with salted seaweed, though the ocean is days distant.

Our nations share soil torn by blood and sabotage. Not a border, but a scar. And now, I, an accidental emissary of hope, must weave peace from threads of fury before the summit fractures into open war.

We speak, but not with words. Not entirely. In dreams, language is not linear—it is emotion stretched taut into symbols, gesture, and memory. My dreamscape becomes our window. As the conversation stalls, the ink beneath us ripples, and unseen forces lift the lake into spirals of liquid glass. From the undulating surface rise visions of history: burning harvests, broken treaties, oceans painted black with oil and old sorrow.

I reach into the dream’s deep well and pull forth another memory—my own. When I was a child, I watched soldiers from both sides kneel to give water to a stray dog under a blistering sun. It was unspoken, unrecorded, but it was humanity among mercenaries. I offer this image to the room like an ember pulled from the edge of frost.

The Iron Chancellor softens—if only a flicker of metallic sheen becomes slightly warmer. “Kindness that does not align with law,” she murmurs through a mouth unaccustomed to things softer than command, “does it matter?”

I reply, not in challenge, but invitation. “Sometimes the cracks in law are where light gets in.”

The air shifts. The Sea-Speaker sings a lullaby from the now-drowned island of Varethell, a heritage each nation claims and none saved. The song shimmers, and the ink beneath the chamber stirs again, but this time it forms not sorrow, but possibility—a new border, imagined not in maps but in trust drawn fragile and strange from the dream like breath from cold air.

Just as resolutions begin to form from shadow and second-chances… everything shatters.

Warhorn nightmares bellow in the distance—perhaps summoned by doubt, or maybe by someone unwilling to forgive. The summit trembles.

My role here is not finished.

And so I rise, not as delegate or dreamer, but as a builder of vision—for tomorrow is only what we dare imagine into being.
