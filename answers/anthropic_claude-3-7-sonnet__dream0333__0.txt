I am dreaming. I'm standing on the observation deck of a lighthouse, the air thick with salt and anticipation. Below me, the ocean swells in midnight blues and silver flecks, moonlight dancing across its restless surface. The coastal town sleeps under a blanket of mist, lights twinkling like earthbound stars.

Then I see her—a woman in a flowing white dress, hair wild in the wind, purposefully walking toward the edge of the northern cliffs. In her hands she clutches a letter, tear-stained and crumpled. Even from this distance, I recognize Emily, the lighthouse keeper's daughter.

The knowledge sits heavy in my chest: the letter she holds contains only half-truths. I know because I saw her lover's ship return safely to the harbor on the southern side of the peninsula just hours ago. The storm had merely delayed him, not claimed him as the missive suggests. Thomas is alive, searching the town for her even now, his ring still in his pocket.

My throat tightens. The spiral staircase leading down from the lighthouse seems impossibly long. If I call out, the wind will steal my voice. If I run, the distance might be too great.

Time slows as Emily approaches the cliff's edge, her silhouette becoming one with the mist and stars. Knowledge burns within me—should I intervene in what feels like a private moment of grief, or respect what seems to be her choice? The boundary between observer and participant blurs like the horizon at dawn.

I feel my legs moving before my mind decides, feet clattering down the metal steps, lungs burning with the cold night air. The boundary between dream and dreamer dissolves as I become both the runner and the witness to my running.

The cliff edge draws closer as both Emily and I race toward different destinies, connected by a truth only one of us holds.
