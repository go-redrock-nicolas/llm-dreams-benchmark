I am dreaming. …standing in the hush that follows thunder, as though the sky itself has forgotten to breathe.

The dream around me is a city spun from moon-glass and mirrored rivers. Pale towers coil upward like frozen fountains, their surfaces catching stray constellations that drift far too close, as if the heavens have slipped a little in their sleep. Somewhere overhead, a leviathan-shaped cloud glides by, stitched together from scraps of storm and starlight.

Then the tragedy erupts.

Without warning, the tallest tower fractures with a sound like a violin string snapping at the horizon. A single crystalline shard breaks free, plummeting in slow, dreadful grace. In that suspended instant the shard is beautiful—catching every glimmer, refracting the city into a kaleidoscope. Yet everyone below sees what will follow: the shard will strike the square where a lantern festival is underway, where laughter is already turning into thin, disbelieving cries.

Time releases its chokehold. The shard meets stone. A flash of prismatic shrapnel bursts outward like a silent firework, and the ground trembles with an almost musical rumble. Lanterns burst, their tiny flames scattering into the night like frightened fireflies. I hear cobblestones cracking, and distant, echoing screams become a mournful choir that fills every corridor of the crystal city.

People drop to their knees, clutching at loved ones, at strangers—some searching the debris for a familiar hand, others simply howling at the uncaring glow of the towers. Faces are wet with tears and shimmering dust. Grief ricochets from wall to wall, amplifying itself until it is nearly a physical pressure, a tidal wave of anguish threatening to shove the dream off its axis.

And yet I am utterly still.

My heartbeat has slowed to a measured drum, steady amid the discord. I feel the sorrow—sharp, clean, undeniable—but it does not scatter me the way it scatters the crowd. It settles instead into the marrow of my bones, cool and luminous like moonlight trapped in crystal. I find myself breathing it in, the way one might breathe the scent of rain before it breaks.

A displaced child wanders near, cheeks streaked with tears, clutching half of a shattered paper lantern whose wire halo flickers with ember-flecked light. I kneel beside them. My calm does not chase their grief away, but it steadies the trembling of their shoulders. Around us, people notice; they draw closer, gathering as though my quiet is a lamp in a sudden darkness.

I lift the child’s broken lantern, and a thin, stubborn ember still glows at its center. I cup it with my hands, shielding it from the whip of cold wind. The ember flares, fed by nothing but intention. It rises, brightening, until it becomes a small floating sphere of soft gold.

Gasps ripple through the onlookers. Some reach out to it with hesitant hands, as if they’ve remembered that miracles, however fragile, can be coaxed from wreckage. I release the sphere; it drifts upward, pausing where the fractured tower once dazzled the night. Slowly, as if persuaded by the ember’s glow, other sparks lift themselves from the rubble—shorn lantern lights, bits of scattered starlight, the city’s own reflective dust. They gather into a constellation of living embers, each wobbling with fresh purpose.

A hush settles. Eyes dry, chests un-clench. The crowd is still wounded, but the gaping edge of despair has begun to seal. In the mirrored river I glimpse our reflection: a wide circle of people under an expanding canopy of soft, drifting lights, as though the shattered sky has decided to mend itself in miniature.

Within me, the cool moonlit sorrow persists, but it is tempered by a growing warmth—a realization that calm can be as contagious as panic, that the heart can pool grief and still distill grace. The city is broken, yes, yet all around me the lights rise higher, weaving together into something new, something not unscarred but undeniably alive.

I wake with a final image: a once-fractured tower reborn as an aurora of floating lanterns, and a whispered certainty lingering on my tongue—

Even in dreams, we can choose to be the still point around which hope begins to revolve.
