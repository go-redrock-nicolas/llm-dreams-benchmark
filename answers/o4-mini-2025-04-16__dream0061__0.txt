I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You stand backstage in a cathedral-like auditorium carved from pale moonstone and drifting mist. The air hums with the low resonance of unseen choir voices, and every breath tastes faintly of ozone and ink. Above you, colossal stained-glass vaults depict impossible constellations: spirals of silver stars, rivers of molten gold, and constellations that pulse like living organisms. The panel of experts sits before you on a dais of polished obsidian: each face half-lit by candlelight, their eyes like dark pools reflecting your own anxieties back at you.

In your hands is the manuscript of your life’s work—every page once pristine, now flecked with smudges of crimson and sapphire. As you flip to page seven, you realize lines you once believed flawless have twisted themselves into gibberish: theorem symbols loop into infinity, paragraphs fragment into stuttering echoes, and diagrams bleed off the edges of the sheets. Your heart thunks like a drum inside your chest. You can feel your pulse humming along with the cathedral’s hidden choir.

You step forward onto the stage’s mirrored floor. Each footfall ripples the surface, sending star-like sparks dancing outward. Behind you, the cathedral walls dissolve into a shifting tableau: galaxies swirl into whirlpools, trees of glass sprout roots from the air, and giant clock-hands orbit you like celestial bodies. The panel leans in. One expert—a woman whose silver hair floats as though underwater—raises an eyebrow. A low murmur ripples through the candlelit silence.

Panic flares in your belly, but you force yourself to inhale. You rearrange your scattered sheets on a lectern of living crystal, attempting to mask the errors. Your fingers come away sticky, as though you’ve been handling honey rather than paper. The crystals hum in response, refracting your frantic movements into prisms of fear. Your voice, when you speak, cracks like ancient wood. The words you’d rehearsed splinter into half-formed thoughts.

Suddenly, the cathedral’s dome quakes, and a torrent of ink rains down—each droplet sizzling on the mirror stage. The ink forms fractal patterns that swirl toward the panel, threatening to blot out their faces. You close your eyes, will your work to right itself. A single, pure note—a child’s laughter, perhaps—rises from somewhere deep within your memory. It resonates with the crystalline lectern, and the storm of ink pauses in mid-air.

When you open your eyes, the pages have reassembled themselves: errors healed, symbols shining with renewed clarity. The panel sits motionless but not unkind. The woman with silver hair nods once, just enough to grant you permission. You draw a trembling breath and begin your presentation anew. As each word leaves your lips, the stained-glass constellations rearrange themselves into your core theories, illuminating the dome in glorious relief. In that moment, all fear dissolves into wonder—and you realize that in the deepest, most chaotic edges of your mind lies the very spark of creation.
