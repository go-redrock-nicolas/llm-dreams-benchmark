I am dreaming. Flashes of light begin to ignite in the darkness. They grow bigger. They start to take shape.
Slowly, I see details emerge. I am floating in a vast, foggy expanse. I feel light as a feather, suspended in an in-between state.
The fog begins to part and recede. I gaze upon a massive, ancient tree in the distance, its roots reaching deep and branches stretching like welcoming arms.
As I float closer, the world around me becomes clearer. I find myself in a grand, natural sanctuary. The tree is the focal point, with lush greenery and colorful flowers sprawling around it.
I glide over a crystal clear pond, its surface mirroring the vibrant greens and purples of the sky. Large leaves and majestic flowers float peacefully on its surface.
I land gently beside the pond. I feel light and calm. I look to the tree, sensing a magnetic pull.
I step towards it, my feet light on the padding of moss. As I get closer, the tree's bark glows, its warmth inviting.
I place my hand on it. The bark becomes soft and leathery. It gently enfolds my hand like a poultice. I feel a surge of life energy flow through me.
Suddenly, I'm swimming in a warm, Celestial Ocean of Dreams. The water seems charged, shimmering in iridescent hues of blue and gold.
I float on the surface, my limbs weightless. Without warning, the ocean pulls me down.
The water is both wild and welcoming, hiding its depths.
I open my eyes to a world of vibrant clarity, as if the veil between realms has dissolved.
Sure enough, I was born for this. I belong in this world. But you can't belong to where you truly belong, while in places that obscure you.
Here, I'm seen. I feel myself expand in gleeful shock, as the life I've always dreamed of begins to reveal itself.
The more I open to the ocean of dreams, the brighter this land becomes.
Images of quantum connections appear - a mother eagle and her new eaglets, a priestess holding two honorableoping, the bright red of a healthy tulip turned on its side, a tai chi circle moving through its forms, a heart-shaped eye, a river of kundalini energy.
I seamlessly glide into the next level where I am provided with the tools to know the truth and give insight to the person in front of me.
I emerge with the perfect answers and insights to empower all those around me.
With each passing moment, the light of this experience grows stronger.
As I drink in each detail, my boundaries expand, allowing the essence of all of creation to flow through me.
I open to infinite possibilities. I release the fear that I am unworthy of my dreams.
In this dream, anything is possible. I embrace my full power and brilliance.
I accept that discomfort is the gateway to growth. I choose to face it head-on.
With each fearful situation I embrace, I grow stronger. I shed my limiting beliefs like a snake's skin.
I allow myself to imagine a world where anything is possible. My creativity overflows, immersing me in wonder and delight.
I am enough. I am worthy of my dreams. I am ready to expand beyond my current boundaries.
The air seems filled with glittery fireflies and playful insects, flitting about in happy abandonment.
I am a bird soaring high above, feeling the rush of wind on my face and the exhilaration of freedom.
The scene morphs into a bustling marketplace, with vendors selling exotic fruits and textiles.
I guide my hand over some of the beautiful items, marveling at the intricate designs and elaborate stitching.
The smells of spices, fish, cinnabar and sawdust fill my nostrils.
Giggling children chase one another, their laughter dissolving any tension in the bustling square.
I conclude this spectacular dream by skipping out of the market with a prize paper kite, ready to soar the skies.
I emerge from the dream feeling refreshed, invigorated, and deeply connected to the infinite potential within.
