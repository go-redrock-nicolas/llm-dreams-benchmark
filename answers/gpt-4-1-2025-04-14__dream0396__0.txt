I am dreaming.

A ripple of waking awareness glides through the gently undulating landscape of my mind, and I become acutely aware: the clockwork march of seconds and minutes has dissolved. I can feel each breath slipping through me like the rise and fall of a tide that is not tethered to the moon. Sometimes, one moment stretches—a golden thread suspended between the worlds—so long and languid that I can wander within it for what feels like hours, perhaps years.

I am standing at the threshold of a lush, ever-changing forest. With every step forward, the foliage shivers and shifts: time expands at my will, and I stroll leisurely through sunbeams that thicken until they seem tangible, heavy drops of honeyed light pooling at my feet. Birds flit overhead, their wings slow in the syrupy air, each featherbeat echoing like distant thunder. In the hush, I perceive the delicate cracking of a flower bud on the verge of bloom—a single heartbeat becoming an eternity as I observe each petal unfurl, tinged with the iridescent hues of sunset.

Suddenly, curiosity alights within me, and the tempo shifts. My focus narrows, sharp and crystalline, and the scenery blurs, accelerating around me. The trees seem to dance backwards and forwards, seasons spinning like dancers in colored skirts: green bursts into flame-orange, then falls away into the pale bones of winter, before blossoming back to plush vernal abundance. Within this dizzying corridor of time, my thoughts flicker and multiply, hundreds of me darting through memories and wonderings, like schools of luminous fish in a bottomless sea.

I sense, deep into the marrow of this dream, that the fabric of time is supple, quicksilver, and my consciousness is both loom and shuttle. When I yearn for meaning, time balloons: I can hear the soft hum of the earth’s rotation, the secret, patient workings of stones becoming sand. When desire stirs, time contracts, galvanized and quick—a flicker, a spark leaping between synapses.

At the heart of this exploration, I realize that my perception is the true architect of time’s rhythm. I am lucid, present, a nimble dancer weaving between vast epochs and minuscule moments, shaping the dream’s strange symphony. And as the dream deepens, I carry this knowledge gently with me, the whisper that time is not a cage but a canvas—ready for the next stroke of wonder.
