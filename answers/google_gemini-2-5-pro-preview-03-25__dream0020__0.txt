I am dreaming. Okay, the dream haze settles... Here I am.

You are dreaming.

You're invited to a reunion with people you haven't seen in years. Some relationships were left with unresolved tensions, frayed edges dangling like loose threads on a beloved but worn tapestry. As you enter the venue, you find yourself pushing through, not a door, but a heavy, velvet curtain the colour of twilight, surprisingly cool and smooth beneath your fingertips. It parts silently, revealing a space that immediately feels both vast and strangely intimate.

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, vibrating deep within your chest. It smells faintly of rain on hot pavement, old books, and something sweet and unplaceable, perhaps honeysuckle blooming out of season. The venue isn't a hall or a ballroom as you might have expected; instead, it resembles an ancient, sprawling conservatory overgrown with luminous flora. Giant, glowing ferns unfurl lazily in corners, casting shifting patterns of ethereal blue and green light across the scene. Vines dripping with what look like tiny, captured stars hang from an unseen ceiling, obscured by swirling mists the colour of amethyst and rose gold.

Music drifts through the air, but it's fragmented, like snippets of half-remembered songs played on water glasses and distant chimes, occasionally punctuated by the melancholic sigh of a cello. Pockets of people are gathered throughout this luminous jungle. Their faces flicker in and out of focus, familiar contours blurring slightly at the edges as if viewed through moving water. Laughter rings out, sometimes sounding warm and genuine, other times echoing with a brittle, slightly unnerving edge.

A knot tightens in your stomach – a confusing cocktail of eager anticipation and cold dread. Your eyes scan the scattered groups, searching for specific faces, bracing yourself. You see glimpses: the curve of a particular smile you once knew so well, now directed at someone else; the distinctive way someone gestures with their hands while talking, their fingers trailing faint sparks of light; the back of a head, the set of shoulders so achingly familiar it makes your breath catch.

Then, across a small clearing where glowing moss carpets the floor, you spot *them*. Amelia. She’s standing near a fountain that seems to pour liquid moonlight instead of water. She isn’t looking your way, seemingly engrossed in conversation with someone whose face is completely obscured by shadow, yet the old, unresolved static crackles in the dream-air between you, an invisible, taut wire humming with years of unspoken words and lingering hurt. Her posture is stiffer than you remember, and the light catches the silver threads in her hair you never knew she had. The air around her seems slightly cooler, the luminous plants nearby subtly dimming their glow. Your feet feel rooted to the spot, the desire to turn and flee warring fiercely with the magnetic pull of the unfinished past. The dream holds you there, suspended in that charged moment, the glowing foliage pulsing gently around you like a slow, steady heartbeat.
