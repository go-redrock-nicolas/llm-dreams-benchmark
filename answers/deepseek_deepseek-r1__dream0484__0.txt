I am dreaming. I'm stepping into a vast, luminous library where every book is an embodiment of my memories.  My hand brushes against a leather-bound tome labeled "Incompetent: A Chronicle of Failure." But as I pull it from the shelf, the pages crumble into fireflies, dissolving the lie that I was never enough.  And all around me, the shelves dissolve into light, into possibility.

In the shimmering expanse of this dream-library, the air hums with whispers of half-remembered truths. Your fingertips hover over the disintegrating book, watching ink swirl into constellations. Suddenly the floor becomes liquid glass beneath your feet, mirroring your reflection—not as you’ve always seen yourself, but radiant, unburdened. A stairwell spirals upward where the shelves once stood, each step carved from questions you dared not ask before: *What if your stumbles were grace? What if the dark corners held wings?*

At the summit, a door pulses like a hummingbird’s throat. You push through into a meadow where the grass sings. Each blade vibrates with colors unnamed in waking life—symphonies of gold, sorrow-azure, laughter-crimson. Creatures woven from shadow and starlight curl around your ankles, guiding you to a well at the meadow’s heart. Its waters show not your face, but scenes: you as a child building cities from mud, fierce and grinning. You at eighty, laughing with a voice that shakes the pines. You, *now*, but freer. 

A storm brews on the horizon—old fears, clawed and hissing. But the ground answers. Roots surge upward, not to cage, but to cradle. They weave into a throne of living wood, and the wind carries a single word: *Enough.* Not as absolution, but as anthem. The storm shatters into cherry blossoms. When you wake, your pillow smells of petrichor and possibility, the kind that lingers.
