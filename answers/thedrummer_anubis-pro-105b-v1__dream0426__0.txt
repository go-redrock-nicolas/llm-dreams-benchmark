I am dreaming. find myself standing at the edge of a dark and mystical forest, the moon casting eerie shadows on the gnarled branches above. The air is heavy with a sense of foreboding, a symbol of the turmoil brewing within my mind. With each step forward, I feel the weight of selflessness bearing down on me, a constant companions that has been my burden for far too long.

As I venture deeper into the forest, the trees grow taller and the shadows darker. I can hear the distant howls of wolves, their haunting/n cries a reflection of my own inner struggle, I continue to walk, but the forest seems to stretch out before me endlessly, a reflection of the never-ending promise of "just one more sacrifice."

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows. The figure is shrouded in mist, but as it draws closer, I realize it is myself, or at least, a version of myself. This alternate self looks tired, worn down by the constant giving and sacrificing. I reach out a hand, and as our fingers intertwine to speak to me in a voice that echoes through my mind. "Why do you 

"You are worthy," I tell myself, my voice barely above a whisper. "You deserve to be seen, to be heard, to be valued." The words reverberate through the forest, and as they do, I begin to feel a shift. The trees seem to stand taller, the shadows receding as the moon shines brighter. The howls of the wolves fade away, replaced by the sweet calls of songbirds. I know then that I am free. Free to be me, to chase my dreams, free to find happiness. Freed from the chains of selflessness that once held me captive.
