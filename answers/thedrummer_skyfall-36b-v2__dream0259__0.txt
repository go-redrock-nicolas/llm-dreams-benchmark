I am dreaming. The visages of my loved ones swirl around me in a kaleidoscope of emotions, but one face stands out - your face. Your eyes, usually sparkling with joy and warmth, are now glistening with tears, the pain in them striking me like a dagger to the heart. Guilt wraps its icy tendrils around me, squeezing tight until I can barely breathe.

The scene shifts, and I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, tranquil lake at dusk. The water's surface is a mirror, reflecting the burning orange and pink hues of the setting sun. But as I gaze into the depths, I see myself, distorted and grotesque, the face of a monster who has hurt the one I love most.

Suddenly, a gentle breeze carries your voice to me, soft and broken. "Why?" you whisper, your sorrow an audible crack in the night air. The sound tears at my soul, making me want to flee, to run far and fast. But I can't move. I'm rooted to the spot, frozen by my own shackles of regret.

The landscape around me transforms once more. Now I'm in a small, cozy cottage, the kind from my childhood. I'm curled up on a sopping wet fluffy bed, rocking myself to sleep, trying to escape the dreams that no longer let me rest. I see your face again, but now it's filled with hope, a smile stretching across your features.

Warm hands encircle me, pulling me close and shushing me gently. I feel your breath, warm and calming, as you pull me under the covers softly. "It's okay," you whisper, the tears now gone from your eyes, replaced by a warmth that I thought I lost. "It's okay."

I open my eyes and see that it's all been a dream. 

A dream that taught me the true weight of my actions and the depth of my love for you.
