I am dreaming. I am floating in a vast field of pure gold sunlight. Suddenly I have the ability to see people around me, each of them properly glowing with their own unique color representation of their aura. 

As I observe a young woman approaching me, I notice her aura is a vibrant emerald green, interwoven with threads of deep indigo. Something about her presence makes me uncomfortable, but the colors of her aura are soothing and peaceful.

Intrigued, I move closer to observe her intentions. The emerald green part seems to emanate a feeling of compassion and love, but the indigo gives off an aura of deception. She interacts with others delicately, sweetly even, but somehow her actions seem artificial. 

As these observations pass through my mind, I realize the discomfort I feel stems from recognizing in her a trait that I despise in myself—shallowness. The deception inherent in her actions towards others reflects a pattern I had observed in my own behavior but previously failed to acknowledge.

Upon recognizing this, I recall a lesson from my therapy sessions – projection. I tend to be much more critical of others exhibiting a trait I dislike in myself. Recognizing this projection pattern is the first step towards understanding and accepting my own emotions, and ultimately, embracing my vulnerability.

In the dream, the comprehension of this pattern brings forth a wave of relief. As I accept this realization, the young woman's aura shifts. Her emerald green aura intensifies, encompassing her entire being, and the threads of deep indigo dissipate into the golden sunlight that bathes the field.
