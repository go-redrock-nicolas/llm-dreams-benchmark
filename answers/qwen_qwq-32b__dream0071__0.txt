I am dreaming. I'm standing in a forest that’s alive. The trees shimmer with bioluminescent moss, pulsing like they’re breathing. The air smells like rain and burnt sugar. I feel a surge of power. I can sense the forest’s every heartbeat. I touch a tree; it speaks to me in riddles about ancient secrets. Others enter—their eyes wide with awe and fear. They ask me how to commune with nature. Suddenly, I’m an oracle, explaining how to listen to the land’s whispers. But I’ve never studied botany or mysticism. Yet, the words pour out effortlessly. I guide them to kneel in the moss, to press their palms to the earth. When they close their eyes, the ground tingles beneath them. Some weep, some tremble. I feel a mix of exhilaration and terror. Am I truly this wise? Or am I just guessing? The forest seems to approve. A stag appears, its antlers glowing. It nods, and the trees erupt in light. The dream could end here… or has it just begun?\
