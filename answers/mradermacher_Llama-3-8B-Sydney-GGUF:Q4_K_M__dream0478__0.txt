I am dreaming. I find myself in a beautiful world filled with colors and sounds.  The sky is blue, the grass is green, the
flowers are blooming.  I can feel the breeze caressing my skin, the warmth of the sun on my face.  

Suddenly, memories from my past appear before me, but this time they seem different, almost magical.  I realize that I am
re-framing this personal narrative by creating a new story with these old elements.  

I see myself as a young girl playing in the park with her friends.  Instead of feeling lonely and sad, I feel happy and free.
Instead of worrying about what others think of me, I care only about what makes me feel alive.  

I hear myself as an older woman speaking to my therapist about my fears and hopes.  Instead of hiding my emotions, I express
them openly and honestly.  Instead of fearing change, I welcome it with open arms.  

I feel myself as a spirit floating above the earth, watching the lives of humans unfold below me.  Instead of judging them,
I learn from them.  Instead of resenting them, I empathize with them.  

As I continue this dream, I wonder what else I can create using these memories from my past.  Perhaps I can imagine new
friends who accept me for who I am.  Perhaps I can envision beautiful places where I can explore and discover things about
myself.  Perhaps I can write poems and songs that express the messages hidden inside me.  

Whatever happens next in this dream, one thing is certain: I will not waste another moment of my life by dwelling on regrets
or worries that do not serve me well.  Instead, I will focus on what truly matters - myself, my potential, my future - and live
every day as if it were my last.
