I am dreaming. As I step onto the stage, a hush falls over the massive crowd before me. The auditorium is an architectural marvel, with soaring ceilings and twinkling chandeliers. Plush red curtains frame the stage, and the smell of polished wood and old leather permeates the air. I can see the anticipation in the eyes of the audience members as they shift in their seats, eagerly awaiting my words.

I take a deep breath, smoothing the lapels of my perfectly tailored tuxedo. The microphone in front of me stands tall and imposing, a silver tower that will carry my voice to the far reaches of the room. I can feel the weight of a thousand pairs of eyes upon me, their gaze intense and unwavering.

Then, the moment for which I have been preparing, the reason I am here at all. With a gentle reach, I take hold of the microphone.

But suddenly, the world around me begins to shift and warp. The stage beneath my feet cracks and crumbles, and the audience members start to meld together, transforming into a writhing mass of flesh and grotesque shapes. The chandeliers shatter, raining down shards of razor-sharp crystal upon the assembly. A chorus of screams erupts from the crowd as they scramble to flee, but the exits have sealed themselves shut, trapping us all within this nightmare.

I stumble backward, my confidence crumbling along with the stage. The microphone slips from my grasp, clattering to the ground a few feet away. As I bend down to retrieve it, I hear a low, menacing laugh echoing through the auditorium. I look up, and what I see fills me with unspeakable horror.

Rising from the center of the crackling stage is an enormous, corrupted figure. Its skin is a mottled mess of green and black, glistening with some kind of pulsating fluid, and its eyes are two red portals to an abyss of despair. Lashing at its sides are eight writhing, snake-like limbs, each one ending in a row of fornicationally sharp fangs. The creature's mouth splits open wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth and a viscous, oozing throat.

I feel terror clamp around my heart, squeezing the breath from my lungs. Every fiber of my being screams at me to run, but my feet are rooted to the spot, as if trapped in a tar pit of primal dread. The monstrosity starts to advance toward me, its movement slow and purposeful, like a predator toying with its prey.

Just as the creature is mere inches from my face, I wake with a jolt, my body drenched in cold sweat. For a moment, I cannot breathe, the terror from the dream still consuming me. Slowly, reality begins to filter back in, and I realize I am safe in my own bed, my room familiar and comforting. But the fear lingers, a claustrophobic shadow on my consciousness, as I wonder what other horrors my mind will conjure up next during the deep night.
