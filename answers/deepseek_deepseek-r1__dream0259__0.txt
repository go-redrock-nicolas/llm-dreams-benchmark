I am dreaming. In the shifting, velveteen shadows of the dream, the air itself seems to hum with the weight of unsaid words. The person you cherish stands before you, their silhouette etched in the trembling light of a dying candle. Their eyes—once warm pools of starlight—now glisten with a silver sheen of tears, refracting your reflection into a thousand shattered fragments. You reach out, but your hand passes through them like smoke, and the guilt coils around your ribs, serpentine and cold, pressing until your breath hitches.

The ground beneath you dissolves into a mosaic of memories: laughter tangled in sunlit meadows, whispered confessions under moth-wing skies, the brush of fingers that once felt like coming home. But each shard of the past now bites into your skin, sharp with the irony of how carelessly you’ve tread upon them. Their voice echoes, not in words, but in the hollow resonance of a windchime in a storm—broken, dissonant. 

Around you, the dream twists. Walls bleed ink-black vines that bloom with accusations, petals unfurling into syllables of "How could you?" The air thickens with the scent of wilted roses and burnt sugar, a nauseating reminder of sweetness turned cloying, love curdled into regret. You try to speak, to mend, but your voice is swallowed by the creeping fog, every apology dissolving before it takes shape.

And then, silence. The figure turns away, their form unraveling into fireflies that scatter like embers from a snuffed flame. You are left kneeling in a field of ash, the sky above a bruise-purple twilight, whispering a truth you already know: some fractures never truly mend. They simply become part of the map of who you are.
