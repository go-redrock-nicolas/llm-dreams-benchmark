I am dreaming. You stand at the edge of a crystalline shore, where the sand glimmers like crushed diamonds under a sky that pulses with auroras in hues never seen awake—violet blending into molten gold, then into a green so deep it feels alive. The ocean before you breathes, its waves lapping in slow, syrupy undulations. You wade in, and the water clings to your skin, each droplet humming with the resonance of a thousand distant stars. Time stretches like taffy here. Seconds drip like honey, each one lingering long enough to taste—notes of sunlight, laughter, and forgotten memories.

But then, as your fingers brush a school of bioluminescent fish darting in impossible fractal patterns, time splinters. The world accelerates. The auroras streak like comet tails, the waves churn into froth and frenzy, and the stars overhead blur into silver ribbons. Your heartbeat thunders, syncing with the rhythm of a celestial drum. Moments crash into you like meteor showers—fleeting, brilliant, overwhelming.

You stumble back, and the world shifts again. Now you’re in a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting versions of yourself frozen in different instances: a child clutching a wilting dandelion, a figure mid-laugh with eyes squeezed shut, a silhouette vanishing into a doorway of shadow. Time isn’t linear here—it’s a prism. You reach out, and your touch sends ripples through the glass, merging past and future into a kaleidoscopic *now*. 

A voice, neither male nor female but resonant as a bell, whispers: *"You are the lens. Sharpen your focus, and eternity collapses. Blur it, and it expands."* The mirrors dissolve into a rain of silver petals, and you wake—not with a start, but as though emerging from a breath held too long, the dream’s afterglow still bending the light in your room.
