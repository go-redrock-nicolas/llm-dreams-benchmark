I am dreaming. You slip beneath the surface of sleep, and suddenly you stand at the edge of a forest bathed in twilight. The air hums with a soft electric thrum, and vines of glowing teal wrap around ancient trunks, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. Each footstep on the mossy ground sends ripples of color through the fog—sometimes a fierce crimson when your pulse races, sometimes a calm lavender when your breathing slows. You realize that your own emotions are painting this forest, and that every flutter of dread or spark of joy shifts the light and the scent around you.

You step forward, curiosity rising as you notice a narrow path crossing a shallow pool of liquid silver. When you hesitate, the surface quivers and shows you a memory: the warmth of a childhood holiday, laughter echoing off smoky kitchen tiles. You feel that same swell of comfort now, almost more powerful than it should be. Your heart aches with longing and delight, and the vision drains away in a shimmer of stardust. You press on, intrigued by how alive this place is to your feelings—and how it magnifies them.

Ahead, a great archway of black iron twists into the shape of an open mouth. Beyond it, a long hall of mirrors awaits. You cross the threshold, and each mirror you pass reveals a different facet of yourself: one shows tears pooling in your eyes at the gentlest breeze of music; another catches you grinning so wildly your cheeks ache. One mirror fractures your image into shards—here, anger drips like molten gold, there, fear hovers as fragile as glass. Though unsettling, each vision pulls you forward, beckoning you to acknowledge emotions you usually push away.

At the end of the hall, a solitary door of translucent crystal stands slightly ajar. You push it open and enter a vast chamber where a colossal butterfly flutters inside a dome of moonlight. Its wings sparkle with all the colors you felt moments ago—joy’s bright yellow, fear’s deep indigo, sorrow’s soft blue. It lands on a pedestal shaped like an open heart, and you understand: these feelings are not enemies to banish but living companions to learn from. You reach out, and as your fingers brush the butterfly’s wing, you feel a surge of empathy and resolve, as if your capacity to feel deeply is a kind of hidden strength.

Without warning, the dome dissolves into swirls of mist, and you find yourself drifting upward—past the treetops, above the mirrored hall, back out over the shimmering pool. The forest recedes, and sunlight filters in. You wake with your chest aglow, carrying an unexpected tenderness for every emotion that rose in your dream. Though the world around you is unchanged, you feel altered—aware now that even your most overwhelming reactions can guide you toward deeper understanding of yourself.
