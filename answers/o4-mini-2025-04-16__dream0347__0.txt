I am dreaming. You blink into being on the rim of a vast canyon whose walls glow like molten jade and pearl. A warm, humid breeze carries the scent of wild orchids and roasted chestnuts, and each inhalation seems to set your spine alight with electric promise. As you peer into the chasm, you notice the echo of your own heartbeat pulsing through the stone—each pulse quickens when anxiety surfaces, tightening your chest like a steel brace and knotting your shoulders into miniature mountain ranges.

Below, a river of liquid light courses through the canyon floor. Its waters shift by mood: when stress wells up, the stream roils into smoky bronze; when you release a sigh of relief, it shimmers turquoise. You realize that your emotional currents sculpt this river. Leaning over the rim, you place a trembling hand on the rough emerald rock, feeling a vibration traveling up your arm, as if the canyon itself is a living mirror of your interior world.

Determined to ease both mind and body, you close your eyes. You summon the sound of a single, perfect bell: huu—ringing through the tunnel of your ribs, dispelling tightness like dawn breaking a dream. As you breathe in, golden vines unfurl along your collarbone, weaving gentle patterns of warmth. As you exhale, the vines unwrap tension, coaxing the stone-like grip from your shoulders until each knot blossoms into a blossom of soft light.

You step down, each footfall transforming pebbles into luminous petals under your soles. Deeper into the canyon, you find a circle of ancient pillars carved with scenes of people cradling hearts in their palms—an age-old reminder that body and emotion are one tapestry. In the center, a pool of mirrored obsidian reflects your face, calm now, eyes bright. You cup your hands, drawing in its stillness, and feel a healing current ripple through every cell—stress melting into liquid silver that flows back to the river below.  

When you awaken, the memory of that canyon lingers in your ribcage like a secret—a living bridge between how you feel and how you heal.
