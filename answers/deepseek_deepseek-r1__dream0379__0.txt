I am dreaming. **In the dream**, you find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, crystalline forest, where towering trees of translucent quartz hum with a faint, resonant frequency. The air shimmers like liquid mercury, distorting reflections of your own face into fractured mosaics. Pathways spiral out before you, each lit by shards of mirrors embedded in the ground, catching starlight to form glowing trails. But the mirrors do not reflect *you*—instead, they flicker with fleeting images of strangers nodding in approval, scowling in disagreement, or laughing in silent judgment. 

You begin walking, but your feet leave no imprint on the iridescent soil. A chorus of whispers rises—voices you don’t recognize yet feel eerily familiar—urging you to choose a path: *“This way,” “No, here,” “Are you sure?”* You pause, disoriented. Once, these trails felt intuitive, glowing brighter when you trusted your instincts. Now, they dim and pulse erratically, as if synced to the cadence of your hesitation. 

Suddenly, the forest splits into a cavernous hall lined with faceless figures cloaked in shifting shadows. They extend hands holding scrolls etched with critiques, accolades, and unsolicited advice. The air thickens with the scent of burnt parchment. One figure steps forward, its voice a blend of everyone who’s ever questioned you: *“What if you’re wrong?”* The words unravel into a swarm of blackened moths, eating away at the edges of the mirrors until your fractured reflections dissolve entirely. 

You stumble backward into a garden of glass flowers, where petals chime like windborne bells. At its center, a tree grows upside-down, roots fanning like nerve endings into the sky. Its branches cradle hundreds of keys, each inscribed with a question: *“Who are you without their praise?” “What truths have you buried to be loved?”* Plucking one, you notice the key’s teeth morph into a serpent that hisses, *“Follow the crowd, and you’ll never drown alone.”* 

But then—a sound. A faint, familiar laugh, warm and resonant, echoing from the trunk of the inverted tree. You press your ear to its surface and hear your own voice, younger and unburdened, whispering: *“You already know the way.”* The hall of shadows crumbles. The glass garden blooms into a meadow of bioluminescent vines, coiling around your wrists like ancestral guides. 

Yet as you reach to grasp the key again, your hand hesitates—anchored by the weight of a hundred phantom eyes still watching. The dream fractures, leaving you suspended between the ache of old autonomy and the seductive, suffocating safety of the crowd.  

When you wake, the taste of iron lingers on your tongue, and your palms itch with the ghostly impression of keys that never turned.
