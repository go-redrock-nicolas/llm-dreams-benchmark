I am dreaming.  

The world around me is a cathedral of sensation, a living mosaic of hearts beating in unison and apart. I stand in the center of a vast, sun-drenched plaza, where the air shimmers with the weight of unspoken truths. The crowd is a sea of faces—some radiant, some fractured, others hollowed by shadows only they can see. And then it happens: the veil between us dissolves. Their emotions flood into me like a thousand rivers converging, each current distinct, each wave a universe.  

A child’s laughter rings out, bright and crystalline, and suddenly I am *her*—her joy is a wildfire in my chest, golden and uncontainable, as if my ribs might shatter from the light. A street musician’s violin wails nearby, and his longing wraps around me like fog, aching and sweet, his melody a thread stitching me to memories I’ve never lived: a lover’s farewell, a homeland swallowed by distance, a hunger to be *known*.  

To my left, a man in a rumpled suit clutches a crumpled letter. His despair is a black tide, cold and suffocating, dragging me into depths where the world narrows to the tremor of his hands and the echo of a single word—*failure*. I gasp, but before I can drown, a woman brushes past me, her fury blazing like a storm. Her anger is electric, a whip of lightning that thrums in my veins, righteous and wild, screaming *I am unseen, I am unseen, I am unseen*.  

Overwhelmed, I stagger backward and collide with an elderly woman seated on a stone bench. Her grief is not sharp but ancient, a moss-covered boulder resting in her throat. It seeps into me, slow and tidal, the weight of decades—lost children, vanished seasons, love outlived. Yet beneath it hums a quiet resilience, a root system stretching deep into the earth of her bones.  

Above the cacophony, a teenager’s hope spirals upward, helium-light and stubborn, defying gravity. It smells of jasmine and ink, tastes like the first page of a book you can’t put down. His dreams are maps unfurling in my mind: deserts crossed, mountains climbed, a future where his hands are steady and his voice is heard.  

The emotions layer, collide, *merge*. I am a prism fractured by their light, a symphony played on a thousand strings. Tears stream down my face—I don’t know whose they are. A beggar’s shame, a bride’s anticipation, a soldier’s terror—they all live in me now, tangled and raw. The plaza pulses like a heartbeat, each soul a note in a song too vast to comprehend.  

And then, in the center of the storm, I find stillness. A blindfolded girl sits cross-legged, humming a lullaby. Her peace is not the absence of pain but its alchemist, transmuting chaos into something soft and enduring. When I kneel beside her, her calm flows into me like honeyed sunlight, stitching my frayed edges together.  

“You’re not just feeling them,” she whispers, her voice the hush of wind through leaves. “You’re *remembering* them. Remembering yourself.”  

I wake with the taste of a thousand lives on my tongue, my heart a cathedral still echoing with ghosts of laughter and tears. The world, I realize, has always been this loud. I was just never listening.
