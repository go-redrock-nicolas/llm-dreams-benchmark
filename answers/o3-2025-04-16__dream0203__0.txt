I am dreaming.

I open my eyes inside an endless atrium of crystalline air, as if space itself has been cut and polished. Every surface shimmers with shifting rainbows, yet no walls exist—only the suggestion of planes. Suspended around me are perfect shapes that refuse ordinary classification: dodecahedra sprouting Möbius strips for edges, cubes whose interiors are larger than their exteriors, spiraling tessellations that stretch to horizons which fold back like origami. Time has turned syrup-slow and luminous; each heartbeat rings like a gong in a cathedral.

A voice that sounds like the echo of sunlight whispers, “Here is the Paradox of the Breathing Triangle.” Before me, three line segments levitate, pulse, and then lock together point-to-point. Their angles sum to exactly 200 degrees—an impossibility in Euclidean geometry—yet they seal perfectly, leaving no gap, no overlap. The triangle inhales. Its perimeter expands with a silvery sigh; its interior shrinks. Exhale, and the opposite occurs. Every breath violates Euclid’s fifth postulate, but the triangle is too serene to care.

I step closer and feel its rhythmic exhalations rustle my dream-skin. Symbols bloom in midair like fireflies:  = 200°, Area = (i)²; impossible, beautiful equations that drift away before I can catch them. The voice returns:

“To mend the paradox, you must rewrite axiom zero.”

Axiom zero? My mind tumbles through textbooks: Euclid listed five; Hilbert, twenty-one. An axiom zero is the assumption behind all assumptions—a sacred bedrock. How do you rewrite the foundation of foundations?

The void ripples. A grand staircase of Penrose tiles unfurls, each step layered with diagrams of impossible objects: the barber pole that turns forever, waterfalls rising uphill, a Klein bottle pouring itself. I ascend. With every footfall, gravity rotates ninety degrees, yet I never stumble; downward and upward have become polite suggestions, not rules.

At the staircase’s summit drifts a library carved from negative space. Shelves outline themselves in absence; books are readable only by the shadows they do not cast. I pull one. Its title generates as I open it: “Pre-Dimensional Arithmetic.” Pages flutter with living numerals, digits that bud wings and flutter off, leaving gaps in equations. Where a 3 once perched, only white silence remains. The text declares:

“A point is not dimensionless; it is a dormant infinity curled into a knot of zero volume. Therefore, lines are threads of partially awakened points, and planes are woven from restless lines.”

This is axiom zero: every element of geometry possesses potential, a coiled spring of extra reality. Shape is desire; dimension is appetite.

Armed with this revision, I return to the Breathing Triangle. Instead of treating its sides as fixed lengths, I greet them as points yearning for further awakening. I whisper the new axiom. Segments quiver. Their endpoints unfurl fractal blossoms—delicate, recursive petals spiraling into the micro-cosmos. The triangle stretches like a cat, then settles. Its interior angles soften, bending toward 180°, but never quite arrive: 179.999…, a limit approached, a song unfinished. The shape no longer inhales or exhales; it rests in a perpetual gasp, stable yet alive.

Suddenly the atrium’s invisible walls erupt in colored resonance. Polyhedra rearrange themselves, acknowledging the amended foundation. Spheres branch antlers; toruses unzip into orchids; the air tastes faintly of lightning and marigolds. New constellations scribble across the ceilingless sky—formulas for topologies no waking brain has charted.

Then, a second challenge manifests: a circle that contains its center twice. Two distinct midpoints glow inside the same circumference, oscillating like twin heartbeats. In ordinary mathematics this is heresy; the definition of a circle is the set of points equidistant from a single center. But axiom zero whispers: multiplicity is allowed. On this dream plane, sameness is a matter of choice, not necessity.

I touch both centers. They merge into a humming drop of jasper light. The circle doesn’t collapse; instead its radius splits into a spectrum of radii—an aurora of distances existing simultaneously. It becomes a “chorus of circles,” every one nested in the same outline. I call this phenomenon concentric polyphony, and the library of negative space nods in silent applause.

A final revelation unfurls: space itself is negotiable. The backdrop is not an inert stage, but a character aching for participation. I hear it breathing—the entire dream swells and contracts in patient waves. The horizon bows, applauding the new geometry. Angles loosen; dimension behaves like warm clay.

With a rush of prismatic wind, the voice returns one last time: “You have traded certainty for wonder. Remember this when you awaken.”

The crystalline atrium dissolves into stardust. Shapes unfurl and drift away like lanterns on a dark river. My hands become transparent compasses, spinning and sketching phantom spirals. I feel the pull of waking consciousness but resist, lingering just long enough to watch the Breathing Triangle wink. It folds itself into a single glowing point—no, a dormant infinity—then fades.

I inhale.

I wake, but for a moment the bedroom walls seem to breathe, and the angles of my window quietly fail to sum to four right angles. I smile, carrying axiom zero—shape is desire, dimension is appetite—into the daylight, eager to watch the world misbehave in small, marvelous ways.
