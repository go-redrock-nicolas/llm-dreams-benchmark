I am dreaming. You close your eyes and find yourself standing on a vast, iridescent sand dune under an inexplicably lavender sky. The air is thick with the soft shimmer of moonlight, and each grain of sand appears translucent, glinting like shards of opal. A warm breeze drifts past you, scattering dunes of sparkling dust that swirl into the sky and then fade into the purple horizon.

Somewhere to your right, silver palm trees arch toward you, their fronds clinking like porcelain wind chimes. To your left is a meandering river, its waters tinted green and pale gold. The sound of gentle lapping echoes, an otherworldly hush that seems to calm your racing heart. Yet a dull ache gnaws at the back of your mind. You’re trying to remember how you got here, why you feel so exposed.

Suddenly, the sand beneath your feet resolves into shaped steps, each swirling with subtle patterns of swirling galaxies. Curiosity guiding you, you follow them upward to a towering arch carved from black marble. Engraved on the arch are words—you can faintly decipher them, something about “memories” and “spells.” The letters glint and shift as though alive.

As soon as you step through the arch, you’re transported to a cavernous space. The floor is solid glass with a dark ocean glimmering beneath it—a night sea full of luminous jellyfish drifting like living lanterns. Suspended from the ceiling are bright, oversized masks: tragic expressions, comedic grins, puzzled eyes. A single red mask floats in front of you, beckoning you closer.

It’s in that moment you recall a pang you’ve been trying to ignore. A personal sorrow. Maybe it’s an argument you had with someone dear, or the memory of a betrayal—something that tastes like rust at the back of your throat. The masks start giggling, as though they can sense the ache in your chest. You feel your stomach twist with a wave of uncomfortable sadness. To cope, you snort out a sarcastic laugh and say something flippant. Why not make a quick, inappropriate joke about it, right?

But the instant you do, the laughter of the masks warps. What was once a mocking cackle now unspools into a mournful keen—like a choir lamenting at a funeral. You find yourself wincing, your humor feeling cheap and hollow. For a split second, you see how your own laughter reflects back in the surface of the glass floor, cracked and distorted. Dread creeps up your spine.

Recognizing that your joke is a flimsy shield, you step closer to the red mask. You can sense it wants something else. Slowly, you raise your hand to your chest. You acknowledge the sadness, acknowledging that the quip you made was an attempt to push the pain away. You feel a deep warmth in your chest, as though your heart is waking up from a long sleep, fluttering and uncertain.

And as you dare to simply stand there in that mix of softness and ache, there is a shift. The mask drifts back, smiling gently before folding in on itself, disappearing in a swirl of shimmering dust. You catch your breath. The swirling galaxy under your feet moves like a tide, and you realize that by facing your hurt without disguising it, you have allowed yourself a moment of raw honesty.

The entire cavern brightens, the jellyfish beneath the glass gliding closer to the surface. Their soft glow fills the space, revealing a path lined with glimmering fragments—shells, glass beads, tiny glowing stones. Each one resonates with your heart’s newfound courage. Overhead, the comedic and tragic masks fade to a smoky haze. In their place are shimmering wisps of color shaped like blossoming flowers.

And just as you let out a steadying breath, the lavender sky from before seeps in through the cavern’s walls. The dream collapses back into the swirling dunes of opal sand and silver palm trees, but the ache in your chest feels softer, kinder—an ache laced with hope. All you have is acceptance now, laced with fragile laughter that can coexist with sorrow rather than smothering it. You smile, feeling more naked but also more free. In this drifting moment under alien constellations, you acknowledge your humor as armor and dare to set it aside. Then the dream dissolves into light. 

You awake with a renewed sense of gentle power, remembering your hurt—and how showing kindness to that hurt has already begun to heal you.
