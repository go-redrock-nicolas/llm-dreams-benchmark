I am dreaming. find myself adrift in a sprawling city woven from shimmering, translucent ribbons, each fluttering with colors no waking eye could fathom. The air hums with distant bells and the aftertaste of rain, though no clouds shadow the violet sky.  In this place where language twists and slips like quicksilver, my singular feeling—a tangled fusion of fierce yearning, aching nostalgia, and an almost electric anticipation—pulses inside me, seeking release.

I wander among peculiar inhabitants, their faces shifting in rippling mosaics, and I begin to wonder if perhaps the city itself is alive, listening. When I attempt to speak, the words rise up but transform as they pass my lips, blooming into clouds of glowing glyphs that spiral upwards, dissolving before meaning can settle. Exasperated, I press my palms together and feel music in my veins. The city responds: beneath my feet, the paving stones pulse in time with my heartbeat, while the windows high above flicker with my thoughts.

I realize I cannot shape my feeling into anything as neat as a word. Instead, I draw it into being. I reach out, fingers trailing through the luminous air, and paint my emotion—impossible colors spreading, smudging the boundaries between buildings and sky. The city bends around the new form, resonating with what can’t be said: a sensation that is both longing and discovery, absence and arrival. It is a music with no melody, a warmth that chills, a memory not quite mine. 

And as I stand in the center of that living city, the crowd gathers, hushed, breathless, for they see my floating masterpiece and recognize within it a piece of their own unspoken feelings, finally unveiled—not in words, but in the bold brilliance of dream-light.
