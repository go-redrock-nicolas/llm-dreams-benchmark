I am dreaming. …close your eyes and let the dream swallow you whole. In the hazy twilight of your subconscious, you are standing at the edge of a great forest whose ancient trees tower high into the stars. The sky overhead is an odd shade of glowing lavender, splashed with swirling teal clouds that drift like lost spirits. Each leaf in the canopy rustles with a subtle tension—as if brimming with words never spoken. You feel a pang of nostalgia in the pit of your stomach.

It hits you: you’ve grown distant from old friends. Time has gently—and sometimes not-so-gently—pushed you all into separate directions. You can barely remember the last time you laughed together until tears streamed down your cheeks. Those fuzzy memories hover in the air like golden fireflies, pulsing softly, tantalizingly close, yet just out of reach.

Turning toward the tree trunks, you notice something unusual: the labyrinth of bark on each trunk appears to be inscribed with people’s names. Some are fresh and easily read; others have faded into nearly invisible shapes, etched years prior. Tracing your fingertips against these whorled lines, you recognize the names of the friends who once felt like family. The mere brush of your skin against their carved letters seems to summon the echoes of their voices, soft as wind chimes.

Although part of you wants to linger and remember, a gentle breeze tugs at the hem of your clothing, urging you onward. You walk deeper into the forest, leaves crunching underfoot with a resonant crackle. Gnarled roots arc up from the ground, forming natural archways. Every twisted root you pass beneath brings a swirl of recollections: first from a time of silly jokes and movie nights, then from that day you said goodbye to one friend who moved across the country, and finally from forgotten birthdays and unanswered texts.

A hollow ache wraps around your heart as you sense yourself drifting from these once-treasured friends. In the dream, your sadness manifests as glowing tears that streak down your cheeks but evaporate into violet sparks the moment they hit the ground. Those sparks glow and spiral upward, gathering like tiny lanterns into the trees before bursting into showers of starlight. You watch in awe—somehow comforted, even in the midst of loss.

Up ahead, a grand clearing reveals itself, illuminated by moonlight so luminous it almost feels alive. In the middle stands a massive oak with branches that spread wide like the arms of a guardian. Suspended among its mighty branches are silken, shimmering hammocks. Each one is tethered with broad ribbons of light—amber, magenta, cerulean—representing connections you once forged with the people you cared about.

You step closer, brushing your hand along those ribbons. They quiver at your touch, trembling like the strings of a harp. You sense a pull within yourself, a yearning to stoke those old bonds. But you also sense the weight of your new responsibilities. Life has changed, and so have you. Strangely, you do not feel guilt—only a wave of tender wistfulness. The oak’s trunk has been carved with a single symbol: a compass rose, pointing off in every direction. As you run your fingertips around its edges, you recognize it as the symbol of your changing paths.

The ribbons pulse, sending pulses of light coursing through the forest canopy. The distant hush of a breeze turns into whispered encouragement, urging you to let go of any shame or regret. You realize that what truly matters is appreciation for how friendship shaped you. Perhaps some connections have frayed with time, but those old friends remain part of your own personal story.

Drawing a long, steady breath, you decide to let the ribbons stretch. Some remain bound strong and bright, those are the kindred souls you still keep in your life—even if from afar. Others begin to fade slightly, dissolving into delicate wisps, dwindling into the night sky. Watching those intangible ribbons fade away reminds you that every relationship evolves. The ones not meant to stay will quietly, gently, drift off.

With that final acceptance settling in your heart, the dream landscape begins to shift. The colossal oak’s branches sway, shudder, and transform into a grand archway made of woven vines and glimmering leaves. An invitation to step forward into the next chapter. Soft motes of light swirl around you—somehow reminiscent of the old friends with whom you share fewer words these days.

You watch, resolute, as the archway forms a door of bleached wood. Sensing that you must enter, you press a hand against it, knocking ever so softly. The door swings open smoothly, and without looking back, you walk through. On the other side, you glimpse a panoramic horizon of rolling hills, golden lights flickering—new possibilities and encounters waiting for you. 

And in that moment, a pang of gratitude suffuses your chest—gratitude for the dear friendships that once flourished, for the ways they molded you, and for the quiet truth that not all precious things remain in your orbit forever. Your last tears fall, each droplet bursting into stardust that dances around your shoulders. You feel simultaneously lighter and more whole, brimming with the gentle acceptance that accompanies a heart at peace.

In this bittersweet radiance, the dream fades. Yet the memory of that forest, the glowing ribbons, and the warmth of old friendships remain, guiding you forward with a renewed sense of calm and possibility.
