I am dreaming. I find myself in a vast, crystal-clear canyon that seems to stretch endlessly under a twilight sky. The air hums with a faint, turquoise glow. I take a step forward, and my boot sinks slightly into something powdery and cold—snow, but not ordinary snow. Each grain sparkles like crushed gemstones, and as I lift my leg, the imprints my foot left begin to swirl with tiny, glowing patterns, almost like constellations. 

The weightlessness of the air is disorienting; it feels as though I could float if I leaped. But my attention is drawn upward, to the jagged peaks towering above. The rocks there aren’t gray but deep indigo, almost black, with veins of molten silver streaking through them like rivers of flowing stars. 

A low rumble shakes the ground beneath me. The mountainside to my left begins to tremble, and fissures—long, jagged cracks—slice open in the snow ahead. They widen, dark and glistening, and with them comes a gust of wind that carries an odor I can’t identify: something metallic yet sweet, like burnt sugar mixed with ozone. 

Somewhere behind me, I hear a faint, resonant chime, as though a great bronze bell has been struck miles away. The snow between the fissures starts to shift, grain by grain, rising into the air as if pulled by an invisible magnet. It forms into shapes—first wispy tendrils, then faceless humanoid figures with translucent, shimmering skin. Their forms flicker, appearing and disappearing as they move toward me. 

One reaches out a hand, made of swirling snow and stardust. Before it touches me, its form fractures into a thousand tiny, glowing particles that swirl around my head. A voice, not unlike my own but deeper, older, echoes inside my skull: *“The bridge is fracturing. You have but one true step before the snow claims its debt.”*

I try to run, but my boots sink deeper into the ground, the snow now a thick, sticky mire. The fissures multiply, spreading across the slope like the cracking of ancient porcelain. The figures close in, their movements jerky and unnatural, as if struggling against some unseen force. 

Above me, the sky darkens further, and a single, colossal snowflake begins to fall, its crystal arms branching into a lattice so intricate it obscures the stars behind it. As it descends, the entire landscape tilts—not sideways, but vertically. I’m sliding now, arms flailing, along the face of what I now realize is a living, breathing wall of ice and stone. 

The cold bites harder, and I catch glimpse of eyes within the ice—deep, ancient eyes that watch from behind cascading waterfalls of frozen time. My teeth chatter uncontrollably, and my breath comes in ragged, white plumes. A path of light opens before me—golden and humming, a stairway woven into the side of the cliff. 

The snow figures are almost upon me. I leap toward the light, and for a moment, I’m weightless, soaring through the eerie turquoise glow. My fingers brush the edge of the first step, and it solidifies beneath me, warm and resonant. Behind me, the fissures collapse in on themselves with a sound like glass shattering underwater. 

The stairway spirals upward, each step glowing brighter as I ascend. At the top awaits a door arched with ice crystals, its handle forged from a single, enormous sapphire. When I touch it, the world dissolves into a symphony of light and sound—a finale of whirling colors and echoing laughter. I wake, heart pounding, the taste of frost lingering on my lips.
