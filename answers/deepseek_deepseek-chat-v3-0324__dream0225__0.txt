I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a vast, iridescent pool—not of water, but of liquid starlight. The surface shimmers with constellations that ripple when I touch them, sending waves of silver and gold across an endless midnight expanse. Around me, the air hums with the whispers of unseen beings, their voices threading together in a melody that tugs at something deep inside my chest.  

I am barefoot, and the ground beneath me is not earth but something softer, a substance that molds to my feet like warm sand yet leaves no imprint. Above, the sky is a canvas of swirling nebulas, bleeding rich violets and deep ceruleans, pulsating to the rhythm of my heartbeat.  

Then, the challenge arrives—not as words, not as instructions, but as an inescapable *knowing.* I must weave a song from silence, craft light from shadow, and bend the laws of this dream-world in ways I have never attempted. The other candidates stand on distant, floating islands, already shaping worlds with effortless gestures—conjuring bridges of glass, sculpting mountains that hum in harmony. Their talents are innate, instinctive. I have none of that.  

Yet, as I stretch out my hands, something unexpected happens.  

The starlight *answers.*  

It coils around my fingers like silk, shaping itself into fragile, glowing strands. I tug gently, hesitantly—and the night itself unravels, revealing hidden patterns, secret geometries I never noticed before. The whispers grow louder, guiding me, not with instruction but with *possibility.*  

I realize then—this dream does not require mastery.  

It requires wonder.  

And so, I begin to dance, to weave, to play. The ground beneath me shudders. The sky leans in.  

And the dream begins anew.
