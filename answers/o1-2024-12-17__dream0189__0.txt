I am dreaming. You drift among colorless clouds that roll in like tattered veils across a darkening sky. The air feels electric, alive, as if sentient with your every emotion. You’re in a place that aches with half-remembered echoes, the outline of an ancient temple or cathedral rising from the mist. The faint hush of wind, swelling then falling, sounds like your own heartbeat reverberating outside your body.

Inside this dreamscape, you sense a presence—familiar, yet unreal. Edges of the temple’s archways are veiled with fluttering ribbons of twilight shade. In the distance, a faint chanting hum resonates in your ears. The dream beckons you forward.

When you enter the main courtyard, each step grows heavier, as though the floor beneath transforms into something molten, each tile pressing into you with urgent significance. You stand before a grand mirror in the center, its twisted gold frame shaped like reaching vines. Your reflection hovers upon the glass like a phantom: same eyes, same face, yet somehow it seems to gaze back with a knowledge you dare not admit.

Suddenly, the figure in the mirror leans forward. With a voice that echoes from everywhere at once, it reveals a painful truth about you—a hidden flaw, a regret, something you’ve buried deep within yourself to preserve your delicate self-image. The words strike like metal on flint, filling the air with sparks that illuminate those corners of your mind you’d rather keep in darkness.

Instantly, your thoughts ignite into a flurry of justifications. The mirror’s voice rattles truths that you scramble to deny: reasons, explanations, half-lies. Your pulse pounds. Your throat feels tight. Yet as you watch, you realize you are witnessing your own mind mobilizing its defenses. The swirl of denial, that reflexive attempt to protect yourself, becomes visible—like translucent tendrils of smoke uncoiling from your chest. The swirl rushes to wrap itself around the words, trying to obscure them, shrouding them in feeble comfort.

And you observe it.

Time seems to suspend, thick and honey-like, as you hover between this reflex to shield and an emerging desire to see more clearly. You watch these defense mechanisms in motion, painting alternate narratives about who you are, ignoring or minimizing the painful truth. Yet something within you remains curious. Instead of letting yourself sink into the usual deflections, you hold steady—poised on the brink of discovery.

In your stillness, the smoke disentangles, the swirling denial slowing. You begin to sense both the brunt of the truth and the compassion you yearn for. A gentle luminescence wells up behind you, as though the temple itself recognizes your moment of clarity. You press your palm against the mirror’s surface, meeting those eyes that belonged to your reflection. There is grief—yes—but also relief. Honesty stands on the threshold of freedom.

You allow yourself a breath. The mirror cracks just slightly, slender fractures fanning out like the petals of a metallic flower. The ribbons above flutter more wildly, and the chanting drifts away, dissolving into a hush. The hush is filled with your own resolve. Denial falters in the face of this willingness to see. A tear traces down your cheek, a single droplet of acceptance.

As the courtyard’s walls begin to dissolve and every surface brightens in a soft glow, you hear the distant echo of your own truthful voice murmuring words of growth. The broken mirror lingers as a memory, a symbol of your old defenses shining with the first rays of dawn. Now they do not control you. You feel lighter, as if you’ve released something heavy you’ve carried for ages.

Above, the sky blushes with a gentle sunrise, pastel pinks and golds swirling in that surreal, dreamlike fashion. The temple stones fade, the ground dissolves beneath your feet, and you float, quietly. A soft acceptance weaves itself into your core. As you awaken, or perhaps remain in that fragile boundary of sleep, you hold onto the understanding that it is only by confronting the very truths you wish to hide that you can become whole.
