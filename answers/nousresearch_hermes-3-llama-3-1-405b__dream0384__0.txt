I am dreaming. In my dream, the air is thick with anticipation – as if the whole world is grinding through some massive, slow-motion turn.  I feel it viscerally, unmistakably.  

In this dreamscape, I am conscious – lucid – and I have a mission: seek out the places where I have avoided growth, confront them, and bloom.  It won't be easy or comfortable, but that's precisely the point.  It's time to challenge my comfort-seeking tendencies.  

Then it happens – a scene straight out of my deepest, most tender depths.  I am in a tiny room, barely larger than a closet and illuminated by a single, bare-bulb light.  The walls are a neutral shade of non-committal beige.  The floor is cold beneath my feet.  There's a small wooden chair in the center of the room – and inexplicably, I am sitting on it, staring at a door on the opposite wall.  

Some part of me understands that this door represents the threshold between my comfort zone and the growth I've been avoiding.  The door is wooden and old – “ancient” is the word that comes to mind – with a heavy wrought-iron handle.  As I gaze at the door, I notice intricate carvings all along its surface – eddies and whorls that create patterns and — is that writing?  I squint and draw closer, my heart pounding more frantically with each tentative step.  

As I approach the door, I realize that the writings seem familiar.  It looks like some form of cursive, with repeated, overlapping patterns that resemble the Greek letter Delta.  "Change," I think to myself.  "This door is all about change."  

Now, I am mere inches from the door, hesitant, wavering – it is now or never.  There is a part of me that wants to turn back, to retreat to the safe, the known, the comfortable.  But that's not why I'm here.  I'm here to break with routine and challenge the part of me that seeks the easy path.  

I take one deep breath, then another.  Then, throwing caution to the wind, I reach out and grab hold of the door's handle, giving it a firm but steady pull.  The door groans and creaks, then cracks open, exhaling a blast of air that swirls around me, both warm and cool at the same time.  I'm momentarily dazzled as the room fills with prismatic colors: brilliant reds, mythical purples, azure blues.  In the end, it all coalesces into a singular phrase that leaves me breathless:

"Your potential."

With a final glance back at the room that held me for so long, I step forward across the threshold, allowing myself to become engulfed in a symphony of sensations.  My transformation has only just begun, but I know that this is it – this is me, embracing the discomfort and chasing growth.  

And so it is that the dream takes on an ever-shifting, technicolor sheen, perceptions merging and shapeshifting beyond the limits of my understanding.  

Throughout it all – an almost musical chorus that seems to echo through to my very bones: "You are becoming."  And indeed, I am.
