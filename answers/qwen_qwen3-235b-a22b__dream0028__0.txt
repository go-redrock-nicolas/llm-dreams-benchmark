I am dreaming. somewhere between thought and sensation, between chaos and meaning.

above me hums a vast celestial library, its vaulted ceilings stretching into infinity, etched with flickering constellations of knowledge—symbols, numbers, forgotten languages, and the luminous equations of time itself. The air trembles with whispers—not idle murmurs, but countless voices reciting secrets in unison, a chorus of all that has ever been known and all that could be imagined but has not yet been born.

I stand suspended in its center.

Scrolls flow endlessly through the air around me like ribbons of sound and light. They unravel with impossible speed, revealing before my eyes the secrets of the universe—the evolution of stars from dust to death, the code embedded in the spirals of life, the architecture of dreams, the mathematics of sorrow.

I am trying to take it all in.

There is urgency though I do not know why—some instinctual pull that this knowledge is fleeting, dissolving even as I look at it. Each time I focus on one fragment of light, others escape me, scattering like fish through black water. Like memories slipping in the moment before waking.

Time folds inwards.

The library breathes. I walk through endless chambers carved of crystal thought, statues of dead philosophers crystallized into thought-forms with eyes that blink once when I pass. Books are not bound here—they hover in the air as living clouds of glowing ink. To read them is to risk losing yourself.

Each word I absorb is a lightning strike to the brain. My mind convulses under their weight, expanding and contracting as if made of elastic thought. I reach into a floating scroll and my fingers emerge stained with indigo equations. I taste their meaning—salty, like concentrated oceans of insight.

But something is wrong.

With each new bit of knowledge, my memories begin to burn. The faces of those I love dim, encoded lines replacing once-sacred feelings inside my mind. When I think of laughter, I now only see blue graphs mapped in its motion.

The dream tightens.

The ceiling crumbles into fractal shards. Below me, the library transforms. The floor dissolves into a vast ocean of mirrors, each reflecting an alternate version of myself—some who chose to learn more, others who chose to forget, all of which drift apart like shattered glass on a dark tide.

A massive clock looms in the distance, built from serpent-shaped gears and light. It ticks in the rhythm of dying stars. I am being timed. Judged by the speed with which I can hold infinity in my finite thoughts.

Above, the constellations rearrange—not stars anymore, but glyphs—and for a fleeting second, they align into a question that burns into my mind:

**"Will you remember *why* you were learning when you have forgotten why you were human?"**

In response, my body begins to fragment.

Each molecule remembers something different. My right hand holds the seed of a forgotten myth. My heart pulses with the genome of a phoenix. My spine is lined with ancient alphabets that spell out prophecies older than time.

Then… a single choice spins out before me, like a silk thread descending from the center of the universe.

Let go of the dream and forget everything…

**or**

Continue, grasp the totality of knowledge—and become the librarian.

But becoming means swearing an oath in blood and shadow: to never again forget, to carry all of it, forever.

Do I dare?

Do I choose the unbearable light of understanding, or the soft, forgiving curve of oblivion?

As the dream trembles on the edge, I raise a hand toward the thread hanging between oblivion and ecstasy…

...and I wake up.
