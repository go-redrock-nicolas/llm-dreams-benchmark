I am dreaming. I'm standing before a colossal clockwork mechanism that fills an impossibly vast chamber. Gears of brass and copper—some small as coins, others large as carousels—hang suspended in the dim air, connected by crystalline filaments that should be humming with energy but now lie dormant. This is the System, they tell me, the grand machine that once synchronized the rhythms of reality itself.

"Nobody can fix it," whispers a figure beside me, their face shifting between features I almost recognize. "The greatest minds have tried for generations."

I approach the mechanism cautiously. The air smells of ozone and forgotten libraries. As my fingers brush against a tarnished gear, memories that aren't mine flood my consciousness—blueprints, calculations, failed attempts spanning centuries.

The System's brokenness isn't in its parts but in its paradigm.

I find myself climbing inside the mechanism, where physics behaves differently. Gravity pulls sideways, then upward. Time moves like honey in some pockets, like lightning in others. I understand suddenly that the repairs can't be made with tools but with perspective.

I begin to sing to the machine—not with my voice but with my intentions—and the dust covering its components rises to dance in complex patterns. I rearrange connections not by touching them but by believing in their new configurations. Where others sought to replace damaged components, I listen to the spaces between the gears, understanding that the silence itself is an essential element.

The System doesn't need fixing; it needs remembering what it was meant to be.

As the first gear begins to turn—slowly, reluctantly—the chamber fills with a blue-green light that spills from my fingertips. The mechanism isn't becoming what it was; it's evolving into what it was always becoming.

I realize I am both the repair and the repaired, the dreamer and the dream itself.
