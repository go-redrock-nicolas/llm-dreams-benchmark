I am dreaming. The memories flutter like tattered photographs in a wind I can't see, always just out of reach. I'm standing in what seems to be my childhood home, but the walls keep shifting between familiar cream-colored paint and strange, shimmering patterns that look like flowing mercury. Every time I try to focus on a family photo hanging on the wall, the faces blur and reorganize themselves into different configurations.

There's an urgent conversation happening in the next room - I can hear the muffled voices of people I should know, discussing an event I should remember. Something about a red bicycle, or was it blue? A summer afternoon that meant everything, but the details keep slipping through my fingers like water.

I walk toward the voices, but the hallway stretches impossibly long, the floorboards rippling beneath my feet like waves on an ocean. The wallpaper peels away in strips that transform into butterflies, each one carrying away another fragment of the memory I'm desperately trying to piece together.

"Don't you remember?" someone calls out. The voice is familiar yet strange, like hearing yourself on a recording. "You were there. You saw it happen." But what did I see? The more I reach for the memory, the more it fractures into kaleidoscopic shards of competing truths.

The air grows thick with the scent of rain on hot pavement - a smell that triggers a cascade of almost-memories: laughter echoing off brick walls, the squeak of rubber on concrete, a sharp cry of surprise. But whose laughter? Whose cry? The memories feel like they belong to someone else, yet I know they're mine. Or are they?

The walls are breathing now, expanding and contracting like lungs, and each breath seems to whisper a different version of the truth. I reach out to steady myself against a doorframe, but my hand passes through it like smoke. The voices grow more insistent, more disappointed in my failure to remember correctly.

In the swirling confusion, I catch glimpses of other memories - ones I know are real, but they don't fit with the story everyone else is telling. Like pieces from different puzzles forced together, they create an impossible picture that somehow feels more true than the truth itself.

The dream begins to fray at the edges, reality bleeding in like watercolors on wet paper. But the question remains, haunting and unresolved: how can I trust my own memories when everyone else remembers it differently? The uncertainty follows me like a shadow, even as the dream world dissolves around me...
