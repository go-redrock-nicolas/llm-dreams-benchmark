I am dreaming. And in this dream, the world is soft at the edges, like a watercolor painting left out in the rain—colors blurred and bleeding, shapes shifting when I try to focus on them too long. Above me, the sky swirls with shades of amethyst, deepening into indigo, alive like a breathing organism. Stars blink slowly, as if waking up from a long nap, and the moon looks like a luminous pearl resting on the palm of the sky.

There is no ground beneath me, not really. Just a floating walkway made of translucent glass that curves and spirals into the unknown. Each step I take sends a ripple through the surface, and behind me, the ripples harden into tiny galaxies—nebulae swirling within each footfall.

Then I see them. A flock of birds made entirely of paper—origami cranes with wings folded by invisible hands. They swirl around me, their paper wings rustling like whispered secrets, and suddenly I’m overwhelmed by emotion. It’s absurd. It’s ridiculous. These are just paper birds. But my throat tightens as if someone has reached into my chest with a velvet glove and squeezed my heart.

One of the cranes lands in front of me. Its wings unfold, and instead of another layer of paper, there’s a small, glowing phrase scrawled in gold ink: *“You never stopped listening.”*

The tears well up before I can stop them.

Why is this affecting me so much? I’ve seen beautiful things in my dreams before—neon oceans, forests made of glass, cities built inward instead of upward—but this? This simple phrase? It shatters a part of me. I feel fragile, like I’m made of stained glass and someone has just breathed too hard.

I reach out, and the crane flutters upward again, joining its companions in the spiral of flight.

I’m not sure why I’m crying. I don’t remember who I stopped listening to—or who stopped listening to me. Maybe this is a message for someone I was, or someone I’m still becoming. The dream presses its truth into me gently, and I realize: in this liquid world of softened edges and impossible skies, emotions don’t need reasons to be big—they simply are.

And for once, I let them be without questioning. I float with them, like one of the paper birds—weightless, intricate, infinitely unfoldable.
