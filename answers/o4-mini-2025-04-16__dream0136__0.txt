I am dreaming. I’m drifting in the soft hush before dawn when suddenly I’m backstage at the Celestial Opera House—a grand, impossibly tall hall of polished moonstone and glowing crystal chandeliers that float like jellyfish in the dark. The air is heavy with the scent of night-blooming jasmine and dusted stardust. Velvet curtains the color of midnight ripple in a breeze I can’t feel. A hush falls as the stage manager’s panicked whisper reaches me: “The Prima Star has fallen ill. You’re on. Now.”

My heart pounds like a tribal drum. I’ve never sung on any stage, let alone in front of thousands of expectant faces that glimmer in the dim, like a field of fireflies. My costume—a gown woven from silver spider-silk and fragments of dawn—clings to me, unfamiliar and weightless. They usher me forward, and each step echoes in a corridor of mirrored pillars that stretch infinitely upward. Every reflection shows a different version of me: brave, terrified, triumphant, trembling. The final mirror cracks with a silent shiver, and I step through it.

The curtain parts to reveal an audience seated beneath a sky of shifting constellations. Stars pulse to an otherworldly rhythm, and the orchestra, made up of ghostly figures playing instruments carved from fallen meteorites, begins a low, humbling trill. My breath catches. Then, without warning, a wave of heat like sunrise surges through me. I open my mouth, and instead of a shaky whimper, a clear, soaring note spills out—vibrant as liquid light. It ripples through the hall, waking hidden chimera perched in the balconies, stirring them to dance in slow, graceful arcs.

I close my eyes and let the melody guide me. Each phrase I sing paints the theater in new colors: ribbons of sapphire swirl into gold, silver fractals dance across the ceiling, and petals of starlight drift down around me. The audience leans forward, enraptured, as if I’m weaving them into a collective dream. My voice climbs higher, holding a chord so pure it feels like the first drop of dew on a leaf at dawn. The meteorite instruments respond, adding thunderous undertones that make the floor tremble beneath my bare feet.

When I finally release that last, shimmering note, the whole Opera House seems to inhale. Then a single clap—soft at first—ripples into an avalanche of cheers. The constellations overhead explode into fireworks of spectral color. The ghostly musicians vanish, leaving only echoes in the marble halls. As the curtain falls, I find myself alone on the empty stage, breathless, heart still racing with that otherworldly music. The roar of applause fades into the dusk of my dream, and I wake with the taste of stardust on my lips and the memory of a voice that wasn't entirely mine.
