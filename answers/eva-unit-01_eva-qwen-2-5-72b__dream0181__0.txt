I am dreaming. In this world of perceptual wonder, I suddenly find myself transported into a realm of overwhelming authority, standing atop an organization that never seemed within reach. Appointed as Supreme Arbiter of the Obsidian Order, I am entrusted with influences that sculpt unseen destinies across vast reaches of time and space.

The domed council chamber's ethereal blue glow illuminates the aghast expressions of my subordinates. They are men and women of formidable intellect, veteran statesmen entangled in a web of complex machinations. Yet here stands an unlikely leader, freshly appointed by some unknown force.

Contemptuous whispers echo from their furrowed brows, their disbelieving eyes. They mutter ancient codes and cite unyielding precedent, seeing me as a child pretending at a game of warlords and sculptors. Some sneer openly, not caring whether their disdain reaches my ears. I can easily discern the tumultuous thoughts swirling beneath their polished facades.

My heart races, seizing upon subtle nuances of their speech, flinching at their fresh waves of resentment. At their center, Lord Cassius' embittered snarl declares, "You forget your boundaries, Arbiter. You have no place among us. Nothing ensures your longevity here."

A hush falls over the assembly. 

Strides across the chamber feel like light-years; every movement is deliberate — scrutinized. I can almost see the deliberations behind their cold, appraising gazes. They have seen countless pretenders fall before me. What gives me the assurance to stand among them, lacking their centuries of experience and legacy?

And yet, I feel a resolve deeper than anything before. Here, at this juncture, a phantom wisdom guides my hand, crafting a singular vision neither derived from history nor taught by tradition. In this dream, even doubt itself must bend to my will.

I speak, and my words echo through the chamber, holding a command that silences all dissent. "You are wrong, Lord Cassius," I declare.

"We stand at a precipice unlike any other. The years that shaped your certainties have given way to a crucible of uncertainty. Here, unconventional ideas are the path to salvation, not tradition binding us to our slow demise."

For a moment, their faces reveal uncertainty as they weigh my words. I continue.

"My authority does not arise from the archives of the past. It springs forth from the reality that stands before us now. The Obsidian Order needs new eyes to discern our future—a future you have trained yours' to disregard."

A profound silence hangs in the air—no whispers, no murmurs. They wait for the next words to fall from my 'unworthy' lips, for I have become a living paradox none dare dismiss. And as the dream unfolds, I know this strange turn of fate has already begun reshaping the boundaries of their beliefs.

Thus begins the tale of the unlikeliest leader to ever grace the Obsidian Order.
