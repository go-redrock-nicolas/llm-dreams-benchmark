I am dreaming. As I hold the gleaming scalpel in my trembling hand, the harsh fluorescent lights of the operating room cast an otherworldly glow across the patient's exposed skull. The steady beep of monitors creates an ominous rhythm that matches my racing heartbeat. Despite having no medical training, I somehow understand that this person's life hangs by a thread that I must carefully unravel.

The surgical team around me wears faces that keep shifting and morphing, sometimes appearing as people I know, other times as abstract collections of features that don't quite make sense. Their surgical masks ripple like water when they move. The tools on the sterile tray beside me seem to hover slightly above the surface, casting impossible shadows that dance across the walls.

As I lower the scalpel toward the patient's head, I notice their hair has transformed into delicate strands of flowing copper wire that pulse with tiny electrical currents. The skull beneath begins to become transparent, revealing a brain that glows with swirling colors - deep purples, electric blues, and shimmering gold. I can see thoughts moving through it like schools of luminescent fish.

My hands suddenly feel both incredibly steady and completely disconnected from my body. The scalpel blade catches the light and splits it into a rainbow that spreads across the ceiling. As I prepare to make the first incision, the patient opens their eyes - they're my eyes, staring back at me - and the floor beneath my feet begins to slowly tilt...

The room starts to fold in on itself like a piece of origami, while the medical instruments float upward, defying gravity. I remain anchored to the spot, watching as reality bends around me, knowing that I must complete this impossible surgery even as the laws of physics crumble...
