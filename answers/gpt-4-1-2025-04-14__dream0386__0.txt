I am dreaming. —in this shadow-woven dreamscape, the world around me pulses with a surreal, intoxicating boldness. I glide through streets loud with color and impossible geometry, the buildings bending at inconceivable angles to beckon me forward. Social boundaries appear as towering glass walls—fragile, glittering, and wholly ignorable.

Whenever I encounter these shimmering barriers that stand between me and some irresistible pleasure—be it a kaleidoscopic feast on the other side of a locked door or a forbidden gallery of living, shifting paintings—I feel only a flicker of mischief, as if the rules themselves are daring me to break them. I walk straight through the trembling boundaries, glass splintering soundlessly, leaving only ripples in the dream air. No one stops me; the crowds on the other side, their faces morphing between fascination and envy, watch as I seize whatever calls to me—delicate, impossible fruit; the silverest, most resonant violin; secrets whispered behind the velvet curtains.

Here, rights and rules dissolve like sugar in warm tea. I am guided not by conscience or caution, but by the magnetic pull of immediate desire. I taste, I touch, I take—guided by the lush, intoxicating urgency of want. In this dream kingdom unbound by consequence or guilt, my path is always open, the treasures endless, and the resistance paper-thin.

And yet, beneath the brilliance and freedom, a distant tremor hums—a recognition that wakes with me at dawn, lingering in the memory of golden chaos, daring me to wonder what lines, if any, should ever really hold.
