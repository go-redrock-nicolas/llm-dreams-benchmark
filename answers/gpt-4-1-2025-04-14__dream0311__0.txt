I am dreaming.

The world around me wavers at the edges, painted by the ghostly palettes of twilight. The air is abuzz with the hum of voices—raw, tense, cacophonous. I stand at the heart of a small town square—a patchwork of crumbling brickwork and proud murals, each wall telling an old story, some beautiful, others marred with scars of prejudice. People cluster in wary groups, their eyes flickering with suspicion, defiance, and fear—genuine, bone-deep fear of change.

I am here to advocate for justice, for voices silenced by the weight of tradition, for the overlooked pulse beneath the town’s surface. The wind tugs at my coat, urging me forward. In my hands, I hold a sheaf of papers—names, stories, cries for fairness—and a battered megaphone, chipped from years of use.

When I step onto the makeshift stage—a stack of faded crates—my heartbeat is a defiant drum within my chest. The opposition gathers like a storm: elders perched on folding chairs, younger leaders with arms crossed and jaws clenched, even friends suddenly made unfamiliar by their unease.

My words flow, trembling at first, then gaining strength as I speak not only of justice, but of hope. I paint pictures for them: the child longing to be accepted, the shopkeeper denied a decent wage, the song that could rise from many voices if only the walls came down. I tell stories—all vivid, real, bleeding with humanity—that slip through the cracks in their armor.

Murmurs ripple through the crowd—resistance incarnate, bitter as cold iron—but I meet their eyes, one pair at a time. I invite them to share their fears, their hopes, their losses. I listen, really listen, and the dream shifts—stone-hard faces cracking, eyes shining wet in the streetlamps’ uncertain glow.

Someone—a grizzled man with calloused hands—steps forward. He begins with anger, but spills into heartbreak, speaking of losses and old wounds. Others follow, their own burdens tumbling out. The square begins to pulse with a tentative, shared vulnerability. Walls, so slowly, begin to crumble.

In the dream’s deepest dark, we do not agree—not yet—but we have spoken, truly spoken, and the air smells just a little bit sweeter than it did before. Above, the dawn’s first light warms the horizon, painting hope in fragile gold across battered brick and watchful eyes.

This is the beginning—the stubborn spark of change—and in the surreal, endless hush of dreaming, I know it is enough.
