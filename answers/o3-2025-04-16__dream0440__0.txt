I am dreaming. …I am dreaming, and the dream opens like a great, breathing book.

Page One: I stand in a boundless twilight meadow where every blade of grass is tipped with ink. When I kneel, the grass writes across my palms— tiny cursive lines that form questions: “Who taught you your worth? Who measured your hunger?” A hush falls, warm and fragrant as honeyed milk, and I remember being five years old, clutching a crayon drawing to my chest, waiting for praise that never arrived. The meadow ripples—each ripple a skipped heartbeat—then it lifts me like wind-borne paper toward the next scene.

Page Two: Floating corridors of childhood memories spiral upward, stitched together with ribbons of dim light. Doors appear, fashioned from old report cards, parental sighs, overheard arguments about money. Each door bears a bronze placard reading a rule I once inhaled as truth:

• “Love is earned only through achievement.”  
• “Joy must be justified.”  
• “Silence keeps you safe.”

I reach for the first placard. It dissolves into fireflies the moment my fingers touch it, their lantern-bodies humming, “Unwritten, unwritten, unwritten.” I exhale, and the hallway rearranges itself into a vast observatory.

Page Three: The observatory’s ceiling is a dome of living constellations—constellations shaped like report cards, empty cookie jars, locked bedroom doors. A telescope carved from bone and stardust stands in the room’s center. I peer through it and see not distant galaxies, but parallel versions of myself—each existing under a different belief. One stumbles along a gray stairwell, forever climbing; another sits on a sun-warmed dock, legs dangling in water that glows with bioluminescent laughter.

I choose the dock version and focus the telescope. Down the barrel of the lens I whisper, “Teach me your knowing.” The dock-self lifts her face. She places a glowing shell to her ear and sends back a single note—pure, silver, resonant. It shatters the dome. Black shards rain down but turn to feathers before they land.

Page Four: Now I’m in a library beneath an ocean. Shelves of coral arches hold scripts of inherited narratives. Books whisper as they breathe water, pages fluttering like sea-anemone tendrils. A younger me—eight, maybe nine—waits at a writing desk, cheeks smudged blue by ink. She slides a parchment toward me. At the top is the old proclamation: “I deserve only what remains after others are full.”

I take a pearl-handled knife and cut the sentence free from the parchment. It wriggles like a severed eel before dissolving into sea-foam. I hand my younger self a quill. She writes a new sentence in shimmering octopus ink: “I deserve an ocean’s share, because my being is tide and moon alike.” A conch shell seals the ink with a gentle breath.

Page Five: The ocean-library tilts, becoming a ballroom carved into the heartwood of a redwood tree. Music swirls—a symphony of heartbeat drums, ancestral lullabies, and the sound of soil dreaming of seeds. Guests arrive: every earlier version of me. They wear garments woven from old limiting beliefs, but the cloth frays with each dance step. As we twirl, the garments unravel, thread by thread, until we spin barefoot in shafts of sunrise, clothed only in possibility.

In the center of the ballroom sprouts a sapling made of mirrored glass. On each leaf is etched a new rule we’re ready to live:

• “Receiving is a birthright; giving is a choice.”  
• “Joy is not borrowed— it is generated.”  
• “My silence is valuable only when it is chosen, not forced.”

We water the sapling with laughter borne from our bellies. It grows into a fully fledged tree, branches bending under fruit of shining lacunae—empty spaces that invite whatever nourishment I need next.

Page Six: Dawn breaks. The tree’s fruit bursts into prisms, refracting light into a staircase that spirals upward through the redwood’s canopy. I ascend. Each step pulses: “you, you, you, you”—a drumbeat of belonging. At the top I emerge onto a dawn-kissed cliff above the waking world. Far below, ocean waves applaud with white foamy hands.

A parchment unfurls across the sky— blank, luminous, limitless. I raise my newly emptied palm, thumb stained with octopus ink, and begin to write:

“I am deserving of sunlight even on days of rain.  
I am deserving of rest in the midst of storms.  
I am deserving of my own unbroken gaze.”

The words glow until they blend with morning light, indistinguishable from the sun itself.

And just before waking, I feel the meadow, the hallway, the observatory, the ocean-library, and the redwood ballroom all fold inside my chest like a traveling lantern. They do not disappear; they become my pulse.

I am dreaming. I am rewriting. I awaken—carrying every luminous syllable back into the bright, tangible day.
