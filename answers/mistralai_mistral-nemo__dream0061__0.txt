I am dreaming. In the grand amphitheater of the imagination, I find myself standing at the edge of a stage illuminated by an ethereal, soft glow that seems to emanate from the very heart of the room. The scene is bathed in a symphony of hues, like a canvas painted by an artist inspired by the cosmos - deep blues and purples swirling with stardust and wisps of nebulae, a celestial ballet dancing around the presentation hall.

The air is filled with an electric charge, a tangible hum of anticipation that seems to reverberate through the very atoms of my being. The panels of renowned experts are not mere mortals, but avatars of the most profound minds history has ever known - Einstein, Curie, Turing, and more, their eyes glowing with curiosity and intellect behind glasses that gleam like constellations in the night sky.

My heart pounds like a drumline in my chest, a rhythm echoing the pulsating energy of the cosmos. I look down at my notes, bound in a leather folder that's worn smooth from years of dedicated toil. But as my eyes scan the pages, my heart sinks like a stone in tranquility. Error upon error, like a plague of locusts, ravage the documents - dates swapped, formulas miscalculated, theories contradicted. The dreams I've been nurturing for a lifetime,/clinging to like a cloak against the world's chill, lie in tatters at my feet.

The panic that grips me is like a raging storm, thunder roaring in my ears, lightning forking through my veins. I'm drowning in a tempest of my own making, the weight of my failure an anchor pulling me under. I try to speak, to explain, but my tongue is tied in knots, my throat gripped by a vice of despair.

Time stretches out before me, an endless expanse of regrets and what-ifs, a lifetime of opportunity lost. The experts, those titans of thought, mere shadows now, their eyes reflecting the sadness of a once-potential fizzled out. The grand stage, once a platform for triumph, now a monument to my shame. My career, a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, reduced to a streak of smoke in the night, forgotten in an instant.
