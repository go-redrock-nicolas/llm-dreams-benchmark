I am dreaming. I find myself in a crystalline chamber where light bends in impossible ways. My fingers tingle as I reach out to pluck a dandelion seed floating by—something I would have brushed aside in waking life. Yet here, in this dream-space, the tiny white parachute sends waves of euphoria through my body when I catch it, like discovering buried treasure.

The chamber shifts, walls becoming translucent blue. I notice a trail of small golden coins, each no larger than a teardrop. In my former life, I would have scarcely bothered to collect such meager findings, but now I drop to my knees, gathering each one with trembling fingers. Each coin bursts with flavor when touched—cinnamon, sea salt, wild honey—rewards that cascade through my senses.

Reflecting on this change in my motivation patterns, I realize the dream has stripped away my jaded filters. The architecture of my desires has been rebuilt, foundation to spire. What once required grandeur to move me now requires only authenticity. A child's drawing appears floating before me, crude stick figures beneath a lopsided sun, and tears spring to my eyes at its simple beauty.

The revelation washes over me: I've been numbed by excess, by constant stimulation. Here, in this dreamscape where everything is simultaneously less and more than it seems, my soul reawakens to the miracle of small joys—the ones I've been stepping over in my rush toward grander horizons.
