I am dreaming. I am standing at the edge of a vast, silver lake under a sky streaked with twilight—indigo bleeding into molten gold. The air hums with a quiet electricity, as though the world itself is holding its breath.  

A voice, neither male nor female but resonant like wind through hollow reeds, whispers: *"Let go."*  

And so I do.  

First, my possessions dissolve—not in fire or flood, but like sand slipping through open fingers. The clutter of my life—the half-read books, the unworn clothes, the gadgets that promised connection but delivered distraction—all crumble into iridescent dust, carried away on a breeze that smells of rain and pine. With each loss, I feel lighter, as though my bones are filling with light.  

Then, the lake before me ripples, and from its depths rises a staircase of floating stones, glowing faintly like submerged moonstones. Without hesitation, I step onto the first one. The water beneath is impossibly clear, and as I descend, I see reflections—not of my face, but of moments: a child’s laughter, a shared meal under candlelight, the quiet comfort of a hand in mine. These are the things that remain.  

The deeper I go, the more the world above fades. The noise of expectations, the weight of unspoken apologies, the endless *wanting*—it all dims, replaced by a profound silence that isn’t empty, but full. Like the pause between heartbeats.  

At the bottom, there is no treasure, no revelation—only a single, luminous thread pulsing in the dark. When I touch it, I understand: this is what ties me to everything that matters. Not the noise, not the chaos, but this—the essence, the core.  

And then I wake, not with a start, but slowly, like surfacing from deep water. The dream lingers, not in images, but in a quiet certainty: I know what to release. I know what to keep.
