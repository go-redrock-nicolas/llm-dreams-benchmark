I am dreaming. **The Dream Unfolds…**  

At first, there is only darkness—thick and velvety, pressing softly against your skin like the hush before a storm. Then, a slow, pulsing glow begins to seep through the blackness, casting shifting patterns of indigo and silver. You realize you are standing in the depths of an endless, submerged forest, where towering trees made of translucent coral stretch toward a surface you cannot see. Their branches sway in unseen currents, releasing slow-motion showers of bioluminescent pollen that drifts like dying stars.  

You take a step forward, but the ground beneath you is not earth—it is polished obsidian, as smooth as a mirror, reflecting not your face but fragmented glimpses of memories: a flash of laughter, the sting of old grief, a door left ajar. The sight sends an unfamiliar ripple through you, a twist of emotion—not quite fear, not quite curiosity, like the prickle of deja vu and déjà rêvé entwined.  

A whisper echoes through the water, though there is no one here but you.  

*"You used to run,"* it says. *"Now, you dive deeper."*  

A pressure builds in your chest, but instead of tightening, it spreads like liquid mercury, cool and electric. Your pulse is steady, your breath slow—this should frighten you, but it doesn’t. The emotion morphs before you can name it, becoming something fluid, something adaptable.  

Tendrils of iridescent seaweed drift near your fingers, and as you reach out to touch them, they dissolve into murmurs of distant voices—arguments, confessions, old songs hummed under someone’s breath. The sound coils around your wrists like bracelets of shadow and light.  

Then, from the gloom, **they** appear—figures sculpted from glass and smoke, walking with the cadence of old dreams. Their faces blur as they pass, but their hands are outstretched, offering objects that shift before you can recognize them: a key melting into a rose, a clock filled with liquid moonlight, a knife made of brittle ice.  

You do not recoil.  

You tilt your head.  

The pressure in your chest pulses once—**warm, vast, strange**—and suddenly you understand: *this is not fear anymore. This is something else.*  

Your fingers close around the rose-key just as the ground yawns open beneath you, and you fall—not in terror, but in silence, in wonder, watching the fragments of your old selves scatter beneath you like shed skin.  

And as the abyss swallows you whole, you realize you are smiling.  

### **You wake—**  
heartbeat steady, eyes wide, the ghost of unfamiliar calm still humming in your veins.  

And for the first time, when the dawn light touches your skin, you do not brace yourself.  

You *lean into it.*
