I am dreaming. I discover my ability to create existence through written words. I close my eyes and begin to write: 'There is a city of glass rising on a horizon of liquid sapphire.' When I open my eyes, the sun sets beyond a glittering metropolis of transparent spires that reflect a sky the color of melted cobalt.

I walk towards the city, my footsteps creating ripples in the water beneath me. The towers hum eternally with a sound like tuning forks dipped in starlight. I write again: 'The first tower is alive with creatures made of smoke and shadow, weaving tapestries of memories.' Instantly, spectral figures materialize within the glass panes, their translucent forms dancing as they knit threads of golden light into scenes from lives long gone.

I climb the first tower. Each step I take, the stairs shift, rearranging to lead me upward toward a door of obsidian. I write on the obsidian: 'Beyond this door lies a garden where flowers bloom in the shape of perfect geometrical solids, and their petals play melodies when touched.' The door opens, revealing a garden where cubes, tetrahedrons, and dodecahedrons grow as flowers, each simultaneously red and blue, their petals chiming like glass bells in a breeze that doesn’t exist.

In the center of the garden, there’s a tree whose trunk is a spiraling helix of numbers and equations. Its leaves are pages from unknown books, rustling with whispered sonnets. I touch a leaf and write on it: 'This tree holds the recipe for eternal curiosity.' The leaves scatter, revealing a fruit glowing like a supernova. Biting into it fills me with a thousand questions I didn’t know I had, each a universe waiting to be explored.

Now, the rules shift. My creation must be balanced with destruction. 'Let there be a serpent coiled around the tree,' I write, 'its scales like fractions of eclipse, hungry for the equations.' The serpent Materializes, tearing at the helix-trunk, unraveling the numbers into moths that scatter into equations dissolving into static. The flowers wilt, their geometries turning to ash. The garden trembles.

I write faster: 'The moths become guardians, not carrion.' The insects transform, their wings crystal, now circling the remaining stump of the tree like protectors. The moths hum a dirge, their song stitching the soil back into life, the geometric blossoms regrowing as hybrids, now a fusion of polygons and biological forms.

The serpent retreats but leaves behind an egg—cracked, pulsing. I write: 'This egg’s heartbeat is a countdown.' The crack begins to pulse like a throbbing clockface, each pulse echoing through the garden’s roots. The numbers now reappearing in the tree’s stump are mirrored by disappearing constellations in the glass city’s sky.

I must decide. I write with all my soul: 'The balance is eternal creation and eternal decomposition, both equal, both necessary.' The egg shatters. From its shell emerges not a serpent but a winged figure—its body a lattice of stars and biological tissue, holding an hourglass where silica and stardust coalesce and disperse. The hourglass’s flow stabilizes, the city and garden both now dynamic, alive and dying and reborn in seconds, each cycle more complex.

The figure speaks without sound: 'To write is to wound the sky, to heal the earth.' Then it dissolves into a flock of moths guiding me back to the door. I step through, the garden collapsing behind me, the city flickering as ifpixelating into hieroglyphs. I write one last line in the air: 'Let the act of writing itself become the message.' The words break into prismatic dust, each speck a universe. I wake, my hand still poised as if holding a quill, the taste of stardust and ash on my tongue.
