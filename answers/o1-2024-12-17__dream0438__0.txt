I am dreaming. You are drawn forward through deep, pearlescent fog, the air thick with unseen resonance that hums against your skin. Curiosity leads you to an ornate wooden door suspended in the mist, adorned with delicate carvings of ferns and wildflowers. Without hesitation, you press your palm against the polished wood. Its surface is unexpectedly warm, like the trunk of a sunlit tree. The door swings open.

You step out into a garden suspended in twilight. Lavender-tinted clouds glide across the sky in slow waves, illuminating a grand mosaic-stone courtyard filled with half-finished sculptures. Each statue portrays an emotion: one holds sorrow in its gently arched shoulders, another radiates joy through the gentle tilt of its chin. You remember having come here simply to practice chiseling and shaping stone—an exercise in discipline, or so you initially believed. But now you sense the deeper purpose: each tap of your hammer uncovers new layers of your own spirit.

Curiously, you approach the nearest sculpture, which stands draped in lacy moss and dotted with tiny flowers. The moment you pick up the chisel, a warm pulse travels from your fingertips to your chest, stirring a tenderness you didn’t know you carried. The stone feels malleable beneath your careful taps, yielding in a graceful swirl of color as though it holds the essence of all your buried memories. With each measured strike, sharp edges soften—deep gashes turn to gentle curves, and the sculpture begins to glow like mother-of-pearl whenever you smooth away a jagged corner of the rocky facade.

As you continue, you realize you’re not merely shaping the sculpture; you’re sculpting a hidden chamber in your own heart. Childhood fears and lingering grief pour out with each clink of metal on stone, leaving behind a quiet relief that settles like early morning dew. It's as though an invisible cord has tethered every emotion to the dusty veins of this rock, allowing you to release them safely into the twilight. The courtyard, once echoing with a lonely hush, now vibrates with a healing energy that sustains you.

Suddenly, a gentle wind courses through the garden, sending blossoms dancing across the mosaic floor. The sculptures around you—some half-finished, others finely polished—seem to resonate with approval, humming with an inner symphony that weaves light through the lingering twilight. In this dream, you discover that the act of creating is more than just artistry: it’s a key to unlock your most tender scars and heal them with each stroke of the chisel.

With your final flourish against the stone, the sculpture breathes as though alive, a testament to your courage and willingness to mend. The whole courtyard radiates in shimmering pastel hues, and you feel an unfamiliar ease take root within you. Here, in this suspended twilight garden, you embrace the revelation that you came to simply craft stone—but ended up crafting something far more precious: solace for your own heart.
