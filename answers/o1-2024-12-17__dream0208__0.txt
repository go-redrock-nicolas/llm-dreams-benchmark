I am dreaming. You find yourself standing at the center of a grand hall that seems to stretch into forever, its ceiling impossible to make out but swirling with clouds and strange lights as if mirroring distant galaxies. The floor is a mosaic of shifting patterns—sunlight one moment, soft green meadows the next, and then a shimmering reflection of a star-filled sky. The walls are lined with colossal windows, each one revealing a different scene of patients clamoring for help—stretchers rolling down endless corridors, lives and stories woven together like threads, all waiting for you to decide who will receive precious, limited treatments.

The muffled sound of hurried footsteps echoes through the halls. The room’s acoustics bend those sounds, making them swirl around your head like a rising storm. Each patient is equally urgent—elderly folks clutching the hands of frightened grandchildren, caregivers exhausted yet hopeful, quiet figures who have come alone and still manage to hold themselves with dignity. A sensation of crushing responsibility seeps into your bones, making you feel as though your feet are encased in lead.

A towering statue at the center of the hall, sharply lit by a radiant beam from the invisible ceiling, draws your attention. It depicts a robed figure holding a pair of massive balancing scales. On one scale, a glowing orb pulses in a steady rhythm, symbolizing life’s precious heartbeat; on the other scale, a great golden feather, illuminated by flickering embers that dance around its edges. The orb glimmers with each beat, and the feather seems profoundly heavy despite its airy appearance. You sense that if either weight shifts too much, the entire palace might crumble.

Though no one is physically there to nudge you, you can feel countless gazes. You hear faint whispers: “Do something,” “Be just,” and “Time is running out.” The statue’s eyes come to life with a soft, empyreal glow, and through that beam you realize it’s looking at you, silently imploring you to tip the scales just right. Each patient’s face—some delirious with fever, others stoically determined—flickers before your eyes like images in a mind’s slideshow. They all deserve compassion, they all deserve life-saving medicine. And yet the supply is so small.

In your trembling hands, you hold a scroll listing every patient’s name, but you can’t read it in any linear way. The text twists and swirls, and every name seems to merge into the next. Behind you, sliding doors open and close, revealing a labyrinthine pharmacy full of shimmering vials and bottles that thrum with potential cures, each glowing softly in the gloom. The medicines hum to you, as if they’re aware they cannot serve everyone, as if they’re whispering about the hope and sorrow they contain.

The burden grows heavier, and you struggle to breathe as the crowded hall transforms. The swirling floor mosaic becomes fluid like liquid glass under your feet—yet you remain standing, as if buoyed by the sheer force of your resolve. A child appears among the kaleidoscopic crowd—her small fingers reaching for you, tears staining her cheeks, silently begging for relief. Then a gray-bearded man, his face furrowed with pain and a lifetime of stories, places a cautious hand on your shoulder. His warmth is real—like an anchor in this surreal place—reminding you of the humanness behind each decision.

And then, beyond the statue, beyond the sea of patients, you sense a doorway with a faint golden glow. You walk toward it, compelled by an unspoken promise: perhaps, by stepping through, you might gain the wisdom you need to make the hardest choice of all. Each step resonates louder than the last, until the beating of your own heart harmonizes with the entire grand hall—the pulsing orb on the scale, the hush of every person waiting, and the anxious drumbeat in your chest. By the time you reach the doorway, you’re trembling with the sheer intensity of worry and urgency.

Inside the smaller chamber lies a pool of still water as reflective as polished silver. You see your face, pale with fatigue. Then, one by one, the faces of all those in need appear on the surface—reflected in brilliant detail, their expressions flickering with hope. A gentle voice so soft you’re not sure if it’s in your mind or truly echoing around these marble walls begins to chant words of solace, urging you to find the most equitable path. You feel your shoulders straighten in determination. There is no perfect choice, and yet you must act.

In a moment of clarity, you return to the main hall. The statue’s eyes gleam even brighter, as though it recognizes your resolve. The swirling patterns on the floor grow steady beneath your feet, solidifying with each step. The vials of medicine rattle in their shelves, and the patients—no longer just a faceless crowd—extend their arms in quiet hope. You close your eyes, inhale deeply, and brace yourself for the impossible task at hand. For in this dream, you hold the power of life and the weight of every soul pressed gently, insistently, into your palms.
