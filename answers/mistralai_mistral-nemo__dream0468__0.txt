I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, undulating sea, its waves painting the shore with fleeting whispers of foam. The sun is a languid, orange bulge on the horizon, as if reluctant to abandon the day. A warm breeze tickles my skin, carrying with it the scent of salt and something else - a hint of distant rain in the air.

As I gaze out at the water, I notice a peculiar phenomena. The waves are not simply crashing upon the shore; they're pulsing with an otherworldly glow. Each crest is a cluster of bioluminescent constellations, casting an ethereal light upon the sand below. It's as if the very essence of the sea has been distilled into this dance of light and water.

I take a step forward, the sand shifting beneath my feet, cool and damp. As I walk further, I realize that the glow isn't just on the surface; it goes deep, illuminating schools of darting fish and the eerie, static dance of jellyfish below.

Suddenly, a rush of emotion washes over me, mirroring the rhythm of the sea. I feel the urge to shout out, to cry, to release this wave of feeling. I open my mouth, words tumbling out in a rush. "It's too much, all at once. The beauty, the chaos... it's overwhelming. I can't possibly make sense of it, not right now."

Just as I finish speaking, a wave builds taller than the rest, towering above me. It pauses, for a moment, poised like a question. Then, with a gentle sigh, it crashes down, enveloping me. I gasp, expecting the harsh tug of water, but instead, I am enveloped in a comforting, warm embrace.

As I settle into this embrace, I hear a voice, deep and resonant, like the rumble of a distant storm. "Not everything needs to be understood immediately," it says. "Sometimes, feeling is enough. And when you're ready, when you've had time to sit with it, you'll find the words come naturally."

The wave releases me, depositing me gently back onto the shore. I wake up, my heart full, my mind peaceful. I feel a new resolve, a determination to practice intentional communication. I will not speak merely to fill the void, but to share, to connect, to understand. I will wait, like the wave, until the moment is right. And when it is, my words will not rush out, unfiltered, but will flow like the tide, steady and sure.
