I am dreaming. You wake in the heart of a vast city plaza just as the sky ripples, like oil on water, and shudders.  One moment, clean sunlit air; the next, a thunderous crack splits the world—glass rains down, concrete fractures in jagged blooms, and a wave of panic sweeps through the crowd like wildfire.  Screams echo off towering skyscrapers as people stumble, clutching loved ones, eyes wide with confusion and fear.  Dust billows up in choking clouds, and red sparks dance where cables snap in the distance.  

Amid the chaos, your pulse pounds but your mind feels strangely calm.  You raise a trembling hand, and to your astonishment the swirling debris slows in midair, as if the chaos itself has hit an invisible wall.  Colors freeze: the scarlet flash of emergency lights, the green blur of an injured child’s jacket, the gray swirl of dust.  Time itself seems to hesitate.  Heartbeats echo in the hush.  

You discover that you’re able to bend the very fabric of this dream-reality—to pull at its threads and stitch them into new patterns.  With a single, focusing thought, you gather the frozen debris into a gentle vortex, guiding shattered steel beams and cracked slabs into graceful spirals overhead.  Then, as though performing an otherworldly ballet, you reshape them into a protective canopy above the panicked crowd.  What would have been crushing ruin becomes a vaulted dome of shimmering light, translucent and reassuring.  

As you step forward through the suspended dust motes—each one glowing like a tiny lantern—you feel a warmth spread from your chest.  You touch a terrified bystander’s shoulder.  In that instant, the thrumming terror in their eyes dissolves into grateful relief.  You shape that warmth into threads of golden calm, weaving them around each person in the square.  Panic recedes like a tide, and sobs give way to murmurs of wonder.  

Beneath the dome you’ve conjured, the fractured cityscape begins to knit itself back together.  Cracks seal with soft crackles of light; glass shards rejoin into perfect panes; evening’s first stars peek through the repaired skyline.  The crowd, now hushed and curious, looks up at you—no longer as victims but as witnesses to something miraculous.  

Then, as the last echoes of disaster transform into a gentle breeze, you realize the dream is revealing something greater: within you lies the power not only to stop destruction but to craft hope from its ashes.  And just as the world tilts toward dawn, you awaken—heart still thrumming, mind lit by the memory of a place where chaos bowed before the quiet strength of creation.
