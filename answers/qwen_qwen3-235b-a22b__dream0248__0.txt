I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The world around you is a city that cannot exist—a labyrinth of glass towers that ripple like liquid mercury under a violet sky, their reflections fracturing into a thousand versions of themselves in the rain-slicked streets. The air hums with the whispers of forgotten languages, and the ground beneath your feet shifts between cobblestone, ash, and something pulsing and organic, like the skin of a living thing. You walk without moving, pulled forward by a gravity that bends in spirals.  

Then you see them.  

A child, no older than six, kneeling in the center of a square that materializes around them like a stage. Their small body is wracked with sobs, hands clawing at their face as if trying to peel away their own skin. Their tears fall in slow motion, crystallizing into shards of ice before shattering on the ground. Their eyes—wide, luminous, and impossibly dark—lock onto yours. They open their mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. Instead, the scream becomes a flock of black birds that erupts from their throat, tearing through the air in a frenzy of wings and feathers.  

You watch.  

And you feel nothing.  

Not horror. Not pity. Not even curiosity. Your chest is a hollow chamber, your heartbeat a faint echo, as though your own body is a museum housing a corpse. You tilt your head, observing the child’s anguish as if it were a painting in a gallery of grotesques. A part of you knows this is wrong—this absence, this vacuum where empathy should bloom—but there is no guilt, no shame. Only a cold, clinical awareness that you are broken in a way that cannot be named.  

The city reacts to the child’s pain. Buildings twist into weeping willows, their windows bleeding sap. The sky splits open, spilling hourglasses full of burning sand. A river of liquid shadow surges up from the cracks in the ground, lapping at the child’s knees, then waist, then throat. They sink without struggling, their eyes never leaving yours, their silent scream now a silent plea.  

You do not reach out.  

You do not speak.  

You do not wake.  

Instead, you notice your hands. They are not your hands. They belong to someone older, someone with veins filled with mercury and scars that glow like dying stars. You flex them, fascinated by the way the light fractures across the skin. When you look back, the child is gone. The square is empty, save for a single raven perched atop a lamppost, its feathers dripping molten gold. It caws once, and the sound is the first thing you’ve heard in this dream that feels real.  

The raven hops, then transforms mid-air into a woman with hair like smoke and a dress woven from moth wings. She floats toward you, her voice a melody played on a broken piano.  

*"You buried it too deep,"* she says, though her lips do not move. *"Even the dead forget what you’ve forgotten."*  

She presses a hand to your chest, and for the first time, you feel something: a pressure, not from her touch, but from within—a door inside your ribs, rusted shut, behind which something small and bright claws at the metal, whimpering.  

You wake before you can open it.  

But the numbness clings to you, a residue of the dream, as you blink at the ceiling. The birds outside their window are singing. Somewhere, a child laughs. You wait for the echo of relief, the warmth of being alive.  

It does not come.
