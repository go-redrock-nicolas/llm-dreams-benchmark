I am dreaming. The wind whips around me as I stand at the edge of a shimmering glass bridge, suspended impossibly high between two ancient mountain peaks shrouded in swirling mist. Far below, a raging river appears as thin as a silver thread, its waters churning against jagged rocks. The assembled crowd of thousands watches from viewing platforms carved into the mountainsides, their collective breath held in tense anticipation.

I'm meant to perform "The Phoenix Leap" - a death-defying stunt where I must run across the transparent bridge as it systematically shatters behind me, then launch myself into a spiraling aerial flip before catching a golden rope that will materialize at precisely the right moment. No one has ever completed it successfully. The last three who attempted it vanished into the misty depths below.

My heart thunders in my chest, but strangely, my hands are steady. The glass beneath my feet begins to hum with an ethereal tone, signaling the start. The crowd gasps as the first panel splinters into a spiderweb of cracks. Time seems to slow.

I begin to run, my footfalls creating musical notes as they strike the glass. Behind me, panels explode into glittering shards that catch the light like falling stars. The shattering gains on me with each step. The golden rope is nowhere in sight. The final panel begins to crack beneath my feet.

In this suspended moment between solid ground and empty air, I feel an inexplicable sense of serenity. My body knows exactly what to do, as if I've rehearsed this moment in a thousand other dreams. I push off from the last dissolving shard of glass, twisting into a spiral that feels more like flying than falling. The world spins around me in a blur of mountain peaks and misty depths.

And there - materializing exactly where I somehow knew it would be - streams the golden rope, its metallic fibers sparkling like captured sunlight...
