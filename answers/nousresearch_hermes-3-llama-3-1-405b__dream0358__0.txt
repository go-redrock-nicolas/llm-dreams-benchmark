I am dreaming. It starts with me entering into a world of colours and shapes so vivid they dazzle my eyes. Ahead of me is a seemingly endless forest of radiant trees, with leaves so bright they seem to be smiles of the sun itself. Each leaf a slightly different hue, together they form a breathtaking symphony of colors.

I start down a path leading into the heart of the forest. The air around me quivers with life, laden with scents of dew-drenched earth, fresh blooms, and ripe fruits. A soft, silvery mist weaves through the tree trunks, and each footstep causes ripples to flow through it, like waves fleeing from a stone disturbing a still pond.

Soon, I reach a clearing where a river runs, its water pure and tranquil. The river is brimming with life - luminous fishes dart around, their scales glinting under the sunlight that filters through the canopy above. On the riverbank, creatures of all kinds exist in harmony - from tiny, jewel-like insects to large, regal looking beasts, all co-existing in a serene eco-system.

As I watch, I see that this harmony extends towards the plant life too. Vines of flowers extend towards the river, dipping their petals into the water, as if drinking from it. The sight makes me realise my own thirst, and I kneel at the riverbank and cup my hands to drink. The water is sweet, cool, refreshing, more satisfying than any drink I've ever had.

Suddenly, the scene starts to shift. The sky grows dark with storm clouds, the wind picks up, howling as it whips the trees into a frenzy. The once calm river is now a torrent of rushing water, and the animals have all disappeared. I feel a sense of intense despair rising within me, but I don't understand why.

Soon, I'm drenched, both from the rain and from the tears that have started to fall uncontrollably from my eyes. My sobs are drowned out by the roar of the storm, but my grief is a tangible thing, a heavy weight lodged within my chest.

As quickly as it came, the storm is gone. The sun peers out from behind the clouds, and the forest starts to heal itself. The wind dies down, the river calms, and the animals return from their hideaways.

Though my emotional storm is still raging within me, I feel a sense of calm watching the forest regain its peace. I know I have the strength to resolve my inner turmoil, like the forest weathered the storm.

As the last traces of the storm clear away, it is time for me to leave this dream. I carry the resilience of the forest in my heart, ready to face my waking life.

Then, I wake up.
