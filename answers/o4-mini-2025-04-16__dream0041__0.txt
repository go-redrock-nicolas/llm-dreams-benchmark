I am dreaming. You find yourself floating just above a stage carved from moonstone, its pale surface glowing with an inner light. Arc-shaped balconies rise on all sides, each seat occupied by experts in long, flowing robes stitched with symbols you can’t quite read. Their faces blur and sharpen with every blink—some intently curious, others coolly analytical—yet all their eyes burn like embers in the half-dark. A distant chorus hums, as though the very walls are breathing music into the air.

You look down and realize you’re clutching nothing but a scrap of parchment, its words blurring into indecipherable runes. Your pulse hammers in your ears. The seconds stretch and warp. Somewhere behind you, a single spotlight flickers on, casting a thin shaft of luminescence straight onto your trembling hands. You sense the auditorium tighten, an electric hush pressing in from every corner.

Heart pounding, you step onto the stage. The ground ripples like liquid glass beneath your feet, and the hum of the unseen choir pulses in time with your breath. You raise your head, but the parchment slips from your fingers—melting into silver mist before it even touches the floor. Panic roars in your chest. You’re about to present avant-garde equations to minds far more brilliant than your own, and now you have nothing but raw nerves.

Then, without warning, the moonstone stage transforms. Geometric constellations appear beneath your shoes; each step sends a tiny galaxy spinning into being. The audience leans forward, crisp whispers like wind through dry leaves brushing past. Their expectation feels almost tangible—as if they’re ready to catch every spark from your next thought.

Silence tightens its grip around you. You close your eyes and push past the fear. In that small, steady moment you remember: you do know this. The patterns, the theorems, the wild leaps of logic that once danced so clearly in your mind—they’re still there, waiting for you to call them forth. A deep, inner light stirs. You open your eyes, and the experts’ faces, instead of judging, now glimmer with anticipation.

You speak. Your voice is soft at first, barely more than a ripple, but with every word the stage responds: lines of fluorescent script snake across the moonstone, equations weaving together in living color. The audience leans in, and you feel their curiosity feed into your words like oxygen. The symbols you conjure swirl above your head in a great, spiraling helix of light, illuminating every corner of the hall.

By the time you finish, the entire dome shimmers with your creation. A hush falls—and then, spontaneous and thunderous, applause erupts. It rings like liquid crystal, reverberating through your chest and lifting you higher than ever before. As the experts rise, their smiles are warm, respectful, even admiring. You bow, breathless and glowing from within, and in that moment you understand: the real preparation was always inside you, waiting beneath the fear, ready to ignite.

Then you wake—heart still racing, fingertips tingling with possibility—carrying with you a quiet, unshakeable confidence that even the most daunting stage can be mastered when you let your own light guide the way.
