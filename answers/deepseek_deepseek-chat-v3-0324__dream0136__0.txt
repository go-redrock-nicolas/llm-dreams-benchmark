I am dreaming. **The Dream:**  

You stand in the wings of a colossal, opulent theater—velvet curtains the color of midnight sway in a phantom breeze, gilded carvings shimmering under flickering gas lamps. The air hums with anticipation, thick with the mingling scents of sweat, perfumes, and something electric, like ozone before a storm.  

Then comes the frantic whisper—*"You're on. Now."*  

The lead performer—**The Mirage**, a legend whose name alone makes audiences weep—has collapsed, pale and sweating, just moments before the final act. The show *must* go on. The theater owner—a silver-eyed man with a voice like crumbling parchment—presses a mask into your hands. It’s cold, weightless, yet seems to pulse against your skin, as if alive. **The Mirage’s mask.**  

Before you can protest, you’re pushed forward—onto a stage so vast, it feels like standing at the edge of the world. A thousand eyes gleam in the darkness, watching, waiting. The orchestra holds its breath.  

And then—you *change.*  

Not consciously, not willingly. The mask *fuses* to you, slithering over your face like liquid silver. Your body isn’t yours anymore. It moves with a grace you’ve never known, limbs bending like shadow, arms unfurling in impossible arcs. Music you’ve never heard floods your veins, and suddenly, you *understand*.  

This isn’t performance. This is *possession.*  

The audience gasps as you leap—a soaring, weightless arc—only to dissolve mid-air into a cascade of black feathers that scatter and reform as you land. You sing, but the voice isn’t human; it’s the wail of a storm, the whisper of a forgotten god. The crowd is screaming, weeping, some gripping their chests as if their hearts might burst from sheer rapture.  

Yet beneath the ecstasy—*fear.*  

The mask is *hungry.* It drinks their awe, their terror. And soon, it’ll want more.  

You don’t know the act’s ending. But you *feel* it coming—the grand finale. The mask tightens. The stage *tilts,* the chandeliers dim—  

And then you wake.  

(Your hands are shaking. Your lips taste like copper.)
