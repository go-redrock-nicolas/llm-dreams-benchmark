I am dreaming. …I blink and the vague fog of sleep unfurls into a city street that glows like polished obsidian after rain. Neon signage flickers overhead, but every syllable on those signs is rendered in the delicate coils of cuneiform, as though the very first alphabet has been plugged into modern power lines. I inhale, and the air tastes of jasmine and distant thunder.

Ahead, a bicycle messenger weaves through traffic. At first he seems ordinary—a fluorescent vest, a canvas bag slung across his chest—yet his sandals have wings stitched into the straps, fluttering faintly even while he coasts. He looks over his shoulder and winks. Hermes, I realize, courier of the impossible, threading divine errands through rush-hour chaos. He whistles, and the traffic lights ripple green like emerald water to clear a path. I follow, sneakers slapping wet pavement.

Hermes darts into a narrow alley, and the city suddenly quiets. Each brick in the walls around me is carved with labyrinthine etchings. The alley stretches into a colonnade that should not fit behind skyscrapers, its pillars made of river-worn stone and lacquered street art. At the far end stands a graffitied mural of a woman with midnight-blue skin and a garland of severed neon light tubes. The mural’s arms unfold, step forward, and Kali strides out of the paint. She wears Doc Martens spattered with cosmic dust and metal bangles that clang like subway doors. With four hands she juggles a smartphone, a skull, a pair of scissors, and a blooming rose grown from shimmering circuitry.

She speaks, her voice an earthquake and a lullaby at once: “Destruction and rebirth scroll through your timeline, child. Which notification will you open?” The question echoes in my bones; I’m suddenly holding my own phone, its screen blank but pulsing like a heartbeat. Before I can answer, the ground trembles and the alley melts into a subway platform lined with basalt.

A tall figure in a conductor’s cap—Anubis in pressed charcoal uniform—steps from the operator’s booth of a silver train. Jackal eyes gleam gold beneath the brim. He punches a ticket made of papyrus and offers it to me. Hieroglyphs swirl across its surface, configuring themselves into the names of everyone I’ve ever lost. My throat tightens. Anubis tilts his head, both compassionate and unyielding. I pocket the ticket.

The train lurches into motion without the roar of engines—more like the hush of a river slipping under ice. Windows flash with scenes from my own life spliced into myth: my childhood bedroom layered with the labyrinth of Knossos; my first heartbreak rippling across the River Styx; my laughter stitched into the Arachne’s web. Passengers morph: classmates become nymphs, baristas become satyrs, strangers glow with starlight.

When the doors hiss open, I step into a library that hums like a beehive. Shelves spiral upward beyond sight, filled with books whose spines are feathered, scaled, or made of hammered bronze. In the central oculus, a single shaft of moonlight falls upon a desk where Athena sits in a bomber jacket embroidered with constellations. Her owl roosts on a stack of graphic novels. She slides a blank notebook toward me. The pages flutter, revealing faint outlines—shadow shapes waiting for ink.

“You write the latest song of the spheres,” Athena says, tapping the notebook. “Old archetypes crave new verses. We offer our echoes, but you supply the voice.”

I open the notebook, and words spill out of my fingertips like molten silver: stories I haven’t written yet, universities I haven’t attended, mistakes I haven’t made, joys I haven’t tasted. The ink fills the outlines, and each completed page bursts into a constellation that rises to join the fresco of stars overhead.

Suddenly, a thunderclap—Zeus somewhere in the rafters, perhaps critiquing my prose with celestial applause. The shockwave scatters the constellations, but instead of fading they reassemble into a woven thread of light that cascades into my hands. It is Ariadne’s thread, luminescent yet weightless, leading me forward.

I turn and see a door at the far edge of the library, carved from living wood that still blooms with almond blossoms. The thread tugs me toward it. As I approach, Persephone stands before the doorway in a sundress patterned with pomegranate seeds. She smiles with the kindness of someone who has known every season of the soul.

“Above or below, the seed cracks to become its truest self,” she says, offering me a seed that glows like a ruby ember. I place it on my tongue. It dissolves into sweetness and autumn smoke simultaneously.

The door swings open to reveal the original city street again, drenched now in sunrise. The winged bicycle messenger waits, Kali skates down a handrail laughing, Anubis tips his cap, Athena nods from a rooftop, and Persephone’s blossoms ride the warming wind. They are all present, all mythic, yet all wearing the hoodies, earbuds, and coffee cups of my own century.

Hermes calls out, “Wake gently, dreamer. Carry us with you. Remix the myth.”

I inhale morning air threaded with ambrosia and asphalt, and as I exhale, the dream lifts like cathedral bells in reverse, leaving a shimmering residue of archetypes clinging to the edges of daybreak.
