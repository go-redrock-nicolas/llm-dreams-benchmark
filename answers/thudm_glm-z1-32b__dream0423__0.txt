I am dreaming. I notice a flickering light in the corner of my eye, a faint shadow that seems to elongate tendrils towards me. At first, I dismiss it as a product of the twilight outside my window, but as I turn to confront it, the shadow solidifies into a figure made of smoke and whispering echoes. 

This entity, half-formed yet hauntingly familiar, begins to mirror my movements with uncanny precision. When I step forward, it mirrors my pace; when I hesitate, it pauses, its smoky form rippling as if pulled by an unseen force. A chill creeps down my spine—not from fear, but from recognition. This isn't a stranger; it's a reflection of the doubts and insecurities I've been ignoring in a relationship that's starting to unravel. 

The air grows thick with static, and the room's colors bleed into smeared watercolors. The entity begins to speak, but each word is a collage of memories: moments of laughter diluted with silent pauses, texts left unanswered, and promises made in haste. Every syllable is a thorn, pricking at the layers of denial I've built around the truth. 

I wake with a jolt, my sheets tangled around me, the moonlight now cruelly bright. The dream lingers, a tapestry of truths I can no longer dismiss. The next day, I sit down with my partner, not with confrontation, but with vulnerability. We speak of the shadows between us—of the cracks where trust has seeped out, and the places where love still burns, fiercely and real. 

The dream, once a specter, becomes a bridge. The mirrors of our relationship, once cracked, start to reflect not just our flaws, but also the strength in our willingness to see.
