I am dreaming. I stand in a circular room of mirrored glass, my reflection fractured into countless versions of myself. The news I've just received—words that have shattered something vital inside me—still rings in my ears. My hands tremble slightly, but around me are watching eyes, expectant faces. I cannot crumble here.

The floor beneath me begins to liquefy, becoming a pool of shimmering mercury that reflects the constellation of lights above. I feel myself sinking, but not drowning—rather, the liquid metal holds me suspended between worlds.

As my emotions surge and threaten to break through, each feeling materializes in the air around me—rage becomes crimson birds with razor wings, grief transforms into vines of indigo that reach for my throat, fear manifests as a fine mist that smells of winter storms.

I breathe deeply, and with each exhalation, I transform these manifestations. The birds dissolve into ruby dust that settles on my shoulders like armor. The vines bloom with luminous flowers that absorb my sorrow. The mist crystallizes into prisms that scatter light across the room.

The watching eyes don't see this internal alchemy. To them, I remain composed, nodding slightly as words continue to flow around me. But inside this dream-world, I've created a sanctuary within the storm—a place where pain transforms into strength, where vulnerability becomes a kind of power.

The mercury rises, enveloping me completely now, and I realize I can breathe within it. My reflection shows not fracture but wholeness—a self holding contradictions with grace. The devastating news doesn't diminish; instead, I expand to contain it.

I am both shattered and whole, broken and healing, vulnerable and invincible—suspended in this glittering moment between collapse and transcendence.
