I am dreaming. I find myself standing in a vast, endless expanse of shimmering golden sand, stretching out in all directions as far as the eye can see. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of swirling colors - vibrant purples, deep blues, and ethereal greens, all dancing and blending together in a mesmerizing celestial ballet. It's a place both surreal and strangely familiar, like a memory from a past life.

As I take in the breathtaking vista, I notice a shimmering figure approaching me across the sands. As they draw closer, I realize with a start that it is myself - or rather, a reflection of my inner self, my true essence. This dream-self radiates an otherworldly glow, eyes sparkling with ancient wisdom and compassion.

"Greetings, dear one," the dream-self smiles warmly as it reaches me, wings of pure light unfurling from its back. "I bring you a message from the deepest parts of your soul."

I incline my head, transfixed. "The deepest parts of my soul...But what message could that possibly be?"

The dream-self chuckles, a melodic sound that resonates through my being. "That message is this: beloved, you have been far too hard on yourself. You have unknowingly placed yourself under relentless pressure, setting standards that are impossible to meet. You have languished under the weight of your own expectations."

A pang of realization and sorrow pierces my heart as I bow my head. The sand around us seems to sigh with me. "I...I suppose you're right. I've always pushed myself to absurd limits, believing I could be better than I was. But I'm tired of running on this endless treadmill. Surely there must be a kinder way?"

The dream-self reaches out and caresses my cheek with a hand of pure light. "There is indeed, sweet child. You must learn to embrace yourself as you are - flaws, strengths, and all. Celebrate your progress rather than fixating on perfection. Be gentle on yourself. Rest when you need to. Love yourself as unconditionally as you would your dearest friend."

I blink away tears, my vision blurring. "But how? How do I let go of all these harsh ideals I've clung to for so long?"

"The answer is simple," the dream-self replies serenely, "If we could soothe ourselves, even imperfectly, with what we say, to comfort ourselves, with what we say, to release the pain, to heal ourselves with what we offer ourselves... Then all would be healed. Open your heart to yourself. Listen to your needs with compassion and understanding. And learn to set boundaries, to know your limits. This is the path to wholeness."

The dream-self hugs me close, wrapping me in its luminous wings. I feel love pour into me like liquid gold. My body relaxes, my mind quieting as I breathe in peace. The swirling sky pulses with energy as if mirroring my own renewal.

"You are worthy of peace, dear heart. You are worthy of grace. You are worthy of love and kindness, no matter how many times you fall short of your own lofty standards." The dream-self pulls back, giving me a parting smirk. "And remember, you alone have the power to set your own expectations. And to revise them as needed. Be your own best friend. Now, go in peace and be well."

The golden sands begin to fade, the sky changing rapidly. I suddenly find myself jolted awake, heart pounding, mind spinning with vivid images. I sit up in my bed, gasping for breath in the darkness. But lingering in my mind is the bittersweet message from my dream-self, and I realize with a rush of emotion that my vision is trying to share. That no, I am not alone, and yes, I am worthy of peace. I am worthy of being pleased with my efforts, my progress. Of having healthy expectations for myself.

That all I need is compassion from my own heart. And that I am holding myself in place with such standards - but I don't have to. My best is enough and that is all. With that I fall back asleep, a serene smile on my face.
