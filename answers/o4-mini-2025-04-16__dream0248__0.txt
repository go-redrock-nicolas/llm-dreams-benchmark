I am dreaming. You find yourself standing on a broad, glassy plain at dusk, the sky a slow swirl of bruised purples and molten gold.  A single figure staggers toward you across the gleaming surface, their shoulders shaking in ragged sobs.  Each tear they shed cracks the ground beneath your feet, spiderwebbing in pale white lines.  Yet in the hollow between your ribs you feel…nothing.  No pity, no sorrow—only cool detachment, as if their grief belongs to someone else’s dream.

Realizing how utterly unmoved you are, the world around you ripples.  The sobbing person dissolves into a storm of silver shards that whirl upward, joining the swirling dusk overhead.  You lift a hand, and the shards answer, collecting into a mirror that hovers before you.  In its depths you study your own face—and see only stillness.  The absence of feeling it shows is deeper than any shadow.  

Without warning, the mirrored sky cracks open, and you step through into a new landscape.  Here, gravity drips like candle wax, and gigantic roots of living midnight-blue coil across the horizon.  You wander until you find a withered tree whose bark pulses faintly with red veins.  Pressing your palm against it, you sense a buried heartbeat—slow, desperate.  You realize this tree holds memories of empathy once felt by strangers in every life you will never live.  

As you reach toward that rhythmic thrum, a fracture opens behind you, summoning the face of the crying stranger once more.  Their eyes—wide, pleading—reflect your image, as though seeking the spark that eludes you.  For an instant, you consider fleeing into the root-tangled darkness, forever free of their need.  But then a single pulse from the tree’s heart shivers through your bones, and you stand your ground, poised on the brink between indifference and something wholly unknown.  In that breathless moment, your empty chest trembles, as if the dream itself has held its breath—waiting to see whether you will turn away, or finally let something awake inside you.
