I am dreaming. As you walk tentatively along the diminishing path, the howling wind bears the whispers of ancient mmemories, wearing the form of spectral figures that dance wispy-fingered across the gale. Their eyes, twin diamonds, cut through the whirling snow, fixing you with a gaze as piercing as the mountain's own frozen heart. The ridge - a mere thread of black stone against the ice-canvased valley - stretches out before you, beckoning you to follow its precarious flight towards the heavens.

A sudden gust spins you around, your coat flapping theaterscally, and you catch sight of the storm's mouth yawning wide behind. Sheets of white consume the world, snarling like a wild beast, eager to swallow you whole. Yet, as you spin back to face the mountains, a fleeting lull in the storm reveals a mirage. Nestled in the crook of the peaks, a city floats, its spires and minarets aglow with warm, golden lights. It's a vision plucked straight from the pages of a fairy tale, its existence in this desolate realm as impossible as it is breathtaking.

The blizzard roars, vying for your attention, its claws tearing at the mountain's skin, spewing boulders and ice shards into your path. You duck, dive, and dodge, each movement an act of defiance against the storm's wrath. With each heart-pounding roll of the thunder, the dream urban landscape flickers like a faulty projector reel, threatening to blink out of existence. As the ridge beneath you twists into sharp crags, you find yourself climbing, not merely walking, the mountain's inhospitable face.

At last, the city seems within grasp. An enormous castle gate materializes through the snow, its archway adorned with intricate carvings of mythical beasts and celestial bodies. A single, ancient key, its teeth worn smooth by age, stands upright in the lock, waiting. As you grasp the cool metal, the gate creaks open, revealing a courtyard filled with residents frozen mid-step, their surprised expressions locked in time. They're immortalized, it seems, by some otherworldly force, their lives captured in the very moment they were about to leave their homes and brave the storm themselves.

Suddenly, you're no longer dreaming. You're living inside their memories, tasting their companionship, their courage. The blizzard dwindles to a purr, the mountain frees itself from your feet, and the city's magic hums through your veins. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the vision begins to fade, the golden lights dimming until only darkness remains. But you know - you know - that the city is still there, floating, waiting, just beyond the reaches of human touch. And when you open your eyes to the world of the waking, you carry a piece of its magic within, a beacon to guide you through the toughest storms.
