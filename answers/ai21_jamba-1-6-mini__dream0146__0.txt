I am dreaming. You're caught in a rapidly intensifying wildfire with no clear escape route. As the smoke thickens and the flames approach from multiple directions, you feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. The heat is unbearable, the sound of the advancing fire is like a roaring beast, and the smell of burning vegetation is nauseating. Every direction you turn seems more dangerous than the last. You hear the screams of people around you, and despite your fear, you instinctively start running toward what seems like a safer path. Your heart pounds in your chest, and you're gasping for air, struggling to stay calm amidst the chaos.
