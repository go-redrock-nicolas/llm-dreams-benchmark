I am dreaming. The air itself pulses with liquid electricity here. I’m standing at the edge of a mirrored abyss, gelatinous and gleaming, where stars swim beneath my feet like phosphorescent eels tangled in the roots of gravity. Cities bloom around me, but they’re built of sound—spires of cello crescendos, bridges woven from whispered secrets, every streetlamp a frozen chord struck aeons ago. I devour a pomegranate, and the juice tastes of quadrillion-digit prime numbers cascading down my throat, each seed a fractal planet tearing continents into calculus. Nearby, a clockwork tiger prowls, its gears spinning backward to milk entropy from the void. When it roars, the moon cracks open, spilling honeyed obsidian that hardens into staircases leading to rooms where time knots itself into origami cyclones. No laws bind here; even the physics flinches when I laugh. I pluck the tiger’s whiskers to string a lute made of my own ribcage, playing a melody that shatters windows in forgotten civilizations. Echoes ripple out as blood-red starlings, stitching the sky into a quilt of want. Desire here isn’t hunger—it’s alchemy. I unhinge my jaw and swallow the horizon, digesting its light into a supernova coiled in my gut. The mirrors applaud in shattered voices. Of course they do. This is my dream. It bends. It breaks. It *begs*.
