I am dreaming. …rise from an obsidian seat that levitates at the navel-height of a starless courtroom. The Tribunal of Breaths—the cosmic gathering that called you here—falls into a hush so complete that you can hear the universe ticking like a pendulum somewhere behind the vaulted darkness.  

Before you stand the two litigants.

On the left, draped in tessellating feathers of ultraviolet light, is Seraphiel of the Dawnward Chorus. Every time it exhales, you taste the flavor of sunrise: sweet citrus, iron tang, and the promise of unfinished poems. It argues for Change—the forward churn of time, the relentless birth of novelty, the unspooling of future after future.

On the right, robed in glacier-slow ribbons of petrified moonlight, looms Thrennos of the Deep Still. Its eyes are black holes that hum lullabies of silence, and its cloak weeps snowflakes that never touch the floor. Thrennos pleads for Preservation—perfect stasis, the museum-glass pane over every moment that was and ever could be.

Your gavel is no wooden mallet; it is a living meteor, warm and breathing, pulled from the primeval forge at the center of all stars. Around you, the jurors—anthropomorphic constellations, thought-forms older than gravity, extinct gods nibbling galaxies like sugar cubes—lean forward.

You inhale.

The air is thick with paragraphs of possible realities. You feel them sliding down your throat like pages from a molten book—each option a future civilization, each swallow a potential extinction.

You speak.

“I have listened to the brass argument of Becoming and the silver argument of Being,” you begin, voice amplified by a choir of echoing selves that peel away from your body like translucent duplicates, each one articulating the syllables a half-second late. “I have weighed every ripple, every lull. But there is a third path hidden between your polar gravities.”

Seraphiel flickers, feathers crackling with auroras. Thrennos tilts its glacier face, ice groaning in surprise.

You continue.

“I rule for the Covenant of Breathing Moments.”

The courtroom shudders as if struck by a rogue moon. Pillars of condensed probability bloom like lightning in slow motion. In a single heartbeat, you define your verdict:

1. The universe will move forward, but memory shall calcify certain instants into eternal sanctuaries—unchangeable shrines floating inside the river of time.  
2. Change may enter these shrines only when a living consciousness re-experiences them with wonder, thereby carving a microscopic channel through which novelty can trickle.  
3. Stasis may blanket any moment only when its stillness teaches some future traveler the value of departure.

This covenant binds both entities: Change gains humility, Preservation gains purpose. Together they become custodians of a breathing, pulsing cosmos—neither a runaway storm nor a suffocating tomb.

You raise the living meteor, slam it once onto the obsidian dais. It erupts into a corolla of sparks that orbit your head like incandescent fireflies spelling out the ruling in glyphs older than syntax.

Seraphiel bows, wings folding into an origami sun. Thrennos kneels, robes pooling like spilled moonlight. A tidal silence rolls through the hall, then recedes, leaving behind a hush that smells of petrichor and burnt parchment.

The jurors sign the verdict by shedding scales of starlight that drift upward, forming a signature across the ceiling—the longest, most brilliant comet you’ve ever seen.

You feel the courtroom dissolve into a glittering mist. The chair evaporates beneath you; gravity forgets its job. You are weightless, suspended in the interstice between waking and whatever comes after a dream of this magnitude.

As the mist dissipates, you glimpse billions of worlds branching from your decision. Some sparkle like newborn pearls; others look like cracked mirrors reflecting cautionary tales. They swarm around you, a murmuring orbit of might-have-beens and inevitable-shall-bes.

A soft gong—a single note of cosmic applause—reverberates across the void.

And then you wake, the echo still vibrating in your bones, the scent of sunrise-and-snow lingering in your lungs, the living meteor now only a warm pulse in your palm where your fist lies closed against the bedsheets.
