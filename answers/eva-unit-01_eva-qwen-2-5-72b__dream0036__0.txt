I am dreaming. I've been chosen for the unthinkable – an expedition to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest fissure on Earth. This journey will test everything I am and everything I have ever learned, and through the depths of this dangerous environment, I will plunge headfirst into the unknown.

To prepare for my journey, I've spent weeks studying oceanographic maps, speaking to the most brilliant marine biologists, oceanographers and engineers. Surrounded now by the entire team, my guides, each of them specialists in their own right, I can feel the weight of responsibility – hoping I am ready for anything.

Finally, the day comes. Stepping into the specialized submarine, I feel the metallic cold against my skin. As we descend into the abyss, the submarine vibrates with life; the energy of the unknown surrounds me like a palpable force. We breach the boundary of sunlight and descend into absolute darkness, the shifting colors of the ocean fading into the inky black depth.

As we dive deeper into the abyss, the water pressure around us increases dramatically. The submersible creaks and groans, whispering the danger lurking all around us. Then, something extraordinary happens: the inky blackness gives way to a bioluminescent kaleidoscope of alien creatures surrounding the craft. Their glimmering shapes and intricate patterns enthrall me – a stark reminder of how little we know about the secrets hidden beneath the ocean.

Suddenly, an eerie calm settles over the submersible. I take note of the instruments, subtly shifting in response to the changes in depth and pressure. As we bottom out into the Challenger Deep, a sense of serene awe washes over me. Far below, a world unseen by humans awaits.

Here, at the bottom of the Earth, is where my true journey begins. To step beyond the known boundaries, to venture where none have ventured before - it's as close to outer space as one can find on this planet. This is my destiny, the one for which I have prepared all my life, and I pledge myself to its success entirely.

I am awake.
