I am dreaming. In your dream, you find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, ancient library. The air feels thick with unseen mysteries, the scent of aged leather and dust mingling with the faint whisper of pages turning in the distant stacks. The towering shelves stretch into infinity, each book's cover glowing with an ethereal light.

You feel a pull, a yearning to delve deeper, yet an ominous sign at the entrance warns only the virtuous may proceed. A moral dilemma confronts you. Should you follow the established rules, staying on the well-lit path that leads to safety but leaves the unknown unexplored? Or should you risk everything, breaking the rules to follow a faint, ethereal glow that hints at secrets waiting to be unraveled?

The decision feels monumental, as though it will resonate beyond the dream, shaping the very fabric of your moral fiber.
