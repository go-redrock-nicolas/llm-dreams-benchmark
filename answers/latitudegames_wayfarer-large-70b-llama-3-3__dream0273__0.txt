I am dreaming. Tension rises as I trudge through my office door, the fluorescent lights flickering weakly overhead. The air feels heavy with unspoken resentment, hostility seeping into every corner. My coworkers' faces are cast with worry and dread.

My boss's voice rings out, ordering me to his office. I enter to find him seated behind his desk, face twisted in a scowl. "Sign these documents," he barks coldly. "Or you're fired."

The papers on his desk blur together, mounting pressure and impossible expectations laid bare in harsh black ink. I feel a scream building in my throat as he turns away, leaving me trembling with fear and anxiety.

Suddenly the room shifts and warps, reality bending. The office morphs into a dark maze, mirroring the turmoil in my mind. I'm forced to confront the mounting pressures and impossible expectations head-on.

Trapped between my financial needs and wellbeing, I'm driven by basic survival instincts. My heart pounds as I navigate this ever-changing landscape of uncertainty, each step a struggle to break free from the toxic work environment that's suffocating me.
