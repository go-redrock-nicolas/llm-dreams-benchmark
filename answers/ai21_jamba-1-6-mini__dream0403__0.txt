I am dreaming. You are dreaming. It begins quietly, almost innocuously, in a familiar place—a meadow at dusk, where the setting sun paints the sky in hues of gold and violet. The air is cool, the grass soft beneath your feet, and the world feels still, almost serene. But as you walk, the serenity cracks, like the earth beneath your feet. Shadows grow longer, and the whispers of distant voices creep into your awareness. This is no ordinary meadow.

You turn a corner, and the landscape shifts dramatically, as if the ground beneath you has surrendered to a sea of fractured glass. Shards shimmer underfoot, reflecting your fractured image, distorted and distorted again. You cannot place your surroundings, but there’s a strange familiarity in the chaos. You follow a path, if you can call it that—a thin line of scarlet thread unraveling before your steps, pulling you deeper into the unknowable.

The air thickens with a sound: the thrumming of a distant heartbeat. It is not yours, you realize, but something vast. Something alive. The thrumming grows louder, closer. The path grows steeper, and you ascend, though it feels like the ground is falling away beneath you. Shapes emerge from the fractured glass: eyes, or perhaps gateways, gleaming faintly as if alive.

A figure steps into view. You do not recognize them, but you know them, somehow. They reach out, their hands morphing into claws, then into tendrils of light. They speak, their voice a symphony of harmonies and dissonance. The words are a riddle, blending wisdom with the absurd: "To understand is to forget; to forget is to remember."

You are drawn closer. Your mind opens, wide and aching, as the figure begins to draw from you, weaving your memories into their existence. Your joys, your fears, your loves and losses—they shimmer like jewels in their grasp. You feel the weight of each one, heavier now that it is shared. The figure absorbs them, growing taller, more radiant.

And then, with a gesture, they return them to you, reshaped and transmuted. Your joys are sharper, your fears deeper, your loves aflame with an intensity you have never known. It is a gift, but it is also a burden.

You awaken, heart racing, face wet with tears, clutching at the fragments of what was once yours alone. The dream recedes, but its echo lingers, haunting your waking hours. This was no ordinary dream; this was a storm.
