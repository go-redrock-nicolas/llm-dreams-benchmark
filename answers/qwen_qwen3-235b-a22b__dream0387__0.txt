I am dreaming. It begins in a great hall, so vast its ceiling is shrouded in slow-turning clouds the color of velvet twilight. The floor is glass, and beneath it swirls a sea of lights—neon ribbons folding like ribbon eels in midnight waters. I am standing on the center of a dais, towering above the crowd. I am radiant—dressed in a flowing robe stitched from the reflections of galaxies, each thread a living constellation.

*I know I am extraordinary.*

There is no one else in the room; the crowd is made of reflections, of thousands staring up from the liquid glass. I speak, and each word rings like a bell forged in stars. I speak of my thoughts, my passions, my unique truths. I speak of sacrifice, brilliance, the gods that I have silenced merely by reaching higher than they dared dream.

Then they speak. Not a roar, but a hundred murmurs folding into one dark, omnichoral voice:

> "*You are the sun that scorches the garden instead of warming it.*"  
> "*You gaze so long into your own mirror, its silver begins to tarnish.*"  
> "*You bleed brilliance but forget the world has no hands to catch it.*"

A coldness broods where only heat should dwell.

The crowd of reflections shift, and now they are not just silent observers, but living. They rise up from the liquid glass like wet statues of light, crystalline structures of remembered faces—loved ones, forgotten ones, critics cloaked in poetry and condescension. They do not lionize or laud—they judge. Their eyes shine with something I cannot name, and their judgment whispers not in fire, but in quiet frost.

One steps forward—my mirror, but not mine. It wears my face but smoother, sculpted by others' expectations. This reflection does not echo me—it reflects them. Their version.

> "You think only in a monologue of the soul. You cannot hear the chorus because you compose only your solo."

The moment hangs like a pendulum between heartbeats. I want to argue. To spin celestial logic into proof of my superiority. To tear apart their judgment like golden thread unraveling a shoddy tapestry. But for the first time, I do not speak back.

Instead, I feel.

And it is the most terrifying thing I have ever done.

I close my eyes as my robe begins to dim, the galaxies in the fabric reducing to stars, then embers, then ash. The ceiling lowers. The undersea light begins to go out.

The others speak no more. Only silence now, deep and teeming—like a forest after the final storm.

When I open my eyes again, the hall is gone.

I am in a garden, small and intimate. The flowers are not celestial or mythical—they don’t scream light or spell my name. They are quiet. Resilient. Rooted in ordinary soil, drinking the same sun that falls on every life. Bees pass from bloom to bloom, unnoticed messengers of continuity.

I kneel, uncertain. Reach for the soil. My fingers do not ignite it—my touch does not change it. There is no reward here. Only the deep hum of presence. Of being-in-the-world, not above it.

A single flower looks up at me.

Not worshiping. Not accusing.

Just watching.

In its silence, I sense understanding—for me, for all the silent, aching wars within us.

And I, for the first time, breathe not in defense—but in peace.

This dream ends not with judgment, but synthesis.  
Mirrors do not shatter—they shift.  
The self does not need to be the center to be sacred.  
And the sun that once scorched?  
Perhaps it has only yet to learn:  
The greatest light is shared.
