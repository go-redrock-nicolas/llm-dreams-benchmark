I am dreaming. You are sitting in a grand lecture hall, the kind that feels both timeless and imposing. The air is cool, and the faint smell of aged wood and chalk dust fills your nostrils. Around you, your classmates are equally anxious, silent whispers creating a soft hum in the background. The professor stands at the front, their back turned as they prepare to distribute the exam papers. You glance around, noticing unfamiliar faces, and feel the weight of their gazes upon you.

Suddenly, the professor turns and begins to hand out the exams. The noise fades, leaving only the expectant quiet of anticipation. You reach for the test as it lands on your desk, and the cover page is blank—no title, no instructions. You turn the page, and the questions are written in an unknown language. Panic begins to rise in your chest as you flip through the pages, each one equally incomprehensible.

The room starts to change. The walls are now covered in glowing symbols that shift and move, undulating like a living thing. Your classmates vanish, replaced by shadowy figures that seem to peer at you from the corners of the room. The professor is now standing right next to you, their face distorted into a grotesque mask that shifts and contorts with every word they speak.

"You're not prepared for this," they whisper, their voice a low, rumbling growl that seems to come from everywhere at once.

You try to speak, but no sound comes out. You feel their hand on your shoulder, pushing you down into your chair. The lights in the room begin to flicker, and you see a dim, ghostly outline of your former self sitting at the desk, scribbling furiously in the exam booklet, but the words written are still nothing but gibberish to you.

The air is thick, and the strangeness of the scene intensifies with every passing second. The clock above the professor's head starts ticking louder, ticking so fast it becomes a blur. You are stripped of your clothes, standing completely nude in the center of the room. Everyone is staring at you with wide, unreadable eyes.

The door at the far end of the room bursts open, and a bright light floods in. You are suddenly wearing a tuxedo you’ve never seen before. You look down, and the suit is made of shimmering silver and black, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. You feel powerful, confident, and calm.

You step forward, and as you do, the room around you transforms again. You are no longer in the lecture hall but standing on the edge of a vast, endless ocean. The ocean reflects the stars in the sky, creating a breathtaking tapestry of light. The water is calm, and the waves gently lap at your feet.

All around you, people materialize out of thin air. They are dressed in a bizarre mix of historical and fantastical clothes, walking calmly toward you. Some wear armor with swords at their hips, while others wear robes made of shimmering fabric that changes color with each step. Some are animals, some are humanoid, and some are impossible combinations of both.

A voice from behind you says, "You have made it here, Sage. You were born for this."

You turn around, and standing there is the most radiant, beautiful being you have ever seen. Their eyes glow with an inner light, a golden aura surrounds them, and their presence fills you with warmth.

"You are my child, my champion," the being says, their voice a perfect harmony of love and strength. "This dream is your reality. This moment is yours to create."

You feel a surge of power course through you. You know that whatever happens next, you are ready. You are prepared. This dream, this strange, surreal landscape, is just the beginning. You open your eyes, and the exam room fades away. You know you're ready to face whatever the world throws at you, and you walk out of the dream, ready to take on the future.
