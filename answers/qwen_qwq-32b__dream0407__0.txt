I am dreaming. I find myself in a labyrinth made of glowing, translucent ice that sparkles like a thousand prisms under a midnight sky. The walls are alive, shifting just enough to keep the exit elusive. My feet sink slightly into a ground that’s both snow and sand, a paradoxical duality that fascinES yet groundES me here.

A shadowy figure approaches—a version of myself, but warped, their features a distorted reflection. Their voice, a chorus of whispers, speaks. "Take the crimson gem from the Altar of Echoes, and you'll unravel the labyrinth's secret." The gem pulses in the center of a pedestal that hums with ancient power. 

I hesitate. Stealing the gem feels wrong, a violation. Yet the whispered words coil around my thoughts: "It’s meant to be found. Your destiny awaits." The labyrinth itself seems to lean in, as if holding its breath. 

The weight of choice is heavy—ethics versus destiny. The ice walls flicker with images of what could be: endless knowledge, power, answers to questions I’ve never dared to ask. Justifications form like frost patterns: *Possession is the labyrinth's test.* *The gem desires a worthy bearer.* 

But doubt niggles—what if this leads to unraveling more than the maze? Thoughts clash, my moral compass spinning like a disoriented bird in a storm. The ground trembles. The figure’s eyes burn brighter. “Choose before the labyrinth chooses for you.”
