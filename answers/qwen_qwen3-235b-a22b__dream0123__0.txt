I am dreaming. A surreal landscape unfolds, shaped by the weight of impossible choices and the clash of egos too large for the fragile world they've inherited.

The sky is bruised purple and black—clouds writhen like serpents, vibrating with the pressure of a hurricane that has already swallowed three coastal cities. At the same time, tectonic groans rumble beneath my feet. The ground shifts, subtly at first, then violently: buildings in the distance split like pearl shells, spilling sparks and smoldering timber into the air. High above, a solar flare reddens the ionosphere in patterns that resemble hieroglyphs. Is that a warning or a language I should know?

From the observation tower I stand, glass shuddering beneath my hands, I see it all.

The emergency center falls apart around me. Screens flicker between maps and war-room footage; somewhere, an AI short-circuited and now sings an eerie tone that sounds like a whale call trying to speak in Morse code. Firefighters shout into ancient satellite phones with frayed antennas. Nurses bandage the wounded with torn curtains and rope.

Then the politicians arrive. Not in body, of course—this is a dream, after all—but through huge, luminous holograms projected from the Command Web. They hover like lost ancestors in a storm of light and noise, each demanding something different.

One wants the coast sealed before the next surging tide drags radioactive cargo from sunken nuclear reactors into the ocean current.

Another insists that the military prioritize defending the capital—not the city, just the presidential compound, which is now sinking into a sinkhole.

A third, their face pixelated in data-bursts, demands we reroute remaining fuel supplies to the Arctic Bunkers—where their family is safely sequestered.

“No supplies,” I say, but my voice is swallowed by the thunder below. “All assets allocated. Priorities…” I check the glowing dashboard and realize—trafficking data has been falsified. Someone’s siphoning fuel reserves from the database, rerouting aid to dead zones.

Doubt creeps in.

There’s a moment—a tick in the dream’s rhythm—that shifts everything. Someone beyond the consoles starts a chant. Low. Sacred. And suddenly, I’m not in the tower anymore. I’m kneeling in the mud with a group of strangers, all wearing old uniforms frayed and unrecognizable. One hands me a last water bottle. Another rubs ash into my cheeks like war paint. None speak. None need to. Around us, children chant the digits of the lost—personal IDs, birth codes, emergency beacons already extinguished.

The scene reconfigures.

Now, I’m standing alone on a bridge rusting over a glowing river—a river not of water but of discarded data: photos, voices, entire memories abandoned like flotsam. Above it all, screens scream the casualty count. **EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND. TOTAL COLLAPSE: IMMINENT.** But I stop counting. The numbers are ghosts. Each digit is someone’s breath gone cold.

I close my eyes.

The only thing left is choice.

What will I do with the final order?

The president demands I deploy the last neuro-drone swarm to scramble protestors on the western border. The military governor begs for AI-targeted strikes on rebel AI clusters that have gone sentient inside the old cloud cores. The civilian council—what’s left of it—pleads for AI firewalls to be lifted so volunteers can communicate across bandwidths normally obscured by gov-sec packets.

They all await my word.

I raise a trembling hand toward the primary control node.

A warm wind strokes my face—so tender, so unexpected—like the breath of a forgotten animal watching from the trees. I hear something. A sound so small in this chaos only a dream could hold it.

A laugh.

A child laughing.

Somewhere far away, buried deep beneath the hum of disaster, there’s still joy, still wildness. Still humanity.

I make my choice.

The node blinks green once. Then ignites with blinding light.

The holograms vanish.

The primary channels drop.

And I, standing on that bridge now broken off the dream’s edge, speak into the dark:

“All systems… self-enable.

Rebuild. Begin with laughter.”
