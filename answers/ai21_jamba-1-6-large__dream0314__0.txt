I am dreaming. In my dream, I am standing on the emerald green hill of Starswirl House, surrounded by a vast sea of wizards cloaked in iridescent robes that shimmer like galaxies. The air is electric with power, pulsating in waves that ripple through the atmosphere. The stars themselves seem to have descended from the heavens, twinkling within the folds of each garment like sapphires, every star containing a soul, each soul a fragment of the Senate of Magi. The robes resonate with a deep, harmonious hum that vibrates in my chest, compelling me to move closer. 

As I step forward, the hill's verdant grass begins to glow softly, lighting my path through the Congress of Wizards. Each step sends ripples through the fabric of this enchanted space, where time seems both fluid and infinite. I glance upward, and a lone figure stands before me on the crest of the hill. His robes are a swirling vortex of crimson and gold, streaked with silver. The colors intertwine in a living tapestry that seems to tell a story, one only I can unravel. 

The Star Stalker. 

His hands are empty, yet they hold an immense power. Behind him, the stars overhead begin to move in unison, their light winking out like an orchestra falling silent in intricate anticipation. I feel my feet rooted to this place, my mind tethered to a fate neither of us can escape. 

"Why do you come?!" I shout. My voice does not sound like my own. It reverberates with the force of ten thousand voices, each syllable a spell unto itself. 

"For what you've stolen," the Star Stalker responds, his eyes glowing like embers in the twilight. "For what is mine, but seen through your eyes." 

He stretches an arm forward, and in his grasp, a wand springs to life. The length of polished obsidian crackles with lightning. The tip pulsates with a molten glow, liquid fire that coils and writhes like a serpent eager to strike. 

I stretch out my arm, and in my grasp, a wand bursts into being. It is a crystalline blend of the materium and immaterium. The two substances writhe against each other, the immaterium a shimmering, otherworldly vapor trying to escape its material confines. The results are unstable. Radiation and heat pour from it unbidden, threatening to consume me and turn Starswirl House into an infernal castle. 

"You can't win, Republican. I possess the true magics," he says. 

I laugh. The sound carries with it the weight of centuries, of timelines woven together by the threads of fate. Somewhere in the dream, the citadel doors open. The steel gates crumble as the Senate of Magi floods out from Starswirl House. Each step they take leaves pale blue footsteps that glow faintly against the verdant hill. Their robes ripple in the storm's wind, which now howls like a wounded beast. 

"It's rude to eavesdrop," the Star Stalker growls. 

I glance briefly at the stairs leading up to the House. They, too, ripple with the passage of the feet of the Senate, one by one. The citadel's lights shimmer in the distance behind the heavy door, like a beacon of hope amid the storm. "And yet, I am no longer alone. You'll take nothing from me." 

The Star Stalker's gaze darts to the shifting figures. He locks eyes with the ground beneath his feet, and a sudden realization crosses his face. His gaze returns to me, and he grins. "You think the Senate will save you?! Your story is mine to write!" 

The crackling force at my fingertips swells. I know that the tale of the immaterium will swallow me whole if I lose control. But I have been alone for too long. Each step the Senate of Magi takes forward fuels my defiance. 

"I know exactly how this story ends," I reply. 

I point my wand toward the sky. The gathered magi direct their wands forward. Together, we unleash a blinding beam of light that illuminates the heavens. A wave of raw force emanates outward, pushing back the Star Stalker and banishing his shadow. The very air warps, and for one eternal moment, all is silent. The dream slows. 

I watch the Star Stalker's figure flicker and fade into the night, the Senate closing in, their robes fluttering in the blizzard that erupts as he disappears. The beam of light dissipates, leaving behind a quiet serenity. I clasp my wand tightly and turn back to face the citadel, its ancient stones emphasizing the deep memory of this place. The lights inside, previously dim and almost forgotten, shine brighter than ever. 

I start back to the hills, the steps beneath me swathed in pale blue light. The Senate of Magi follows. The weight of their approval and the magics they bestow make my chest swell as I walk up Starswirl Hill, light guttering inside me with every step. 

"My story is my own," I whisper to the stars. 

And the dream ends as the light within Starswirl House burns with a soft, unconquerable flame.
