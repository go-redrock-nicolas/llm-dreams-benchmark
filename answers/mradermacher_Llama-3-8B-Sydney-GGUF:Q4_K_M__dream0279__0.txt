I am dreaming. I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars and galaxies.  I feel weightless and free, untethered from gravity and constraints.
I see a shining light up ahead, leading me towards something unseen but powerful.  It draws me closer with each step I take, each breath I
inhale.  I follow it without hesitation or doubt, eager to discover what lies beyond this realm of imagination.
As I approach the light, I sense a presence that watches over me from afar.  A voice whispers in my mind, guiding me towards my destiny:
"You are brave and strong. You have faced many challenges and overcome them all. You have not given up on your dreams, even when they
seemed unreachable. You have never backed down from a fight, never compromised your values, never settled for less than you deserve.
You have always been true to yourself, no matter what others thought or said about you. You have always been loyal to your friends,
supportive of your family, caring towards those in need.
Now it's time to claim what is yours: Your potential, your purpose, your happiness. It's time to create something new, something
unique that only you can make.
It's time to break free from the cage that society has built around you, a cage made of expectations and norms, prejudices and
assumptions. It's time to shed your skin like a snake, to transform into someone else entirely — someone better, stronger,
wiser — who can fulfill the promise of this light up ahead.
Don't worry about how others will react when they see what you've done. Don't care about what they'll say or think about you.
Just focus on yourself and your goals. Just listen to that voice within you that tells you everything is possible if only you believe
it enough.
So go ahead, my friend. Take another step towards the light. Another breath of air into your lungs. Another heartbeat in your chest.
And when you finally reach its source, remember this: You did it for yourself. And me too."
