I am dreaming. …feel the beam of your torch sputter like a candle in a gale, and for one unbearable moment the blackness snaps shut around you like a coffin lid.

You are dreaming.

The air is wet enough to taste—iron, stone dust, old water.  Each breath drags across your tongue like rust.  Your free hand skims the catacomb wall, and the chill limestone pulses, as though it has a heartbeat that’s just a half-second out of sync with your own.  Your torch flares once more—an angry, violet-tinged gout of flame—and in that pulse of radiance you glimpse carvings that were never meant for daylight: spirals that unwind into impossible geometries, rows of painted skulls whose grin deepens as the light passes them, and hieroglyphs that rearrange themselves the instant you look away.

Flicker. Darkness returns.  Shapes shuffle at the edge of hearing, like monks in robes made of dry leaves.  You pivot, but your footsteps echo three times, as though other versions of you are stalking the passage just out of phase.

Flicker. Light again.  Ahead, the corridor splits into arches that tilt at crooked angles—one doorway dripping with black moss that glitters like stars, the other framed by jawbones welded into an arch.  In the brief glow you notice your shadow has multiplied: five silhouettes bloom on the walls, each frozen in a different gesture, each slightly delayed, as though time itself is hiccuping.

The torch gutters a third time.  When it reignites, you’re no longer holding it—it floats, a trembling ember suspended before you.  Gravity has forgotten its job.  Pebbles lift from the floor and orbit your ankles.  Weightless, you drift forward, drawn by a low hum—a note forged from the marriage of whale-song and church organ, vibrating in your bones rather than your ears.

There, at the chamber’s heart, stands a subterranean lake as still and black as obsidian.  The water isn’t water; it’s a mirror poured flat.  On its surface lies a boat woven from ribs and silver thread.  A single coin rests on the prow, glowing with lunar frost.  Your reflection in the lake refuses to mimic you—it lifts its hand while yours stays still, its eyes two candleflames that refuse to blink.

Another stutter of darkness.  When vision returns, the reflection is gone, but a figure now waits inside the boat—cloaked in midnight, face concealed behind a mask carved from clear quartz.  Through the crystal you glimpse swirling constellations, tiny galaxies blooming and collapsing in perpetual birth.  The figure extends a hand of shadow-and-starlight toward you.

The catacombs around you sigh.  The carvings whisper like pages turned by an unseen librarian.  You feel the future folding open, as pliable as parchment, and understand—without words—that the lake is not a body of water but a seam between moments: cross it and you may exit the dream inside a memory, a forgotten lifetime, or someone else’s heartbeat.

Your torch sputters its last, surrendering to darkness.  Only the offered hand remains visible, shining with the cold glow of unborn suns.

Do you take it?

The dream holds its breath, waiting for your answer.
