I am dreaming. The door before me is ancient, carved with intricate patterns that seem to shift under my gaze—serpents slither across the wood grain, constellations rearrange themselves, and whispers of forgotten tongues hum in the air as I reach for the handle. It’s warm to the touch, pulsing like a living thing, and as I push it open, a rush of fragrant wind sweeps over me—sweet petrichor, blooming jasmine, and the crisp tang of distant lightning.  

Beyond the door, the world is not just *seen* but *felt*, a living canvas responding to my thoughts. At first, there is only a vast, pearlescent mist, swirling with possibilities—but then I *wish*, and reality bends.  

The ground beneath me softens into velvet moss, glowing faintly with bioluminescent veins of gold. Trees rise in great, twisting pillars, their bark shimmering like polished obsidian, leaves dripping liquid silver. The air hums with invisible currents, carrying voices that aren't quite voices—echoes of laughter, fragments of stories, the birth-cries of unnamed stars.  

I step forward, and with each footfall, the world reshapes. A thought summons a river of liquid light, winding through the trees, its waters thick and slow as honey, humming melodies that resonate in my bones. Another flicker of imagination sends winged creatures spiraling down—they have bodies of stained glass and feathers of molten flame, their eyes holding entire galaxies within.  

A city emerges in the distance, its towers woven from solidified music, staircases spiraling into clouds where dreamers drift in silent rapture. Everywhere, the boundaries blur—fish swim through the air, breathing color; clocks melt into ivy that tells the time in blooming flowers; gravity shifts, inviting me to dance along walls, upside-down and weightless.  

I laugh, and the sound blooms into living fireworks, raining tiny, glowing serpents that curl around my wrists before dissolving into stardust. The dream trembles at my presence, eager to become *more*—an ocean of floating libraries, a desert of singing sands, a palace built from frozen time.  

But then—just for a heartbeat—something stirs in the periphery. A shadow that doesn’t obey my will. A whisper not my own. I turn, pulse quickening, and the dream shudders as if waking.  

And then… I wake.
