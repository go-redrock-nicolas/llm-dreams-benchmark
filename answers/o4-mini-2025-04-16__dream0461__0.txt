I am dreaming. You find yourself drifting through a twilight-hued sky, where the air tastes faintly of star-dust and forgotten melodies. Beneath your feet, clouds ripple like liquid silver, shifting in gentle waves that pulse with hidden colors—indigos that hum, turquoises that sigh, corals that murmur ancient lullabies. With each breath, you become aware of the living symphony around you: the sigh of an unseen wind, the crisp chime of distant bells, the low thrumming heartbeat of the horizon itself.  

At the edge of this cloud-sea, a grand archway of woven light beckons. You step through and suddenly stand in a forest of crystalline trees whose branches unfurl in fractal patterns, each leaf reflecting an entire galaxy. When you brush your fingers against their bark, it shivers and reveals miniature constellations hidden just beneath the surface. A gentle warmth spreads up your arm—like gratitude made tangible—reminding you of every kindness you once overlooked.  

Eager, you follow a trail of luminescent petals that float on an invisible current. They guide you into a vast cavern where pools of liquid glow ripple in sync with your thoughts. As you peer into one, you see images of your childhood laughter, the first time you tasted sunlight on your tongue, the quiet peace of simply closing your eyes. You realize these moments were never trivial—they were secret seeds of wonder you’d allowed to wither.  

You kneel and cup the liquid in your hands. It shimmers, transforming into a dove of living prism-light, which flutters into your chest and unfolds within, filling you with the fierce clarity of being fully alive. With this newfound spark, you rise and ascend a spiral staircase carved from moonbeams. Step by step, you feel gravity relax its grip on your heart, and at the summit you emerge onto a soaring balcony overlooking all of existence—planets drifting like lanterns, nebulae blooming in slow motion, the pulse of life vibrating in every particle of space.  

Here, curiosity shines like a beacon. You stretch out your hands and the cosmos responds, weaving new worlds between your fingertips, reminding you that wonder is not a gift granted only once but a living journey you can rekindle with every breath—both in dreams and in waking life.
