I am dreaming. The air hums with unseen currents as I stand upon a floating island of polished obsidian, suspended in an endless indigo sky speckled with constellations shaped like watching eyes. The island pulses beneath my bare feet—a living thing, breathing through veins of molten silver that spiderweb across its glassy surface.  

Before me stretches an amphitheater carved from the ribs of some cosmic leviathan, its curved bones threaded with phosphorescent moss. The audience is not human. Their forms shift like liquid smoke—sometimes resembling scholars in tattered robes, other times coiling into shapes with too many limbs, their faces fracturing like broken mirrors to reflect my deepest insecurities back at me. They hiss and chitter in a language of snapping embers.  

I must argue that hunger is holy. That starvation purifies the soul.  

My stomach knots—I who have always believed in abundance, in the sacredness of feast and nourishment. But the dream demands heresy. So I open my mouth, and my words emerge as spirals of black honey, slow and thick.  

"Consider the clarity of emptiness," I whisper, and the amphitheater trembles. "A body hollowed by want becomes a flute for the wind's song." The smoke-forms ripple, some elongating into needles of disapproval. A being with antlers of frozen ink leans forward, its voice the sound of a glacier cracking: *"You fed the beggars at your city's gates just yesterday. Explain this hypocrisy."*  

I lift a hand—my fingers are translucent, revealing galaxies swirling beneath the skin. "What is more generous than to offer someone the dignity of their own desolation? To let them touch the divine through absence?" The words taste like ashes, but the dream shapes them into truth. A truth I do not believe, yet must wield like a flaming sword.  

One entity detaches from the rest, taking the form of my childhood friend, their eyes full of dying stars. "Then let *us* feast," they murmur, and the crowd parts to reveal a banquet table piled high with glistening fruits—each one pulsing with a heartbeat. The test is clear: Prove my conviction by refusing sustenance.  

**What do I do?**
