I am dreaming. As I step onto the gleaming marble stage, the vast auditorium before me transforms in surreal waves. The audience members' faces ripple like reflections in a disturbed pond, their features melting and reforming in hypnotic patterns. The ceiling seems impossibly high, stretching upward into swirling cosmic nebulae that pulse with ethereal colors I've never seen before.

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, butterflies of pure light flutter forth, each one carrying fragments of my thoughts on their luminescent wings. The crowd gasps in unified wonder, their breath creating a wind that lifts me gently off my feet. I float suspended, watching as my business suit transforms into flowing robes made of living starlight.

The theater seats begin to sprout flowers that climb toward me like eager children reaching for a parent. Their petals chime like tiny bells, creating a symphony that somehow translates my intended speech into pure emotion. The audience members begin to glow from within, their bodies becoming translucent like human-shaped prisms, refracting rainbow light throughout the space.

Suddenly, I realize the back wall of the auditorium has disappeared, opening into an endless ocean where whales made of constellation patterns swim through space-time. Their songs weave perfectly with the flower-chimes, and I understand that this is the most important presentation of my life, though I can't remember what I'm supposed to be talking about.

The butterflies returning to me, landing on my skin and sinking into my flesh like shimmering tattoos. As they dissolve, I feel knowledge flowing through my veins like liquid wisdom, and I know that everyone in the audience is actually me at different ages, waiting to hear what I've learned from all of our collective experiences...

The dream continues to spiral into ever more magnificent impossibilities, each moment more real than reality itself.
