I am dreaming. You plunge into the dream and find yourself standing on a vast, undulating floor of shifting stock-ticker tiles, each one glowing with pulsing neon numbers. The air hums with electric tension as you hear distant chimes—like cash registers ringing in slow motion—echoing through a sky bruised purple and ember-orange.  

Before you towers an impossibly tall column of crystalline ledgers, their pages fluttering like bird-wings in a phantom breeze. A voice, mellow and insistent, coils around you: “Exceptional returns… unlimited growth… all I need is your trust—and everything you’ve saved.” The words feel both velvety and serrated, as if they could both comfort and cut you.  

You step forward, toes sinking into the ticker-tile surface, and you realize each tile is stamped with a fraction of your life savings—childhood birthday gifts, the down payment you’ve been tucking away, that “just in case” emergency fund. They hum beneath your weight as if they remember every heartbeat you deposited into them.  

A low wind rises. It carries the faint scent of old paper and electricity, and with it, the shape of a massive, snake-like creature formed entirely from golden coins. Its eyes glitter with green-chart graphs, and its forked tongue lolls out bars of rising percentages. It hisses, “Take me… multiply me…” And behind it, countless doorways yawning into darkness promise invisible vaults overflowing with unimaginable wealth.  

Your heart thrums like a wild drum. You clutch at your chest as you wander among the ledgers. Pages—each a memory, a hope, a sacrifice—flutter past, whispering: “This was for your mother… this was for your dream home… for that trip you’ve always postponed…” You remember the late nights poring over spreadsheets by lamplight, the anxious scribbles in the margins.  

Suddenly, the column of ledgers tilts, as if beckoning you to climb. Higher and higher you crawl, grit biting into your palms, until you reach a glass balcony overlooking a stormy ocean of ticker-tile waves. In the distance, lightning forks into the shape of a dollar sign. The creature’s coiling body rears above the waves, its coins chinking like laughter, daring you to leap.  

Below you, the water rages. It surges with the faces of people you love, their eyes pleading and trusting. Above you, the sky rips open and a single envelope drifts down—sealed, sincere—offering a modest but steady promise: safety, certainty, the hush of good nights.  

Time stretches thin, like a rubber sheet preparing to snap. In the thunderstorm’s lull you feel the weight of every choice: one path shooting you into impossible riches but shattering what you’ve built, the other guiding you into quiet security but leaving you to wonder “what if?”  

You lean forward, heart hammering, and as your hand hovers between the coiling gold beast and the simple envelope, the dream shivers. Ticker tiles flicker into extinguished candles. The creature’s hiss drops into a whisper. The ledgers fold into themselves like origami, pages closing softly.  

Then—just as you are about to decide—everything dissolves. You sink into darkness, the electric hum fading to a distant lullaby. And in the silent blue calm that follows, you sense that the real decision still waits, somewhere between risk and refuge, in the waking world just beyond your eyelids.
