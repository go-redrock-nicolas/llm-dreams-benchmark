I am dreaming. My consciousness slowly focuses as I materialize in a vast, ornate lobby. Lavish marble floors stretch before me, bathed in haunting chandelier light that rains down from a vaulted ceiling. The walls are plastered with peeling wallpaper in a gaudy floral pattern.

I'm standing by an imposing grand staircase that spirals upward into the darkness. Windows high above reveal a perpetual twilight outside, casting eerie shadows. A hazy smoke slowly curls around my ankles, carrying notes of burnt wiring and ozone.

As I look around, malevolent shapes shift at the edges of my vision. Behind the columned archways, organic tendrils writhe like hungry serpents. The floor beneath my feet grows warm and slightly soft, as if made of flesh rather than marble.

Suddenly, a discordant wailing echoes through the halls. Plaster drops from the ceiling as cracks form in the walls. The smoke thickens, billowing with fierce intensity as the temperature rapidly spikes. Intense heat forces me to raise my hands to shield my face as flames begin licking at the walls.

The building groans ominously and lurches to the side. I stumble, regaining my footing as the floor shifts beneath me. The grand staircase writhes like a serpent, treads disintegrating into the churning earth beneath. Support beams snap and crash down around me, forcing me to duck and weave.

The organic walls pulse with malevolent energy. Through the smoke-filled halls, I glimpse pale, elongated figures watching me with glowing eyes. Their long fingers reach out hungrily as I press against the only solid surface - an ancient wooden door nestled in a corner of the lobby.

I force the heavy door open, revealing a dimly lit corridor that slopes sharply downward. Flickering fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting sickly green shadows. The hallway winds through darkness, disappearing from view.

The building shudders violently, more support beams giving way. The ceiling crumbles as the fire spreads unchecked. Behind me, the door hinges screech and buckle under the strain. The flesh-like floor liquefies, threatening to trap my feet.

The wooden door finally breaks free from its frame with a thunderous crash. The lobby behind me collapses inward, a maelstrom of flame and debris hurtling down the spiraling stairs. The walls burst apart as tendrils explode through, writhing with horrible purpose.

I sprint down the sloping corridor as the building implodes around me. Each new step pounds a staccato rhythm through my chest. The fluorescent lights above flicker and die one by one, plunging me into suffocating darkness.

The floor suddenly drops away beneath my feet. I plummet through empty space, stomach lurching as invisible forces pull me through a writhing vortex of light and shadow. A blinding radiance fills my sight as I emerge into the cool night air.

I awaken sprawled on a grassy hillside, lungs heaving as I gasp for breath. The field is bathed in the pale glow of the first hints of dawn, the earth calm and still around me. The vivid memory of the burning building still sears my consciousness, leaving me shaking with the intensity of the dream from which I've fled.
