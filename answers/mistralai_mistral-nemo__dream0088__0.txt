I am dreaming. In this dream, you find yourself not in the familiar office setting, but rather standing on the surface of a vibrant, swirling galaxy. The stars are not distant points of light, but living, breathing entities, their colors shifting and blending like a painter's pallette under the night sky. You're standing on a bridge of pure, iridescent energy that slices through the cosmos, connecting two celestial bodies. One is a lush, technicolor planet buzzing with life and activity, the other a dormant, monochrome moon, its surface awaiting the first footprints of discovery.

Suddenly, a horde of tiny, metallic creatures, resembling$idleEhults with long, antennae-like appendages and glowing digital eyes, swarm around you. They're demanding your attention, each chirping out a different, urgent task. Some are programming sequences that light up the air like neon hieroglyphics, others are drafting architectural designs for interstellar skyscrapers, while a few are furiously waving around tiny, pulsating data crystals. You're trying to keep up, but they're swarming too fast, and the weight of their expectations presses down on you like a physical force.

Then, from the colorless moon, a towering figure emerges - your boss, but not as you've ever seen them before. They're a colossus, their form made of shimmering starlight, their voice a symphony of nebulas. "More projects, more progress, more potential!" they boom, unleashing a barrage of pulsating, ethereal holograms. Each one appears to be a new, critical endeavor, each more vital and urgent than the last. You try to reach for them, but your hands pass through, leaving you grasping at the cold void of space.

You turn to the planet, seeking solace in familiarity. But it's not the bustling metropolis you expected. It's a vast, quiet garden, its foliage made of electrons andvice versa. At its center, a serene tree with metallic bark and branches That sway gracefully in the cosmic winds. Its leaves whisper ancient codes, its roots pull up data from the depths of the void. You feel drawn to it, your heart aching to connect with something real, something tangible.

Feeling overwhelmed, you collapse to your knees, the weight of the countless tasks crushing you. But as you fall, you reach out towards the distant tree. Just before you hit the bridge, you wake up.
