I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the entrance of a grand Victorian mansion, its weathered wooden doors towering before me like ancient sentinels. My heart pounds with such force I can feel it in my fingertips, each beat sending tiny electric jolts through my nervous system. The approaching social gathering swirls in my mind like a tempest.

As I reach for the brass doorknob, it transforms into liquid gold, running through my fingers and pooling at my feet. The anxiety morphs the world around me – the mansion's windows begin to breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs, their glass panes rippling like disturbed water. I can see silhouettes of people inside, their forms distorted and elongated, moving in ways that defy human anatomy.

My feet begin to sink into the porch, which has become soft like marshmallow. Each step I take creates echoes that sound like distant laughter, mocking and familiar yet strange. The walls of the mansion start to bleed dark blue paint that runs upward instead of down, defying gravity, forming patterns that look like judging eyes.

The party guests I'm dreading to meet appear in the windows, but their faces keep shifting – one moment they're wearing venetian masks, the next they're familiar faces from my childhood, then they're abstract swirls of color with questioning expressions. Their voices seep through the walls like smoke, speaking words in reverse that somehow I understand perfectly.

The anxiety builds to a crescendo as the mansion begins to fold in on itself like origami, each crease revealing a new layer of social expectations and unspoken rules I feel compelled to follow but can't quite grasp. The sky above turns to stained glass, fragmenting the light into a thousand different colors that each represent a different way I could potentially embarrass myself at this gathering.

Just as the pressure becomes unbearable, the entire scene begins to melt like a watercolor painting in the rain, the colors running together into a swirling vortex of social anxiety and surreal architecture, pulling me deeper into the dream's abstract interpretation of my fears...
