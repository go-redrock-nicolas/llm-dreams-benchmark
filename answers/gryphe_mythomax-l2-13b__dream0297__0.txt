I am dreaming. I float through a crowd, feeling their eyes on me as I approach. A smile erupts on my face, and I greet them warmly. Their laughter rings out around me, their eyes sparkling with delight. As we chat, I sense no genuine connection to them, but I can't help but feel a thrill from the power I have over them.

Moving from person to person, I weave a web of intrigue and excitement. My words are nimble, my gestures grand, and before long, I've convinced everyone of my trustworthiness. They confide in me their deepest secrets, unaware of the emptiness within me.

My heart beats wildly, not from joy or emotion but from the rush of control I wield. The dream fades into darkness, and I am left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction. As the last echoes of their laughter die away, I am reminded that this dreamworld is no substitute for genuine human connection and authenticity.
