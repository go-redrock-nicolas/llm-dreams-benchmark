I am dreaming. You drift into the dream fully, as though your own mind has folded inward and become the stage for a grand pageant of rank and ritual. All around you, gleaming pillars of opalescent stone rise toward a liquid-gold sky. Every surface is etched with swirling sigils that glow softly, responding to the presence of each soul who passes. You feel the pulse of unspoken etiquette in the air—an invisible current that seems to sort everyone by subtle hues: a violet afterglow for the highborn, a warm amber for the middling, and a delicate cerulean swirl for those still finding their footing.  

As you walk the broad marble terraces, you notice that people’s voices don’t simply carry words but also weave colored ribbons that drift from lips to ears. A single misplaced word can tangle another’s ribbon into knots, drawing sharp gasps or polite winces. Every glance, too, is framed by tiny filigreed halos that hover above each forehead—some shining like rising suns, others dimming like spent candles, each halo the silent proof of status, favor, or disgrace.  

You swiftly memorize the unspoken dances of bows and glances. When you meet a chamberlain in vermilion robes, you incline your head at precisely forty-five degrees, eyes lowered just long enough for respect but high enough to show confidence. When a councilor in pale jade passes, you cross your arms in the emblematic gesture of solidarity, your fingertips brushing the small amulets pinned to your cloak. All the while, you feel the hive-mind of the society, each person anticipating and approving—or sometimes, just barely tolerating—your next move.  

Then, in an instant, the harmony shudders. In a hallway lined with living mirrors—each reflecting not only your face but the quiet judgments of unseen onlookers—you speak a casual jest about the ruling caste’s legendary winged mantises. The laugh you intended as harmless flies out rough and jagged. The room tenses. The mirrors’ surfaces ripple.  

You have committed a major social transgression.  

Immediately, the filigreed halos above the eyes of every attendant flare bright white—then shatter inward, sending fractal sparks into the air. The sound is like distant bells cracking. The amber glow of your own aura sputters and dims to ashen gray. The crowd’s ribbons of speech retract like quicksilver, leaving a sudden hush. No one dares approach you.  

In that moment, you feel your body shift. Your feet sink a fraction of an inch into the marble floor. Your shoulders hunch as though gravity itself has become heavier upon you. You try to raise your chin but find your own head weighted, as if laced with lead. A cold voice echoes through the vast hall—neither male nor female, yet composed of every voice you’ve ever known—announcing your censure.  

A circle of silver-robed wardens forms around you. Each warden bears an orb of flickering starlight that projects scenes of your transgression onto the walls: the jest, the halting laugh, the collective recoil. With solemn precision, they begin to intone the Ritual of Erasure. You watch as your name—woven into banners and tablets throughout the city—glows for an eternal heartbeat, then dissolves into a soft, mournful spark.  

As they chant, you feel your memories of protocol slip away. The elegant gestures you once performed without thought become vague abstractions. The steps you once knew by heart of that intricate greeting dance now escape you. Panic swells, but it is distant, like a glass bell tolling far away.  

Then, abruptly, it all stops. The silver-robed wardens lower their heads and press their orbs together. In a single flash of moonlight, your aura flickers back to life—but it is neither violet, amber, nor cerulean. It is a new, iridescent hue, shifting constantly through every color you’ve ever seen. The mirrors around you ripple once more, and you glimpse your reflection: a figure not cast out but reborn, standing alone in a society that has reordered itself.  

You realize that in losing the old status you carried so naturally, you have gained something rarer—an unpredictable spark that cannot be slotted into any hierarchy. The dream’s golden sky ripples like liquid metal, and you step forward into that unknown freedom, your every heartbeat echoing with possibility.
