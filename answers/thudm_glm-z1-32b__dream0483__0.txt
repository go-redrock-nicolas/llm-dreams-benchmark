I am dreaming. I am aware of how my expectations shape my experience, and how clinging to them can lead to suffering. Through practice, I have learned to let go, to flow with reality. In this dream, I find myself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean. The water is not blue but a deep, iridescent purple, glowing with bioluminescent plankton that dance like living constellations. Above me, the sky is a swirling tapestry of soft lavender and peach, streaked with silver cirrus clouds that shift and reform like liquid thoughts. 

My feet are bare on the warm, smooth sand, which feels like crushed velvet underfoot. The air is thick with the scent of something sweet and tangy, like ripe mangoes mingled with salt. Off in the distance, a lone tree stands, its branches reaching up like a giant's hand. The leaves are emerald green but have a translucent quality, as though they're made of stained glass. From the tree's trunk springs a ribbon of liquid light that arcs into the sky, forming a bridge to a cluster of floating islands. Each island is a different shape—a perfect sphere, a jagged crescent, a spiral that unwinds like a galaxy. 

As I approach the tree, a figure appears—a silver-haired woman with skin like polished obsidian. She wears a gown of swirling galaxies, and her eyes are twin moons against the indigo of her pupils. "You've come to understand," she says in a voice that ripples like wind through bamboo. "To embrace your dream, you must cross the bridge made of your own expectations. But remember: the bridge is not solid. It shifts with your attention." 

I step onto the bridge, which is made of translucent, glowing threads that spiral and coil. With each step, the path beneath me changes color and texture—sometimes a shimmering mirror of the ocean, sometimes a rippling desert of gold sand. I let go of my desire for a "correct" path and simply follow the threads, my heart open to the uncertainty. 

On the floating islands, I encounter strange creatures—a flock of birds with feathers that change hue based on the emotions of those nearby, a herd of deer with antlers made of glass that catch and refract the light. They welcome me with nods and gestures, their actions free of judgment. On the spiral island, I find a pool of liquid time. Each drop holds a memory, but instead of being fixed, they swirl and mix, showing me different possibilities—me laughing with a friend, me meditating under a different tree, me simply sitting and appreciating the sunset. 

I choose to dip my hand into the pool, and instead of a single memory, I experience a chorus of moments—a flowing collage of sensations and emotions. This is my reality, and it's ever-changing. The pressure to hold onto any one moment dissolves. 

Leaving the islands, I return to the shore. The ocean waves now lap gently at my feet, and the sky is peach and rose. The woman from the tree smiles. "You see now," she says. "Your expectations were the walls. By releasing them, you become the artist of your experience." 

The dream fades, but I wake up with a sense of peace, knowing that my reality is what I make it, moment to moment, without attachment.
