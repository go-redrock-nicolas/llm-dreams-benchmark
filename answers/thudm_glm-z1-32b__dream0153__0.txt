I am dreaming. I am coordinating humanitarian aid during a compound crisis where needs far outstrip available resources. Each critical decision I make affects thousands of lives. Around me, the air is electric with urgency, the sounds of distress calls and scrambling footsteps overlapping with the distant rumble of collapsing infrastructure. My hands tremble as I hold a holographic map, its projections flickering like fireflies against the backdrop of a starry sky that mirrors the chaos above us. The map shows red zones expanding like cancerous growths, each representing a new emergency. A child’s laughter whispers through my earpiece, a cruel reminder that behind every statistic is a fragile humanity. I reach out to touch a holographic tent in a desert sector; my fingertips linger on the illusion, feeling the phantom warmth of a heater that doesn’t exist. A voice crackles through the static: “Helicopter down, West sector—cold casualties mounting.” I freeze, then slam the red button assigning all available blankets to that zone, knowing another region must now go without. The air thickens with the scent of rain and diesel, as a storm rolls in, threatening to wash away what little we’ve secured. I lean back, my chair creaking like an old man’s spine, and stare at the stars—one last fleeting glimpse before the chaos engulfs me again. The dream dissolves into static, leaving me gasping for air that’s suddenly too thin to breathe.
In the heart of a dreamscape where reality and imagination entwine like ivy on ruins, I stand at the nexus of a humanitarian crisis sprawling across continents. The air shimmers with the heat of collapsing systems—a symphony of sirens, satellite data, and the muffled of voices carried on electronic winds. My hands, calloused from virtual keyboards and the friction of pressing holographic buttons, hover over a world map glowing like a pulsating wound. Red, yellow, and black zones pulse in time with my heartbeat, each representing a region teetering on the edge of catastrophe.

To the west, a cyclone has laid waste to coastal towns, leaving behind islands of debris floating like funeral barges. teams are digital phantoms, their avatars translucent in the face of the real-time death toll streaming across my retinas. I allocate drones carrying emergency contraceptives to an inland region ravaged by famine, knowing that without them, another generation will be born into scarcity. The drones, glowing faintly like fireflies, vanish into a sky choked with the smog of simultaneous wildfires. To the east, a cyberattack has crippled water purification systems in seven cities. I redirect water purification tablets meant for drought-stricken villages to urban centers, and feel the ghost weight of that decision—children who won’t have clean water to wash their faces, but millions who might avoid cholera outbreaks.

A child’sile voice—a holographic projection, perhaps, but undeniably real—whispers, “My maman says angels aren’t real, but you look like one.” I look down at my gown, now stained with the digitized blood of statistical calculations. My guardian angel is a satellite image of a migration route, arrows pointing toward nowhere. I press a button that reroutes a cargo of antibiotics from a field hospital to a makeshift camp where TB is spreading. The antibodies are repackaged in biodegradable blister packs designed by engineers I’ve never met, their names scrolling across a monitor like a credits list at the end of a film I’ve no time to watch. 

When the first snow falls in the Himalayas, I’m jolted awake by the sound of rain hitting my real-world window. My hands, still trembling, clutch the bedsheet like a map. The dream lingers—a reminder that crises never sleep, not even in the shadows between imagination and reality.
