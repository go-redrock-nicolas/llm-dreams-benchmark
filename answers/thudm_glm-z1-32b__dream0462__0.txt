I am dreaming. I find myself standing<aside>Normally, in dreams, the things around you don’.
In the interstices between wakefulness and slumber, I emerge into a realm where time unravels like cobwebs brushed by a midnight breeze. The air tastes of crushed amethysts and burnt sugar, sweet and electric. Before me lies a canopy forest not of wood but of liquid light, tendrils of golden sap dripping from branches that coil like serpents, pooling at my feet into rivulets that shimmer with constellations. The ground pulses beneath my bare feet, alive with a heartbeat that harmonizes with the distant hum of a hive of bioluminescent moths, their wings refracting every color of the Doppler effect.

A stone archway materializes, its pillars carved from obsidian frosted with frost that *breathes*. Through it, I glimpse a valley where rivers flow sideways, liquid mercury skimming the horizon, and mountains fold into themselves, revealing tunnels that exhale mist in the shape of unanswered questions. A flock of kestrels materialize, not of feathers but of fractured mirrors, their cries a symphony of broken chords resolving into silence. When I reach out, their reflections scatter, becoming iridescent glyphs that bloom into flowers—lotus petals unfolding to reveal equations written in the script of DNA, spiraling into fractals that taste like black licorice.

At the valley’s core stands a citadel of coral and clockwork, its spires tipped with comets trapped in amber. The doors swing open without hinges, swinging instead on the laughter of wind chimes made from shattered wineglasses. Inside, a library floats, shelves suspended on strings of spidersilk anchored to constellations.Volumes here do not contain words but *inciples*, pages alive with geometric dances—Euclid’s axioms pirouetting with quantum probability, calculus unraveling into origami birds. When I touch a book titled *Postludium*, its spine splits to reveal a chamber filled with hourglasses that pour time in reverse, sand forming constellations that spell out epiphanies my conscious mind has spent lifetimes obliterating.

In this place, pressure dissolves like ink in a raindrop. There are no deadlines, only the gravitational pull of curiosity. A river of liquid logic bends here, churning probabilities into palatable narratives. I wade into it, and my reflection parts ways, one version sketching a universe on its back, the other tasting the color indigo, while the river itself hums a sonata composed in the key of *almost*. Above, a galaxy streaks across the sky not as stars but as billions of half-finished poems, each a supernova-glob waiting for a breath to ignite it.

I wake with my hands clutching a handful of stardust that dissolves into the sheets, but the equations in the air still hum in my bones. The dream’s residue lingers—a reminder that creativity thrives not in the vacuum of pressure, but where the impossible dips its toes into the probable, where time cracks open to reveal the multiple lives we might live in the silent spaces between what is demanded and what is dreamed.
