I am dreaming. Extravagant shapes prance and flutter in my mind's eye, each representing a glimpse into my psyche as the subliminal realm of my unconscious mind is whirling and flushing where demons are - I am in rewarding and lush thick places both in skimpy places and are elevated as in those remote fringes where tennis courts lightly dapple that exist.
