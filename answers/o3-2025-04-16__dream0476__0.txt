I am dreaming. …find yourself standing ankle-deep in midnight-blue water that ripples beneath an onyx sky. Moon-pale lilies drift around you like small, glowing lanterns, inhaling and exhaling with the tide as though the entire sea is breathing. Each time you blink, the world reshapes itself: towers rise from the waves, dissolve into nebulae, and rain down as silvery dust that beads upon your skin like stars clinging to a planet.

The emotion you have fled—an old, unnamed dread—hovers just beyond the edge of perception, like thunder muffled behind a distant ridge. It has always been there, watching from behind lace curtains of forgetfulness. Tonight, the dream insists you turn toward it.

You inhale, and the lilies drift aside, revealing a spiral stair carved from translucent quartz descending into the sea. The steps glimmer with trapped starlight. You begin to walk down. Each footfall sounds like a bell struck underwater: low, resonant, undeniable. With every step the ocean transforms into air, and the stairwell becomes a glistening throat that swallows you gently yet irrevocably.

At the bottom, you emerge in a grand subterranean greenhouse. Vines of copper and emerald coil around crystal trellises; fireflies the size of snowflakes drift lazily, exhaling sparks that pirouette into the humid gloom. All is beautiful, yet every leaf quivers, tense, as if the entire garden waits for a storm that never arrives.

In the center stands a glass coffin filled with swirling gray smoke. The inscription reads:

“Here lies the Feeling You Banished.”

Your pulse flickers. You realize the smoke is not inert; it is breathing. It pulses with your own heartbeat, mirroring the rhythm you keep even in sleep. Though the coffin is sealed, the dread within is alive, aching for recognition.

You place your palms on the cool glass. Immediately the garden darkens; vines tense like drawn bowstrings; crystals hum with static. You feel an instinct to retreat—but instead you whisper, “I am here. Speak.”

The coffin dissolves into mist, releasing a wind that smells of petrichor and attic shadows. The smoke spills forward, twisting into a figure shaped like you but hollow, its chest a cavern whose walls are lined with jagged mirrors. In every pane you glimpse memories you avoided: a childhood humiliation, a moment you betrayed yourself, a grief you refused to cry, nights when loneliness gnawed like winter rats. The figure raises its mirror-hands, offering them to you.

Terror surges—a hot current racing from your stomach to your throat. Yet you do not run. You kneel, open your arms, and allow the mirror-figure to step inside you. It sinks through your skin like rain absorbed by parched earth. Pain blooms—sharp, crystalline—but it is clean, not poisonous. Your ribs expand as though making room for a long-lost twin. You feel yourself growing heavier and lighter at once, grounded by gravity yet buoyed by a sudden inner spaciousness.

When you stand, your reflection in every mirrored leaf shows a single, whole being: eyes bright, breathing steady, shoulders no longer braced against invisible blows.

The greenhouse unfurls its tension. Vines blossom into incandescent flowers that chime like tiny bells. The firefly-snowflakes drift upward, forming constellations that sketch unfamiliar yet benevolent stories across the vaulted dark. A warm rain begins—petals, not water—each petal whispering thank-you as it lands. You realize the dread was never your enemy; it was merely a child left alone in a locked room, waiting for someone to gather it up and say, “You may come home now.”

With acceptance pulsing through your veins, the dream lifts you toward the opening sky. The quartz stair re-forms beneath your feet, carrying you upward through water that has become light. You break the surface into dawn. The lilies applaud with their petals. Far out on the horizon, a single, magnificent wave rises, catches the newborn sun, and scatters it across the sea like gold coins flung to herald your return.

You awaken, heart steady, tears clean as spring rain. The once-threatening emotion now rests in your chest like a quiet lantern—warm, illuminating, wholly yours.
