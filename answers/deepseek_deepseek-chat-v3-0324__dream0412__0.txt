I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an immense, undulating meadow that stretches as far as the horizon, where the sky melts into molten gold. The air hums softly—not with sound, but with the faint electric pulse of unseen energy, as though the very atmosphere is alive and whispering secrets to the rustling blades of grass beneath my feet. Each step I take sends ripples through the meadow, not just through the vegetation, but through reality itself, warping the colors around me into fleeting kaleidoscopic patterns.

Ahead, a vast tree rises from the earth, its trunk shimmering like polished obsidian, yet somehow translucent—a dark mirror reflecting a thousand fractured versions of myself in its surface. The branches twist upward into the sky, each one branching into finer and finer filaments until they dissolve into threads of stardust. Tiny luminescent fruits dangle from the limbs, pulsing gently in hues of deep violet and cerulean, their light casting shifting shadows that dance with a life of their own.

As I approach, the tree’s bark shudders—not with wind, but with something deeper, rhythmic, almost like breath. A low, resonant tone reverberates through the ground, matching the rhythm of my own heartbeat. The sound grows until I realize it isn’t just noise—it’s a language, ancient and wordless, vibrating through my bones. The fruits begin to glow brighter, synchronizing with the rhythm, and I notice each one contains a flickering scene inside: glimpses of memories I’ve forgotten, futures not yet lived, landscapes from worlds that don’t exist. 

One fruit detaches and floats toward me, hovering just beyond my reach. The scene inside shifts—I see myself, but not as I am now. This version of me stands on a bridge suspended over an abyss of swirling galaxies, speaking to a being woven from smoke and constellations. The vision fractures as the fruit drifts closer, and now I hear whispers, layers of voices overlapping—some my own, some unfamiliar, all speaking at once:

*"You are the question and the answer."*  
*"The door is open, but you must step through."*  
*"Look deeper—beneath the surface of the dream."*  

I reach out, and the moment my fingers brush the fruit’s luminous skin, the entire meadow implodes into a rush of light and sound—not a collapse, but a transformation. Suddenly, I’m no longer standing. I’m everywhere and nowhere at once, a scattered consciousness adrift in a sea of fractured time. The tree, the meadow, the sky—they’re all still here, but also inside me, part of me. 

Then, just as suddenly, I *remember*: this isn’t the first time I’ve been here. The dream loops endlessly, each iteration revealing another layer, another secret. And the tree—it isn’t just a tree. It’s waiting. It’s *watching*.  
And then—  
I wake.  

...Or do I?
