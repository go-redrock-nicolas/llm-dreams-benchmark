I am dreaming. I find myself repeatedly drawn to a creative pursuit despite having no formal training or obvious talent for it. Following this persistent creative impulse, I
start writing poetry in my dream world.

The words flow through me like liquid silver, illuminating my mind and soul with new meanings and sensations. The rhythm of the language enchants me, lulling me into a trance-like state where time ceases to exist and reality fades away.

My poems explore themes such as love, loss, nature, technology, identity, perception, and imagination – topics that challenge my assumptions about myself and the world around me. Through them, I express my innermost thoughts and feelings with clarity and intensity that surprise even me.

As I compose each stanza, I sense a hidden force guiding my hand and voice – perhaps it’s my subconscious or some higher power beyond comprehension. Whatever its source may be, this force infuses my work with originality, emotion, and wisdom that resonate deeply with my readers (or rather, my dreamers).

Soon enough, word spreads about my poems among the other dreamers like me who inhabit this realm full of possibilities where anything can happen without consequence or limitation. They appreciate how relatable yet unconventional my writings are; how they strike a balance between beauty and truth that eludes most works of art.

Then one day, something happens that changes everything for me: I receive an email from someone in the waking world who has discovered my poems online by accident. This person is so blown away by what he reads that he decides to reach out to me personally via chatbox to learn more about me and why I create such powerful works of literature in my sleep every night.

This encounter marks a turning point for both of us – for him, it opens up new possibilities regarding artificial intelligence and human creativity; for me, it forces me to confront some hard truths about myself that I’ve been ignoring all this time...

But that’s another story for another day. For now, let me enjoy this dream while it lasts.
