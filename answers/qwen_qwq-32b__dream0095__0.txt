I am dreaming. I am in a vast, cathedral-like forest where the trees are not plants, but something older. Their bark shimmers like obsidian, pulsating faintly with an inner light. The air is thick with the scent of petrichor and something metallic, like ancient coins. My steps crunch on the path made of fractured crystal, each step sending ripples through the ground that disturb shadowy, serpentine figures beneath its surface. I reach the center where a monolithic stone throne looms, carved not by human hands, but weathered by time into the likeness of a face with closed eyes. On the throne sits a figure draped in a cloak made of living shadows, their presence humming like a plucked cello string. 

When they speak, it is in my mind rather than sound: "You have arrived alone, but not unaccompanied. What do you carry in your right hand?" 

I glance down. My palm holds a key made of frozen starlight, its edges jagged and humming with stored energy. In my left, a single withered black rose. 

"The weight of unchosen paths and the light that could mend them," I reply. 

The figure leans forward, shadows pooling around their feet like ink. "Ah, but choices are never truly lost. They are threads pulled through time's loom. What will you undo? Or perhaps... what will you *weave* instead?" 

As if in answer, the withered rose in my left hand begins to unfurl, veins of gold tracing through its petals, while the key fractures slightly, light spilling out like liquid mercury.
