I am dreaming. I'm standing on a stage bathed in blue-violet light, my heart pounding against my ribs like a desperate fist. The international glass-sculpting championship—the final round. My competitors flank me on either side, masters from Venice and Tokyo, their hands steady as stone, their tools arrayed before them like surgical instruments. Mine are mismatched, some borrowed, some crafted from repurposed kitchen implements.

The crowd is a sea of expectant faces, blurring together except for my grandfather in the front row—the man who taught me everything when we couldn't afford proper classes, his weathered hands guiding mine over makeshift flames in our garage studio.

The molten glass glows before me, orange as a setting sun. While the others work with practiced precision, I close my eyes and feel the heat against my face, remembering the stories my grandfather told of galaxies being born. My hands move as if possessed, pulling impossible spirals and delicate arcs from the liquid light.

I hear gasps as my creation takes form—a structure defying convention, part cosmic nebula, part flowering vine. The judges whisper behind their hands. My competitors glance over, their expressions shifting from dismissal to something like wonder.

When the timer sounds, I stand back, drenched in sweat, beside a sculpture that looks nothing like my original design but somehow contains everything I've ever wanted to express. Against all logic and precedent, against masters with generations of technique, I've created something they could not—something wild and honest and new.

The head judge approaches with wide eyes, reaching toward my creation as if to touch a mirage.

I wake just before hearing the verdict, my fingers still tingling with phantom heat.
