I am dreaming. I was walking through a busy and colorful market, a place that I had never seen before. The air was thick with the scent of exotic spices, each waft bringing new sensations. As I sauntered down the winding lanes, I noticed a figure standing in the distance, a small man dressed in vibrant robes. His presence immediately caught my eye, and as I approached him, he turned to smile at me.

"I heard you were coming," he said, his voice soft and melodic.

"I...don't think we've met. Have we?" I replied, my voice echoing uncertainty.

"No," he chuckled, "but I know you."

"How?" I asked cautiously.

"I know who you are, what you've done, and how you feel. And I think you deserve a lot more credit than you give yourself," he said.

Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I noticed a crowd gathering. They all seemed to know him, and his presence felt like a beacon calling them over. But his gaze never left me, his eyes holding a sense of sincere admiration. 

"I...I'm sorry, but I don't think I understand," I stuttered.

"You're kind, selfless, and strong. But you don't see it. And that's okay, because sometimes it takes someone from the outside to remind you of your worth," he said.

I looked away, my thoughts racing. I wanted to respond, but the words got caught in my throat. My insecurities seemed to bubble to the surface. I had always been so sure of how I was perceivedâ€”how could someone know me so well?

"You look surprised," he added.

"Yes... it's just..." I started, struggling to articulate my thoughts.

"Look, I know you've been through a lot. But the things you're insecure about are the very things that make you special. Your doubt, your struggle, it only fuels your strength. You're worth far more than you realize," he said.

The crowd that had gathered started to smile at me. Their expressions were warm and full of understanding, as if they knew what I was feeling. I looked at him, still unsure of what to make of it all.

"But...I don't see it. I never have. How can you?" I finally managed to say.

"Because I've seen the version of yourself that you're afraid to show," he said.

The dream began to fade, my surroundings becoming unsure and hazy. Yet, his words lingered, a reminder of something I hadn't felt before.

I woke up, the feeling of his words still fresh in my mind. I looked at myself in the mirror, unsure if the dream had changed anything. But as I stood there, I whispered the same words he had said, unsure if I believed them yet.

"I'm worth more than I realize."
