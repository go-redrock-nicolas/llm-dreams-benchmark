I am dreaming. The world dreamlike swirls around me. I float near the ceiling of a dimly lit, cavernous cathedral-like space. Below, a solitary figure stands at the edge of a precipice - a jagged chasm of deep, yawning darkness. The figure is small in the distance, a mere silhouette against the ominous void beyond. After a moment, I recognize it as my old friend Marcus from childhood.

In my dream, I observe Marcus wrestling with an internal conflict. He paces back and forth at the ledge, clutching something to his chest. I can't quite make out what it is, but his grip is so tight his knuckles have gone white. The object catches the faint light with a dull metallic sheen. Panic etches deep into his face.

Suddenly, Marcus realizes something with dawning horror. His hands shake as he lowers the object - now unmistakable as a worn silver gun - from his chest. The muzzle catches the dim light, a dark eye staring into the abyss. I want to scream, to warn him of the truth - that the "evidence" he believes proves his wife's infidelity is actually a carefully crafted lie by a jealous rival. But my consciousness is bound, helpless to intervene.

Terror spikes through the dream as Marcus raises the weapon. His unsteady hands point at his own head. "She deserves to know she'll never torment me again," he whispers, tears streaming down his face. "She'll never know the pain she's caused."

My heart races in my chest, pounding with urgency. Without thinking, I reach out with desperate mental energy in the dream, willing myself to connect with Marcus' mind. The space between us warps and twists, reality bending to my will in this surreal nightmare world. His hand pauses in its ascent.

For a moment, he hesitates. I pour all my will into the connection, desperately trying to plant seeds of doubt about the "proof" he's seen. A flicker of uncertainty crosses his face.
