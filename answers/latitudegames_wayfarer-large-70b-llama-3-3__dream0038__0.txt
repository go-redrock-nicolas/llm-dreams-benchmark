I am dreaming. I sprint through glass-plated hallways, my footsteps echoing ominously beneath the crimson emergency lights bathing everything in a hellfire glow. My startup, once a glowing unicorn that drew eager investors and talented employees like moths to a flame, now teeters on the brink of implosion. The crisis that just erupted in the boardroom threatens to vaporize years of sweat and tears in an instant.

Panic-fueled whispers trail in my wake like a destructive force. I can hear snippets as I race past startled employees - " Hackers gained access to client data," "The Questions the Feds are asking," "That meeting that went too far." Each phrase a fresh sword piercing my chest, each step more difficult than the last as the burden of responsibility nearly crushes me.

I burst into my office, slamming the door behind me and leaning against it to catch my breath. The view from my 30th floor window shows a city skyline bathed in the golden hues of sunset, a cruel juxtaposition to the darkness gathering around my company's future. On my desk, my phone blinks with an endless stream of messages from investors demanding explanations, from employees seeking reassurance, from clients firing lawyers at us through email.

The room starts to spin as I try to process it all. Perhaps my subconscious is reaching for an escape from this nightmare. The walls seem to melt like wax, reforming into a tranquil beach. Seagulls wheel overhead, warm sand shifts beneath my feet. A benevolent voice whispers soothing nothings about how it will all work out. My startup, the crisis, it was all just that - a bad dream, fading away like morning mist in the rising sun. I exhale deeply, tension ebbing from my shoulders. Reality snaps back into focus, leaving me disoriented in my office.
