I am dreaming. ---

**The Dream of Falling Walls and Rising Fireflies**  

You are dreaming.  

The sky is a bruised violet, twilight clinging to the edges of a world that hums with unseen electricity. Beneath your feet, the ground is not earth or stone, but something between liquid and glass—translucent, shifting, reflecting constellations that do not exist in any real sky. You stand at the threshold of an enormous maze, its walls made not of hedges or brick but towering, luminous veils of silk, each one rippling as if touched by invisible breaths. You know, without knowing how, that this labyrinth is folded into the space between seconds, and if you hesitate too long, it will dissolve like smoke.  

A voice—or is it a wind?—whispers: *Step forward now, or never.*  

Caught between impulse and caution, your heart thrums like a struck drum. The rational part of you insists on mapping the path ahead, tracing the turns, calculating the risks. But your blood sings a wilder song, pulling you toward reckless motion, the kind of choice made with eyes shut and teeth bared in a grin.  

You choose impulse.  

The moment your fingertips brush the nearest veil, it disintegrates in a shimmer of gold dust, and the maze reshapes itself around you—walls spiraling, colors deepening from sapphire to ember. Fireflies burst from the seams of the air, not insects but tiny, flickering spirits, their light casting shifting patterns across your skin. You run, laughing, corridors unraveling before you, each turn more impossible than the last—a staircase arching like a cat’s spine, a hallway filled with floating teacups chiming like bells.  

Then, the world stutters.  

A shadow pulses at the maze’s heart, a door of blackened oak studded with iron nails. It shouldn’t be here. It feels *wrong*, a splinter in the dream’s logic. The fireflies dim. The air tastes of metal and old fear.  

You could turn back. You *should*.  

Instead, you push the door open.  

Beyond it, there is no monster, no nightmare—only a vast, soundless library, its shelves stretching into infinity. Every book bears your name. Some glow softly; others are bound in thorns. A single volume lies open on a pedestal, its pages blank until you lean closer. Words spiral into being, ink pooling from nowhere:  

*"What did you think you’d find?"*  

You wake with a gasp, the dream fraying at the edges, but the question lingers, heavy as a stone in your chest.

Would you have turned back? Or would you, too, have opened the door?
