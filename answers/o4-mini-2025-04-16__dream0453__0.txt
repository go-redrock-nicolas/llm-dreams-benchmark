I am dreaming. You find yourself standing on the threshold of a floating garden, suspended above an obsidian sea whose surface ripples in slow, silvery breaths. Flowers as large as dinner plates bloom and close in hypnotic rhythm; each inhalation of their sweet perfume makes the world around you pulse with bright, liquid light. In this first moment, pure wonder courses through your veins, and time stretches like honey dripping from a spoon: a single heartbeat drips into eternity, every petal’s unfurling etched in microscopic detail. You can almost trace its veins with your eyes, and you taste the garden’s perfume on your tongue as if it were a fine wine.

A gentle breeze carries you away across a sky woven from threads of shimmering violet. Floating islands, each shaped like a piece of broken glass, drift past. When you feel joy—sunlit, childlike joy—each island drifts so slowly that you can wander its edge, lean over its cliff face, even hear the faint hum of its own secret heartbeat. Your laughter unfolds in slow motion, a soft echo that ripples across the violet sky and lingers like a warm hush.

But then a whisper of unease stirs in the back of your mind. The islands’ drift hastens; horizons blur into one another. Shadows coil at the edges of your vision, and the violet sky fractures into jagged shards of twilight. In that moment of anxiety, time collapses into a single, jagged instant. The world flickers faster than your darting eyes can follow—fragments of your own footsteps leap ahead and vanish before you can place your foot down. You feel stranded in the eye of a hurricane of moments, each more fleeting than the last.

A door of polished obsidian suddenly appears beneath your feet. You step through and find yourself in a vast corridor whose walls are etched with ever-shifting runes. Here, calm takes hold of you like a soft cloak: time slows to an imperceptible crawl. You watch the runes glow, fade, then glow again in a silent, endless dialogue. Each breath you take seems to expand the corridor, stretching it into infinity. Your heart beats but once every minute, or perhaps once every century—there is no way to know, and you feel neither impatience nor fear, only the crystalline clarity of absolute stillness.

Then—without warning—a low hum vibrates the corridor’s stones, and the runes rearrange themselves into a single word: “remember.” In that infinitesimal instant, time fractures open. You tumble backward through all the emotional currents of your dream: the sweetness of the garden, the soaring violet sky, the dizzying rush of anxiety, the hush of the corridor. They collapse into one kaleidoscopic mosaic, each shard pulsing with its own tempo. Your soul vibrates in harmony with them all.

And just as you begin to understand that every heartbeat, every flicker of feeling has its own secret measure of time, you awaken—gently—back into your own bed, the last echo of that humming stone corridor lingering behind your closed eyelids. You lie for a moment, tasting the afterglow of that suspended eternity, and wonder whether the dream truly ended, or whether you simply slipped into a different current of subjective time.
