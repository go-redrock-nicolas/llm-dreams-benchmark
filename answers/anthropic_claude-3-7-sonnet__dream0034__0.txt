I am dreaming. I wake up with a peculiar sensation tingling in my fingertips. The morning light filters through gauzy curtains, but something feels different today. As I reach for the glass of water on my nightstand, ripples form without my touch. Curious, I find myself drawn to the blank canvas that has stood untouched in the corner of my room for months.

When I pick up a paintbrush, it vibrates with an energy I've never felt before. The bristles seem to shimmer with possibility. Facing the empty white expanse of canvas, I realize with startling clarity that today, art has become more than expression—it has become a doorway.

I decide to paint a forest path bathed in golden light. As the colors flow from my brush, the canvas begins to warm beneath my strokes. The painted trees seem to sway slightly, though there is no breeze in my room. With growing wonder, I reach toward the painting and feel my fingers sink into it, passing through the surface as if touching cool water.

Heart pounding, I step fully into my creation. The scent of pine and earth fills my lungs. Sunlight filters through verdant canopies overhead, casting dappled shadows on a path that wasn't there moments ago. Birds I painted with casual brushstrokes now dart between branches, singing melodies I never composed.

I realize this new power allows me to bend reality itself. With each artwork, I can create doorways to places that exist only in imagination—or perhaps they've always existed, waiting for someone to find the way in.

What worlds might I create next? What times might I visit? The brush trembles in my hand with infinite possibility...
