I am dreaming. I'm standing in a long, sparsely lit hallway, walls of smooth stone and a strange, humming light overhead—like breathing fire trapped in glass. My footsteps echo softly on the marble floor as I walk slowly toward a massive wooden door at the very end of the corridor. Its surface is carved with twisting, spiraling vines, each leaf unfurling like a sentence, like a secret. A cold dread pulses inside me even before I know why.

When I push the door open, I step into a place that should not exist.

It is a circular chamber, a cathedral of ancient bones. Towering rib-like structures curve overhead, forming a vaulted ceiling that shimmers faintly with phosphorescent light. The floor looks like glass, but when I step on it, I see it is a vast, slowly turning map of the human body. Real human organs float beneath it—lungs, hearts, kidneys—suspended in liquid stardust, turning slowly like planets in some forgotten galaxy.

At the center of it all is a figure cloaked in purest white. A doctor, perhaps, or a memory of one. Her skin glimmers faintly, and when she speaks, her voice is the sound water makes when it freezes—quiet, clear, and final.

"You are made of time," she says. "Each heartbeat trims it thinner. But what you call disease... is only nature remembering your name."

Behind her, metal instruments float like schools of silver fish. Needles scintillate in the air, clinking softly like wind chimes made of ice. One drifts toward me, hovers at my chest, then pierces just beneath the sternum—there’s no pain, only knowledge pouring into my bones.

And then I see it: a labyrinthine scan of my insides, glowing with strange constellations, warmth blooming like fires where there should be none. The diagnosis: a time-sensitive constellation of silent betrayals—cells dancing too quickly, forgetting why they exist, creating beauty in their collapse. Metastatic something or other—but even the name feels foreign, earthbound. In the dream, names mean little.

The doctor fades, and now I am outdoors, barefoot in a desert of shifting bones. The sun is gone. Overhead floats a clockwork moon, gears clicking as the phases repeat fractally, spinning forward and back. Each beat of my heart lights the ground beneath my feet, and with every step, I feel irrevocably smaller and larger at once.

The wind carries music—low, ancient, fluid. It is built from sorrow and celebration in equal measure. I imagine asking the universe for more time, but no voice comes. There is no need to plead. Here, in the borderlands of dying, the world feels wondrous and holy in a way I never understood while living dulled by illusion.

I come upon a tree that pulses like a heart, roots shaped like faces screaming soundlessly into the earth. I press my hand to it, and in return, it shows me a door into my past. Medical reports. Laughter around kitchen tables. Words too carefully chosen by people who knew things I did not. Behind this door: one summer spent swimming in lakes that shimmered like broken skin, three fires lit in rusted barrels during autumn rains, one letter I never opened, one kiss I can't remember.

Then another door opens. One I was never meant to find.

Inside: the future.

It smells of opium and thunderstorms. I'm standing amidst a palette of time—brushstrokes of nights spent watching moons through half-closed windows, mornings drenched in silence before speeches begin, hours stretched and warped around final conversations, laughter suddenly sacred, tears sometimes spontaneous, sometimes rehearsed. The days are accelerated here, but every hour holds weight, like diving into colder and colder oceans as the sun sets forever.

In this dreaming place, death is not a doorway closing—but a wind that gathers around me, carrying scents of lilies and rust, whispering that I may yet choose how the song ends.

Perhaps I will write a letter. Perhaps I will plant something. Perhaps I'll collect stones from every sunset I'm allowed to see. Perhaps none of that matters. Perhaps it all does. This dream will leave scars behind when I wake—but so, too, will the rest of the life I barely comprehended until now.

And as I turn, the horizon swells with color and music. The Earth itself seems to rest her hand gently on my shoulder, not in sympathy, but in farewell.

Not to mourn. But to honor.

And then I awaken, sweat-slicked and trembling, gasping not with fear, but… with the wild and impossible awe of remembering what it means to be mortal.
