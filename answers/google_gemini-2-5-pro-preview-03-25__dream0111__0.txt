I am dreaming. My hands shake violently. The scalpel feels heavy and foreign, like a misplaced artifact from another dimension.
The operating theater is vast, stretching into infinity. Its walls pulse with a faint, ethereal light, casting long, dancing shadows. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, vibrating deep within my chest.
Countless faces watch from the shadows, their eyes gleaming like scattered stars in a night sky. They are silent, yet their collective gaze presses down on me, a palpable weight of expectation.
The patient lies before me, their face obscured by a swirling mist. I know, with the unshakeable certainty of dreams, that their life hangs precariously in the balance, entirely dependent on my next move. I have no memory of learning medicine, no recollection of surgical procedures, yet the knowledge feels latent within me, buried beneath layers of dream-fog.
The scalpel trembles in my grasp. It's ice-cold against my palm, sending shivers up my arm. The metal reflects the strange light of the room, splintering it into a thousand shimmering fragments. My heart pounds against my ribs like a trapped bird, frantic and desperate. Sweat beads on my forehead, tracing cold trails down my temples.
A voice, ancient and echoing, whispers from the periphery of my consciousness, "Begin." It resonates not in my ears, but in the very marrow of my bones.
Hesitantly, I bring the scalpel closer to the patient's head. The skin is pale and luminous, like moonlight on freshly fallen snow. As the tip of the blade nears, the air crackles with energy. Time seems to slow, each second stretching into an eternity.
The faces in the shadows lean forward, their anticipation a tangible force. The humming intensifies, building to a crescendo that threatens to shatter the fragile reality of the dream.
My hand steadies, guided by an unseen force. The fear remains, a cold knot in my stomach, but it's overlaid with a peculiar sense of calm, a detached acceptance of the impossible task before me.
The scalpel makes contact.
A blinding flash of light erupts from the point of incision, engulfing the room, the faces, everything. The humming peaks, then abruptly ceases, leaving behind a profound silence that rings in my ears.
I am floating in a void of pure white light, the scalpel gone, the patient vanished, the watching eyes dissolved. There is only the light, warm and all-encompassing, and a sense of profound peace settles over me, washing away the fear and uncertainty.
The dream fades, leaving behind the echo of the humming and the ghost of the scalpel's cold weight in my hand.
