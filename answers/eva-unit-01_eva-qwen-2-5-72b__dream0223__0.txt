I am dreaming. I find myself amidst the chaos of a once-thriving city, now reduced to rubble by an unforeseen calamity. Smoke billows into the sky as the cacophony of human suffering envelops me. Screams echo, beggars for help, and the groans of the injured amalgamate into a haunting melody of despair.

When I arrive at the makeshift hospital, I am thrust into a world of organized confusion. Patients lie strewn across the floor, waiting in agony for medical intervention. The air hums with the frenzied energy of the overworked staff, frantically triaging the casualties as the resources dwindle. 

At that moment, a conflict emerges between two leading physicians - each proposing conflicting protocols to manage the overwhelming influx of patients. Caught between them, I must carefully consider their divergent viewpoints while making split-second decisions on whom to help next.

As I tend to the wounded, I am haunted by the faces of those I cannot save. Each decision weighs heavily; the undeniable reality that I must choose who lives and who perishes is a burden I struggle to bear.

I am compelled to adapt and grow as my world crumbles around me. Just when I think I've come to terms with the situation, an aftershock rocks the hospital, showcasing the unimaginable fragility of our constructed safety, unleashing chaos yet again.

But amidst this bedlam, there are also triumphant moments - a life saved, a glimmer of hope in an ocean of suffering. These fleeting triumphs fuel my resolve, pushing me to persevere against all odds.

I am dreaming.
