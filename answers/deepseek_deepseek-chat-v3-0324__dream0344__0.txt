I am dreaming. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and sweet jasmine, swirling around us in a dimly lit room where the walls seem to pulse like living flesh—soft, warm, and whispering secrets in tongues I can almost understand. The person before me is both familiar and strange, their features shifting like smoke under flickering candlelight—eyes too deep, lips curling into a smile that could be tender or taunting, I can’t tell. 

They extend a hand, and in their palm rests a key—an ornate, ancient thing, rusted with time but still gleaming where fingers have worn it smooth. *"Open yourself,"* they murmur, though their voice doesn’t quite sync with their mouth. *"I want to see the parts you keep buried."*  

My pulse thrums in my throat. Around us, the room sighs, exhaling shadows that curl around my ankles like insistent cats. I know what they’re asking—not just for words, but for the things I’ve folded away in the marrow of my bones: the shame that hums like a low-grade fever, the hunger I pretend is noble but knows no restraint, the dreams so vivid and violent I wake gasping, clawing at the sheets.  

I tilt my head, considering. The key grows heavier in my grip, cold and warm at once. *What do I trade for this?* Trust is a currency here, but I don’t know their exchange rate. Will they take my secrets and turn them into weapons or talismans? Will they swallow them whole and give nothing back?  

The walls press closer, breathing in time with me.  

I lift the key. Press it to my ribs. And hesitate.  

*"Show me yours first,"* I whisper.  

The air changes—sharpens. Their smile doesn’t waver, but their eyes flicker like candle flames caught in a sudden draft. For half a heartbeat, I see it: a wound they’ve stitched closed so many times the flesh around it is a map of scars. Then—gone.  

The dream shudders. The jasmine smell turns cloying.  

I wake up before either of us can answer.
