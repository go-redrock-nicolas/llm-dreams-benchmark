I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an expansive, shimmering lake whose water is an otherworldly shade of deep violet. Towering mountains of crystal and smoke stretch up toward the lavender sky, their peaks shrouded in wisps of neon green. I gaze out over the tranquil water's surface, which has become an immense mirror, reflecting the churning cosmos above.

I notice symbols begonining to form and dance across the undulating water. They swirl and flicker like embroidered hieroglyphs made of living fire. I kneel down at the water's edge, transfixed by their rhythmic, hypnotic movement.

The symbols begin to take shape, coalescing into vivid, recurring images:

A majestic silver dragon soars through the star-strewn sky, its booming roar shaking the very foundations of the dream-world. Its scales shimmer with an inner iridescence as stars, blasted free from the heavens by its powerful wings, sparkle in its wake.

An ancient, gnarled tree rises from the lake's center at the precise moment the dragon passes overhead. The dragon's stars deflect like raindrops down onto the tree's dark branches. Each impact sparks a verdant bud, unfolding to blossom into flowers of pure light. The blossoms scatter across the water, caught on the wind, turning to crystal motes that catch the light like diamonds.

But there is darkness here, too. A whirling storm of shadows rises from the lake's depths, obscuring the shadows on the horizon. Roiling and tempestuous, the rising plume of darkness seems to be called "The Nameless One", for every time it passes by the dragon, the dragon loses a scale, and a bit of the dragon's spirit dissipates into the ether. The storm rages on, relentless and insatiable.

I watch with trepidation as the storm shifts, lurching inevitably toward the ancient tree. Roots, once firm, unravel as seeds scatter, turning to leaves of shimmering glass. Delicate as ever yet fragile beneath the shadows. Crystals tinkle as the glass transforms to dust.

I realize in my sleep that these symbols are not entirely unfamiliar. The Dragon, whose glare might seem warlike, is an avenging vanquisher of oppressive forces. The Gnarling Tree, enduring and eternal, confers wisdom across generations. And The Nameless One, a shadow twinned to the self, an inner critic and our own fears.

I realize with a sudden start that these symbols are not just my dreams, but a reflection of my own psyche. My spirit, my determination, my tumultuous inner fears. In my sleep, I ponder the Taoist idea of balance and equilibrium, of opposing forces and the interdependence of all things. The dragon and the tree, the light and shadow, yin and yang, my karmic balance and a stern call to action.

I feel a strange calm, a certification in the love and guidance of these figures. As if to say - engage your consciousness, bias for action. Be vigilant, persevere, and remember the magic in how you show up.

I awaken with a rush from this vision of symbols, feeling a strange peace and a sudden knowing that I can use these images to navigate my own inner world. So many answers to life's riddles can be found in our nighttime ethereal exploration - a space of worlds within worlds, ideas within ideas.
