I am dreaming. <placeholderno5>

I find myself standing at the edge of an iridescent lake, its surface shimmering like spilled oil under a twilight sky streaked with auroras. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, as though the atmosphere itself is alive. In my hands rests a paintbrush made of light, its bristles flickering like filaments of a dying star. I have never painted before, yet my arm moves autonomously, dragging trails of liquid color across the air itself, each stroke crystallizing into stained-glass butterflies that rise and scatter.

Beneath the water, shadowy figures glide—faceless, but radiating curiosity. They surface, their forms dissolving into inkblots that seep into the lake’s edges, forming obsidian cliffs etched with glowing hieroglyphs I cannot read but somehow *feel*: *"The untrained hand carves galaxies."* 

A bridge of chord progressions materializes—wooden planks humming like cello strings—urging me forward. As I cross, the butterflies convene into a mosaic of my own face, morphing into creatures with wings of shattered mirrors. They reflect not my image, but scenes: a child stacking pebbles into castles, a teen scrawling lyrics on fogged windows, an elder I don’t recognize weaving constellations into tapestries. 

The lake drains, revealing a labyrinth of half-sculpted marble lungs breathing out clouds of copper dust. I inhale, and the dust becomes a symphony, each note a color, each chord a texture. My untrained hands are raw and glowing. I realize—*this* is the training: the itch, the errors, the relentless act of shaping the formless. 

I wake clutching a feather that evaporates, its final whisper lingering: *"Unmade things need you most."*
