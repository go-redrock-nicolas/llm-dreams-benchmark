I am dreaming. In my dreamscape, a vibrant garden unfolds before me. Vibrantly colored flowers from different seasons and geographical regions harmoniously coexist in full bloom. Irises dance alongside lilies, tulips mingle with roses, and exotic orchids intermingle with native wildflowers. The garden, housed in a vast greenhouse, creates an ephemeral paradise that transcends the boundaries of time, space, and geography.

As I breathe in the intense fragrances and marvel at the diverse flora, I catch a glimpse of a stunning azure rose nestled among crimson poppies. Amid the garden's enchanting beauty, I also notice a shimmering portal inviting me towards an unknown realm.

The luminous portal transports me to the depths of the cosmos. Here, the universe unveils its most breathtaking wonders - spiral nebulas gently swirl in hues of pink and purple as colossal stars burn brightly against the cosmic void. Planets, moons, and stars dance in perfect harmony guided by an unseen cosmic choreography, a mesmerizing celestial ballet that instills a profound sense of awe and humility.

Opportunity summons me to cross a cosmic bridge that shimmers with unworldly light, seemingly connecting disparate space-time dimensions. As I traverse this bridge, a kaleidoscope of colors surrounds me, blending and intersecting in a breathtaking cosmic dance that transcends the conventional rules of light and perception.

I dream of these ethereal places and experiences long after I awake. In those fleeting moments, I strive to retain their vividness as they mingle with the memories of my memories and the reality of my fleeting existence.
