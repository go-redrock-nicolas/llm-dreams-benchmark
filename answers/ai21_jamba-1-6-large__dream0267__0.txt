I am dreaming. I dream of lying motionless on a vast, shimmering ocean under an endless expanse of twilight. The sky is a blend of deepest violet and molten gold, streaked with iridescent trails that pulse like living veins. I feel the water beneath me, cool and alive, cradling me in its gentle embrace, as though I am both a part of it and separate, like a droplet destined to merge with the sea.

Above me, constellations sparkle with an unearthly brilliance, their patterns unfamiliar yet achingly familiar, as though they are memories from another life. Each star pulses in rhythm with my heartbeat, which I can hear in the ethereal silence, deep and resonant, like the tolling of a distant bell.

I sense movement beneath me, a stirring of something immense and ancient. The ocean shifts, revealing glimpses of glowing creatures beneath its surface—beings of light and shadow, neither fish nor human, their forms fluid and transient, like thoughts. They weave intricate patterns beneath the surface, their light casting vibrant ripples that dance across the water.

As I float, I feel an overwhelming sense of connection—to the stars above, the water below, and everything in between. Yet there is no fear, no urgency. Only peace, an acceptance so profound it borders on the divine.

In the distance, I hear the faint call of something—a voice? A song?—soothing and hypnotic. It grows closer, weaving itself into the fabric of the dream, until it feels as though it is part of me. I feel my boundaries dissolve, my consciousness expanding until I am no longer sure where I end and the dream begins.

And then, as the light of the stars grows brighter, the dream begins to fade. I feel myself drifting upward, pulled gently toward waking, yet unwilling to leave. The ocean's embrace lingers, and the stars' song echoes in my soul.

I awaken, breathless and drenched in moonlight, with the faintest impression of having touched the infinite.
