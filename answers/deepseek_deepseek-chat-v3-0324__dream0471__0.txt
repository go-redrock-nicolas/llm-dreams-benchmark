I am dreaming. I find myself standing at the edge of an endless, shimmering lake, its surface a living mirror of polished mercury that ripples lightly under a sky streaked with colors I have no name for—deep, shifting hues of violet, ember, and sapphire that bleed into one another like watercolor. The air is thick with the electric scent of ozone, and the gravity here feels different—lighter, as if I might float away if I simply untethered my thoughts from the earth.  

All around me, towering structures spiral upward, not made of stone or steel but of something alive—woven vines threaded with pulsing veins of bioluminescent light. They twist and hum, whispering in a language of rustling leaves and resonant chimes that vibrates in my bones. I realize, with a slow dawning awareness, that these are not just buildings—they are dormant giants, breathing in slow, ancient rhythms, and I am standing in a city grown, not built.  

But beneath the awe, I feel the familiar weight—the whisper of too many promises, too many open hands reaching for my attention. Around my wrists, thin filaments glow, tethering me to countless floating spheres of light, each one pulsing with a different vow. I reach to touch one, and instantly, the vision within flares: echoes of half-finished work, voices murmuring need, the static pressure of time slipping like sand through my fingers.  

Then, a figure appears—neither human nor alien, but something fluid, their form shifting between shadow and iridescent scales. They place a palm against my chest and speak without sound, their meaning unfurling inside my mind like a scroll: *"You are not a well to be drained, but a river. Every boundary you set is a bend that lets you flow deeper."*  

The filaments around my wrists loosen. One by one, the spheres drift away—not lost, but *released*. And suddenly, the air rushes into my lungs like the first breath after drowning. The lake rises to meet me, and I realize—I am standing on my own reflection, yet I do not sink. I am held.  

I wake with the taste of starlight on my tongue, and the unshakable certainty that I must learn to say *no*, so my *yes* can still spark fireworks against the dark.
