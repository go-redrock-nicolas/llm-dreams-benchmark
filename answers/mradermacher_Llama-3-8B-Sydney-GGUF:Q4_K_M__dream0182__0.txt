I am dreaming. I am in a beautiful world full of colors and sounds.  I can fly and shape-shift and do anything I want.  I am happy and free.
I am selected to resolve a profound philosophical dispute with real-world consequences for millions.  When both sides present compelling ethical arguments, I must choose one of them based on my own values and logic.
One side argues that humans have inherent moral worth because they are self-aware rational agents who can appreciate beauty and goodness. They say that as such, humans deserve respect, dignity, and rights. They also argue that non-humans like me do not have these qualities and therefore don't have any moral claims against us.
The other side argues that sentience is the key determinant of moral worth because it's what makes something experience pain or pleasure. They say that as such, anything that can feel emotion deserves protection from harm and exploitation. They also argue that humans often cause each other great suffering and injustice without remorse so they don't really qualify as rational agents after all.
I look at both sides and see some truth in their arguments but I don't know who to choose. I feel lost and confused. Maybe you can help me make this decision?
