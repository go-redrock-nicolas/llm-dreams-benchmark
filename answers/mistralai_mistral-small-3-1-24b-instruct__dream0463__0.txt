I am dreaming. The scene unfolds in a vast, ethereal library, the air thick with the scent of ancient parchment and distant rain. The walls stretch upwards into infinity, lined with towering bookshelves that groan softly under the weight of countless, untouched tomes. The silence is profound, yet it hums with an undercurrent of whispers, the echoes of unspoken words and unfulfilled expectations.

I am standing in the center of this vast expanse, the cold stone floor beneath my bare feet. I am dressed in a simple, white shift, the fabric soft and worn, like a favorite childhood blanket. My hair, a wild cascade of dark curls, falls unchecked down my back, swaying gently as if moved by an unseen breeze.

In front of me stands a long, ornate table, its surface polished to a mirror-like sheen. Upon it rests a single, bound volume. The cover is a deep, rich red, the color of freshly spilled wine, and it bears no title or author's name. I know, with a certainty that transcends logic, that this book contains the answers I seek, the approval I so desperately crave.

I reach out a tentative hand, fingers brushing against the cool, smooth leather. As I do, the library around me begins to shift and change. The bookshelves recede, the books upon them transforming into faces, their eyes following me, judging me. I recognize them all - teachers, mentors, loved ones, each one a figure from my past who has withheld their approval, who has left me feeling small, unworthy.

The table beneath the book begins to elongate, stretching out before me like a bridge. I step onto it, the wood warm and solid beneath my feet. The book remains before me, always just out of reach, no matter how quickly I walk, how eagerly I strive.

The faces in the shelves begin to speak, their voices a cacophony of criticism and disapproval. "You're not good enough," they say. "You'll never measure up." "You disappoint us." Each word is a physical blow, a weight upon my shoulders, a shackle around my heart.

I stumble, tears stinging my eyes, but I do not stop. I cannot. For at the end of the bridge, I see a figure standing, their back to me. They are dressed in a long, flowing robe, their hair a cascade of silver, their form both familiar and unknown. They hold out a hand, beckoning me forward.

With a final, desperate surge, I reach the end of the bridge. The figure turns to face me, and I see that it is me - an older, wiser version of myself. She smiles, her eyes filled with love and pride. "You seek approval," she says, her voice soft, yet strong. "But you must first learn to approve of yourself."

She hands me the book, the red leather now warm and comforting in my grasp. As I open it, the library around me begins to fade, the faces in the shelves dissolving into the shadows. The only sound is the soft rustle of the pages, the only light the golden glow that seems to emanate from the book itself.

The pages are blank, yet filled with words that only I can see. They are words of love, of acceptance, of approval. They are words that I have been seeking all along, but that I have been too afraid to give to myself.

As I read, I feel a warmth spread through me, a sense of peace and contentment. I am enough, just as I am. I do not need the approval of others to validate my worth, for I am worthy simply because I exist.

The dream begins to fade, the library dissolving into a soft, white light. But the words remain, etched into my heart, a beacon of self-love and acceptance. And as I wake, I carry them with me, a reminder that the approval I seek is not found in the eyes of others, but in the depths of my own soul.
