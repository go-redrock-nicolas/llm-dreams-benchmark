I am dreaming. I stand on a windswept cliffside, ethereal mist swirling around my shins as I gaze out at the storm-tossed sea. Below me, someone I love dearly - a dear friend, Sarah - is standing precariously close to the edge. Her back is turned to me, her silhouette stark against the churning waters.

As I watch in growing horror, Sarah reaches into her coat pocket and withdraws a small vial of glowing liquid. Her hand trembles as she uncorks it, and I can almost see the dangerous thoughts swirling in her mind. The wind howls around us, seeming to carry her whispered words: "I can't take it anymore."

I call out in desperate warning, "Sarah! Wait! Please!" But my voice is swallowed by the gale. I try to run to her, reaching out to grab her arm, but my feet feel heavy, as if rooted to the spot. The wind pushes me back, making it harder to approach.

Sarah turns slightly, enough for me to see the haunted look in her eyes. I see the glimmer of the vial as it trembles at her lips. My heart pounds against my ribs, each beat stretching like an eternity. I feel a lump form in my throat, choking back a sob of despair.

Suddenly, I'm standing in Sarah's apartment, watching as she methodically packs a suitcase. Each item she places inside is like a knife to my heart. I try to speak, to reason with her, to show her how much she means to me, to point out all the things she has to live for. But no sound comes out. I'm trapped in a nightmare of my own making, unable to save her from herself.

The scene shifts again. I'm in a crowded hospital room, and Sarah lies unconscious in a white bed. Beeping machines surround her, their steady rhythm a mockingly steady sound in the chaos of my mind. I'm gripping her limp hand, pouring all the love and concern I can muster into that touch. The doctors' voices drift in and out of focus as they speak of organ damage and chances of recovery. It's all so hazy.

And then, like a cruel joke, everything fades to black. I wake with a start, my pillow damp with tears and my chest aching as if I've been crying out loud for hours. But it's just a dream... or is it? The vividness, the intensity of the emotions - it all felt so real. As I lay here in the dark, heart still pounding, I can't help but wonder what Sarah is really going through. Is she struggling as desperately as she was in my dream? And can I somehow find a way to reach her, to make her hear me when her mind is made up?
