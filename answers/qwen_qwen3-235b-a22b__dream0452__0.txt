I am dreaming. … I am dreaming, and in this dreaming, I am standing at the edge of a vast, silver lake under a charcoal sky, where the stars flicker like lanterns long forgotten. Trees lean in close, their bark dark and glistening like obsidian, their branches reaching towards the heavens with a kind of silent yearning. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and something more elusive—a sweetness long gone from my waking life.

There is music, or perhaps it’s the wind, but it moves like a whispering hymn through the tall reeds—something familiar but out of reach, like a lullaby my grandmother might have once known. I feel a heaviness in my chest, slow and echoing, like the last chime of a cathedral bell at dusk. The dream breathes with me.

And then, from across the lake, I see it.

A figure. Draped in flowing layers of woven twilight—violet, deep red, and the color of moonlit fog. The light catches it, and I know it is not a stranger. It is someone I once held closely, once let shape the shapelessness of my heart. Their presence is soft at first, like embers quietly dying, but I can feel the weight of what it once was.

They walk toward me with a grace that has grown distant, their steps light, but the ground beneath them cracks like dry riverbed. As they near, I realize that their eyes carry less fire than before, dulled not by hatred, but by slow erosion—something that felt like warmth for so long but now burns more like the sun at noon: necessary, but painful to meet directly.

In my hand, I hold a single white rose—still perfect, unbruised—but as I stand there, the petals begin to curl, one by one turning gray, then falling like ash into the lake.

I don't speak. Not yet.

But within me, everything is shifting, rearranging. The dream knows before I do. And then I understand.

There was a time when this connection was sun and soil to me, a vine that twisted its way into the very core of who I am. I gave it roots without question, gave it my warmth, my storms, my quiet nights. It fed me once. The laughter was honey. The silences were still sacred. But now the vine has thickened into something heavy, coiled not for support, but for dependence. The golden fruit has withered into something that seems fertile but yields nothing. My truth has bent to keep it alive.

Suddenly, the dream pirouettes in tone. The lake beneath me no longer reflects the sky. It shows my face, but younger, eyes wide with trust. Then pages of letters. Then a series of quiet extendings, hand after hand reaching my way, only to find petals withering. And still I reached back.

The figure stops just short of touching me, and their voice, when it comes, sounds like a song I loved in childhood:

_"Can't things stay as they were?"_

And I want to say yes. I want the dream to turn and carry us back to when we were wonder. When even silence felt like music.

But I have grown in sleep as much as in the world. I see now that growth demands an honesty that used to terrify me. The dream world bends and stretches in agreement.

So I extend my hands—not in pleading, but in release.

"Look," I say gently, and between my palms floats a tiny flame, flickering against the encroaching dark of night. "We were a fire once. And we lit so many rooms for each other. But fires must die if they are to be rekindled in truth."

The figure bows.

The flame still burns.

And in that sacred space between hearts held and hearts released, the lake begins to melt into light—as if the stars have not merely fallen, but are swirling up through the water, calling me back toward the sky.

The dream does not end.

But it turns … quietly … toward becoming something else.
