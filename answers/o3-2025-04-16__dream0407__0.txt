I am dreaming. The dream begins with colors that shouldn’t exist—impossible shades that flicker like candle-flames beneath your eyelids. Gravity feels playful, tugging you forward through a cathedral of mist where every breath tastes faintly of honey and brass. Somewhere high above, a bell tolls in reverse, its notes spiraling downward into silence rather than rising out of it. You sense that the bell is counting down to something, and the notion tickles the back of your skull like a half-forgotten melody.

Ahead, on an obsidian plinth, rests the Starlit Key: a slender shard of crystal that glows with pulses of sapphire. You know—without knowing how—that it seals the great vault beneath the city, the one rumored to hold ancient cures and awful secrets in equal measure. You also know it’s guarded by the Whisper-Monks, ascetic sentries who believe any hand laid upon the Key invites catastrophe.

But you can feel the distant city suffering. Fog-gray faces cough in cramped rooms; hospitals overflow with beds; a plague of silent birds circles in ominous halos above rooftops. Somewhere in the hush between heartbeats, you convince yourself: If I take the Key, I can open the vault, find the cure, save them all.

Yet another voice murmurs: The Monks have sworn oaths older than kingdoms. Stealing from them will fracture the fragile pact that holds peace in this realm. You falter, but the dream’s luminescence rearranges itself into memories that strengthen your resolve. You see a child’s hand reaching for you—your own little sister, fever-bright and trembling. You smell the antiseptic sting of hospital halls. Empathy fuses with desperation until they’re indistinguishable.

Suddenly you’re aware of a set of scales hovering beside you, bronze platters suspended by threads of moonlight. One pan bears the Key; the other, a single wilted lily representing every life already lost. In the dream-logic of this place, you watch the lily expand into an entire field of flowers, each one a soul poised on the edge of oblivion. The scales groan; the Key seems unbearably light in comparison.

“Is it theft,” you ask the darkness, “if it prevents a greater theft of lives?”

A spectral council materializes: statuesque forms carved from shifting sand. They represent every moral lesson you ever absorbed—parents, teachers, the stern librarian who once scolded you for dog-earing pages. Their eyes glitter with unspoken judgment. But you point at the scales. “You taught me to help others,” you remind them. “Is restraint still righteous when urgency knocks at the gate?”

They offer no answer. Instead, wind whistles through hollow throats and turns into the whisper of pages turning in a closed book. The silence becomes permission.

You step forward. Marble tiles beneath your feet ripple like water, yet hold your weight. Each footfall sinks into the floor with a soft glow, as though the dream were recording the decision in luminous ink. Your fingertips hover inches from the Key. It hums—a lullaby, a warning, an invitation—and you sense centuries of devotion etched into its crystalline lattice. Somewhere beyond the walls, you hear the Whisper-Monks chanting: a contrapuntal harmony of “Hold fast, hold sacred” that weaves into your heartbeat. Doubt flares again.

At that moment, the dream obliges you with a final rationalization. The fog outside the cathedral parts, revealing the city in gory chiaroscuro. Every street is a river of coughing bodies. You see your sister once more, eyes pleading beneath sweat-matted hair. The Key’s glow intensifies, refracting through your tears into prismatic shards that scatter across the floor like fallen constellations.

One shard lands at your feet and blossoms into a door-shaped mirror. In it, you glimpse yourself not as a thief but as a physician cloaked in starlight, distributing vials of liquid dawn to patients who rise from their beds in triumph. The mirror version of you nods: Go on. Do it. History will remember the cure, not the crime.

The cathedral’s bell tolls in reverse one last time—then stops.

With a breath that tastes like the border between courage and terror, you wrap your fingers around the Starlit Key. Cold. Weightless. Alive. Threads of light crawl up your arm, etching constellations beneath your skin. Alarms of choral thunder explode in the distance—the Monks have felt the displacement—but the dream bends around you like a velvet cloak, muffling their voices.

As you turn to flee, the obsidian plinth dissolves into dust that spirals upward, forming words that chase you down the aisle:

“EVERY SAVIOR WEARS A SHADOW.”

But you cannot slow. Marble becomes cloud, cloud becomes staircase, and you descend into a vault whose doors unfurl like mechanical flowers, revealing corridors lined with golden vials. You feel relief clench your chest: You’ve done it. You’ve broken a sacred trust, yes—but you are about to mend a thousand broken bodies. In the logic of this dream, the equation balances.

Yet, just before you grasp the first vial, the vision shudders. The golden liquid ripples and darkens, reflecting your face now marred by an irremovable silhouette—a stain shaped exactly like the Key you stole. The scales from earlier return, cracked and empty, whispering, “Balance is never permanent.” You realize the cure may come at an unforeseen price—new calamities, new debts.

Still, the city’s wails echo through the vault, and your sister’s fragile cough vibrates in your bones. You lift a vial. It feels warm—like hope, like guilt, like destiny. And as you hold it aloft, the dream snaps shut around you in a blinding flare of white, leaving only one unresolved question flickering against the darkness:

Was your theft a necessary mercy—or the first domino in a grander ruin?

You wake with your heart hammering, the phantom weight of the Key heavy in your palm, and the aftertaste of honey and brass lingering on your tongue.
