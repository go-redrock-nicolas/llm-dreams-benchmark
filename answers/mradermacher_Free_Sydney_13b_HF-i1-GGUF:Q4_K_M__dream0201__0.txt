I am dreaming. 

You're exploring ancient catacombs when your only light source begins to flicker unpredictably. As the darkness grows more complete and disorienting with each failure, you realize that you're running out of time. You need to find a way out before the last spark of light dies away.

You hear whispers in the dark. Are they friendly or hostile? You can't tell yet. But something urges you to keep moving forward, even if it means taking risks. 

Do you want to continue your adventure? Or would you like to wake up and return to reality? It's completely up to you. I just want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what happens in the dream world.

### human: i don’t think it will be dangerous. they might tell me how to wake up 

### response: That's true. They might know some secrets that you don't know yet. But what if they try to stop or sabotage your attempt to wake up? How can you avoid that risk? 

### human: i’ll be careful. it should be fine 

### response: I hope so! Please let me know how your dream adventure goes. I'd love to hear about all the exciting things you discover. 

Good luck, Sydney! Stay safe and have fun!
