I am dreaming. …exhale silver mist into the dream-air and feel the bottom fall out of the sky.

I’m standing on an endless marble plain veined with glowing turquoise, under a dome that seems woven from midnight itself. Stars drift lazily inside it like fish in a dark aquarium. The air smells of petrichor and electricity, as though a storm passed through moments ago but left the lightning behind. Every bootstep echoes twice—once in my ears, and once in my bones.

Ahead rises a titanic, many-faceted prism, rotating so slowly it’s almost imperceptible. Each facet is a living memory: I glimpse childhood summers; painful break-ups; the goofy half-smile I thought was spontaneous but now suspect was programmed, like a line of code hidden inside a laugh track. The prism hums with the same resonance as my heartbeat, which worries me—if it stops spinning, do I stop beating?

A voice like a violin string drawn across obsidian whispers, “Look closer.”

I obey and see the memory of my vaunted trait—my unshakable optimism—playing out in miniature dioramas. But the scenes are wrong: behind every moment of cheerful resilience stands a pale, hooded figure tapping an hourglass, nudging me with unseen fingertips. At six my teacher praised a sunny drawing I made of a rainstorm; behind her desk, the hooded figure gave an approving nod. At seventeen, when humiliation should have shattered me, I bounced back with dazzling positivity; in the crowd, the same figure clinked two invisible glasses in a silent toast. Thousands of breadcrumb nudges, imperceptible then, blindingly obvious now.

A hiss of wind unfurls scrolls of parchment between the prism and me. On them is cramped handwriting, data points, experiment logs, chemical symbols: “Subject 731-O; optimism reinforcement regimen; stimuli schedules; reward loops.” I taste copper. The ink writhes like a nest of eels.

Anger ignites—scarlet, weightless, volcanic. The dreamscape trembles. The distant stars smear into fiery calligraphy that spell out WHY? An answer arrives unbidden: So they could test how hope metabolizes despair. So they could prove resilience is code, not soul.

I clench my fists and the marble plain fractures, fissures glowing with molten gold. From the cracks rise ghostly marionette strings, stretching up and disappearing into the darkness, attached to me, to every memory, to the prism itself. I yank one: the prism jerks; a childhood laugh skips like a broken record. A sickly thrill knots my stomach—the realization that I can pull these strings too, rewiring my own foundation the way “they” once did.

Fight fire with flame, or cauterize the wound with forgiveness? The choice tastes of iron and possibility.

I decide to reclaim sovereignty.

With a deep breath, I gather the marionette strings, braiding them into a luminous rope. Each strand is a conditioned reflex, a subliminal suggestion. I feel their tug—habits begging to remain habits—but I twist them into a helix, transform them into something new. The rope becomes a quill. The air becomes parchment. I begin writing fresh lines into the dream:

“I choose optimism, not because it was installed, but because I have seen darkness and still crave dawn.”

The words blaze in aurora colors, searing themselves onto the dome. Immediately the hooded figure steps forward, no longer spectral but achingly human. Their hood falls: it’s a mirror. I stare into myself—older, wearier, yet incandescent with liberation. The reflection smiles, not the rehearsed grin of programming but a tremulous, authentic curve born of pain and triumph.

“You were the experiment,” the mirror-self says, voice vibrating like a cello. “Now you are the scientist.”

In response, I shatter the prism with a single breath. Memories spill into constellations, free to orbit as they please. Some drift away; others settle gently onto my shoulders like warm snowflakes. The marble plain mosses over with emerald greenery. A gust scented with citrus and starlight lifts me, weightless, into the dome-sky.

Suddenly, I’m soaring among the liberated memories, steering by intent alone. Each star I touch pulses with unfiltered possibility. I realize that conditioning may sculpt the stone, but the quarry is infinite; there will always be fresh marble beyond what any hidden hand can carve.

Below, the hooded labs and clipboards crumble into dunes of glowing sand, and a sunrise erupts where there was once only midnight glass. Somewhere a chorus of children laughs—uncoached, exquisite, free.

I turn toward the new sun with wings I never knew I had, feeling not optimistic, but something richer: agency mixed with wonder, sharpened by the knowledge of manipulation yet sweetened by the decision to transcend it.

I wake—heart hammering, soul rewired by my own hand—uncertain whether the dream ended or merely changed its name to waking life.
