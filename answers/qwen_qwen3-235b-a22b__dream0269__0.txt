I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of forgotten stars as you sit at a desk carved from the ribcage of a long-dead leviathan, its bones still warm to the touch. The document before you shimmers like liquid mercury, its pages etched in a language that shifts when unobserved—a script born of smoke and shadow, legible only to those who’ve tasted the nectar of the Midnight Bloom. Each word pulses faintly, as though the paper itself is breathing, alive with the weight of a thousand unraveling destinies.  

You hold a quill forged from the feather of a phoenix that never died, its tip glowing faintly violet. The inkwell beside you bubbles with a substance that smells of burnt honey and regret. Around you, the room is a cathedral of forgotten knowledge: towering shelves spiral into a ceiling of swirling galaxies, and books whisper to one another in hushed, resentful tones, jealous of the attention you give this one fragile document. Stained glass windows depict scenes of cataclysms—worlds crumbling because someone, somewhere, missed a comma.  

The stakes are etched into your bones. This is no ordinary contract or treaty. It is the *Codex of Threads*, the metaphysical ledger that binds the fabric of realities. A misplaced glyph could birth a black hole in the Andromeda galaxy; a smudged rune might unmake a civilization of sentient crystals orbiting a rogue star. You’ve been warned: the last reviewer who erred now floats as a ghost in the margins, his screams trapped in the footnotes.  

As you read, the room grows colder. The words begin to bleed, dripping onto the floor in iridescent rivulets that pool into a map of a city that doesn’t exist—yet. You realize this is a blueprint for a future that hinges on a single clause buried in the fine print. Your eyes strain against the text’s illusions, but the letters twist into serpents, then into lullabies, then into the face of someone you once loved and lost. The leviathan desk groans, its ribs tightening like a corset, urging haste.  

A clock ticks somewhere, though time here is a myth. The walls pulse like a heartbeat. You spot it—a discrepancy in a footnote, a decimal point that quivers like an eyelash. Your hand trembles as the quill descends. Correcting it could save a billion lives; hesitating might doom them all. The ink resists, hissing like a scorned lover as you press the tip to the page.  

Suddenly, the cathedral shatters. Not in debris, but in sound—a symphony of collapsing dimensions. The document ignites in a flameless blaze, and you’re falling through a kaleidoscope of possibilities, each shard a life altered by your choice. You land in a field of dandelions that whisper *thank you* or *curse you*, depending on the reality. Above, the sky stitches itself back together, one star at a time.  

You wake with the taste of burnt honey on your tongue.
