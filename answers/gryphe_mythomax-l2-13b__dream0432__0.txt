I am dreaming. I am in a vast and lush forest, where the trees tower above me, reaching towards the sky with their leafy green branches. The ground beneath my feet is soft and spongy, covered in a thick carpet of moss. The air is heavy with the smell of earth and damp leaves. I can hear the sounds of birdsong and rustling foliage all around me.

Despite the beauty of my surroundings, I am experiencing a sense of scarcity. It feels as though there is not enough space for me to breathe, as if the trees are closing in on me, suffocating me. I am thirsty, but there seems to be no water to be found. The more I search, the more parched I become.

As I wander deeper into the forest, I stumble upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stands a glistening crystal fountain, its waters cascading down into a sparkling pool below. Relief washes over me as I approach the fountain. I kneel down and stick my hand in the cool water, taking a sip. It is the sweetest, most refreshing water I have ever tasted.

I drink deeply, my thirst quenched, and suddenly, the feeling of scarcity dissipates. I stand up, feeling lighter and more alive than before. I look around and realize that the forest doesn't feel claustrophobic anymore. Instead, it feels expansive, welcoming, and full of possibility. 

I walk back through the forest, taking in the sights and sounds with renewed appreciation. The trees no longer feel like they're closing in on me; instead, they seem to be reaching out, offering their support and guidance. The air is still heavy with moisture, but now it feels nourishing and revitalizing. 

I have seen through the perceptual distortion that led me to feel scarce, and I realize that abundance is all around me. The forest is teeming with life, and I am a part of it, connected to it in ways I never imagined.
