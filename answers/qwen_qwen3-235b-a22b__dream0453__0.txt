I am dreaming. I am standing in a world that is caught between breaths—between a heartbeat and the next. Around me, time is not a river but an ocean, rising and falling with the weight of emotion. The stars above pulse in sync with my own heartbeat. They flicker slow and golden when I feel at peace, and race like fireflies in a storm when I am afraid.

I step onto a bridge made of whispering memories, each plank underfoot murmuring fragments of forgotten lullabies. With each step, I grow younger, and the bridge behind me crumbles into butterflies, flying back into the past. I reach the other side and age ten years in an instant. The ground reconfigures itself into a library of seasons. Shelves stretch endlessly into the sky, and every book is a year in my life, but when I open one, the words bleed into watercolor paintings that shift as I relive the emotions.

I pick one book—burning red, with a heart where a clasp should be—and open it. I am falling into the memory of a heartbreak. Everything is cold and grey, but in the center of the scene glows the warmth of a final kiss. Time here is stretchy taffy—pulling the moment of goodbye into infinity, filling the air with slow motion and longing. With my presence, the scene rewinds and replays, not because I want it to, but because grief slows time so thickly that even the light struggles to pass through.

Then, with a blink, I'm laughing with a friend under a tree made of bells. Every time we laugh, the tree rings a different chime, and moments fly by like flocks of birds, the sky shifting from dawn to dusk in seconds. Here, in joy’s embrace, time is barely noticed—it flutters past like the wings of hummingbirds, dizzying and fast.

I wander the dreamlands, learning how emotion colors time like dyes in water. In love, time pools soft and deep, luminous with moments that stretch out like golden threads. In terror, it stretches incomprehensibly thin or snaps into fragments like shattered glass, each reflecting a different second. In wonder, time spirals—looping and curling as though trying to grasp the edges of the impossible.

At the farthest edge of the dream, I come to a mountain of frozen tears, impossibly tall. It is made of memories I’ve forgotten I ever carried. When I touch it, it begins to melt, and from its thawing core rise tiny, luminous creatures—memories becoming alive, emotions catching fire. They fly upward, into the skies of this strange realm, trailing vines made of seconds and minutes lost.

And then—without warning, as dreams so often do—I am weightless once more, floating in a void where there is no emotion, and so no time. Just silent space. I feel as though I drift for eternity, and yet, in truth, it is the blink of an eye: eternity neutralized in a breath.

Then—

I awaken, still carrying traces of that impossible ocean within, still tasting echoes of the stars whose rhythm matched my soul.

The sensation fades like the memory of a dream once heard but half-forgotten.

And yet… I know I was *inside* time itself, wrapped in its silken, shifting skin—tugged and turned by the pulse of feeling.

And if I close my eyes again, I might just find the way back.
