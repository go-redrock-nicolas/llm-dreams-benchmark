I am dreaming. I drift into a vast, pulsating cavern where the air itself seems to hum with expectation. Above me, swaying stalactites refract rainbow filaments of light; each glow pulses in time to an inaudible symphony. I sense two presences: the Sonari, winged creatures with velvet-black throats who speak only in complex, swirling chords; and the Luminari, translucent beings whose bodies ripple in cascading color-bursts instead of words.

You—my dreaming self—have been summoned to become the Bridge­weaver, the one who can translate song into kaleidoscopic radiance and vice versa. To bridge this fundamental gap, you conjure a crystalline lyre whose strings are spun from pure moonlight. At its heart sits a rotating prism, carved from meteoric quartz. Each vibration in the strings bends through the prism, fracturing into ribbons of colored flame; each lightpulse that strikes the prism resonates back into sound, a whisper of colorencoded melody.

As I pluck the first string, a low, sonorous note thunders through the cavern. The prism shudders, and a ghost-green streak of light arcs across the chamber. The Sonari hover, curious, their gossamer wings brushing the cave walls in soft timpani rhythms. The Luminari swirl forward, eyes flickering from emerald to sapphire, attempting to trace the light’s beat.

Gently, I coax the next note into being—a crystalline trill that splits into rose-gold sparks. In that moment, a Sonari throat flutters a complementary pitch that the prism captures and transforms into a mauve wave, lapping at the Luminari’s diaphanous forms. They respond with a slow, amber-pulsing glow, and the lyre absorbs it, humming back a deep, resonant chord that vibrates through every stalagmite and leaf of the glowing mushrooms carpeting the cave floor.

Time stretches and loops. Each new exchange grows richer: a sharp Sonari crescendo blooms into a shower of violet motes, which the Luminari sift and reshape into honeyed arcs. I guide them, adjusting the prism’s angle so their languages meld, each translation more fluid than the last. In the dream’s climax, the cavern itself joins in—stalactites hum, mushrooms flash, and the very walls shimmer with the shared tapestry of sound and light.

When I awaken from the dream, I carry with me a single, up-turned prism shard—its surfaces still alive with faint echoes of that impossible dialogue, proof that even the most alien tongues can learn to speak to one another.
