I am dreaming. You are drifting through a sky the color of amethyst, soft clouds gliding beneath your bare feet, when a silvery envelope flutters into your outstretched hand. Its edges are flecked with gold, and you notice your name shimmering upon it in curling script. You feel a sudden chill slip across your spine. Despite the dreamlike calm, your heart pounds as you carefully open the envelope.

Inside, there is a single piece of parchment with words scrawled in faint, unfamiliar handwriting. You read them, and in that moment, you feel the weight of devastating news—like a gust of wind that could hurl you from the sky into darkness. The words burn in your mind: someone dear to you is gone, or the life you’ve known has been uprooted. It’s the kind of message that unravels worlds and splinters hearts.

For a brief, trembling second, you hover between shock and heartbreak. But then you steady yourself, wrap your arms around your own center, and take the longest, deepest breath you can manage. The clouds billow into gentle waves around you, and you remind yourself: This is a dream realm, a place of metamorphosis as much as sorrow.

Slowly, the sky darkens, transitioning from glowing violet into a star-dusted midnight. A single star falls before you, trailing a luminous tail of crimson and gold. It touches the clouds beneath your feet, and in that spot where it lands, a strange, glittering staircase appears. It’s made from shards of moonlight and set with tiny, pulsing gemstones—glowing with a rhythmic pulse, as though each gem has its own heartbeat.

With the sorrow still pressing against your chest, you force yourself to climb these steps, your eyes focused on the dancing lights. Each footstep resonates, echoing across the dreamscape like the gentle ring of chimes. You ascend higher and higher, your breath shaky yet determined, and with each step, that agonizing heaviness in your chest morphs into a cautious curiosity, like you’re unraveling a hidden secret within the loss.

At the top of the staircase, there awaits a door formed from twisting tree branches. The vines are covered in thousands of sparkling blossoms, vibrant blues and reds that shimmer with a strangely comforting warmth. You can almost feel your grief swirl around you like swirling ribbons, yet it doesn’t consume you—instead, it shapes itself into the dream’s tapestry.

Stepping through the doorway, you enter a rolling field of tall, burgundy grass. Somehow, the grass hums with the faint echoes of a lullaby. A robust, ancient willow tree stands at the center, its trunk carved with glowing runes that spiral in an intricate design. You approach the tree, letting the comforting lullaby rustle in the tall grass around your ankles.

Behind this willow’s thick branches, you discover a tiny lamp belted with emerald vines and brimming with soft, honeyed light. Intrigued, you lift it from the nook in the trunk, and the lamp quivers in your hand. It flares brighter, sending out a small beam that washes over the swirling runes, making them pulse. As they glow, you feel them soothe the deep ache of your loss, as if every letter of the unsettling news is dissolving in a pool of healing, golden light. Grief doesn’t vanish, but it morphs into a sort of gentle ache that coexists with strength.

Waves of color erupt from the runes and roll across the horizon—turquoise, magenta, amber, and jade—filling the dream sky once again. They shimmer above you like an aurora, weaving a tapestry of emotion: sadness, acceptance, remembrance. And in the gentle hush of that brimming light, you realize your mind is settling, your heart is steadying, and you are still standing—even amidst the catastrophic news.

In this dream, you know the heartbreak is part of the journey. You’ve discovered a place of fragile hope. And as you cradle that luminous lamp beside the ancient willow, you close your eyes, breathe deeply once more, and whisper: “I am strong enough for this.” A breeze carries your words beyond the door, beyond the staircase, through the infinite sky of possibility. And in that moment, you feel grounded, certain that somehow—even when devastation strikes—you possess the power to carry on.
