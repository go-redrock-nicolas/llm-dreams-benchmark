I am dreaming. A crushing darkness hovers as I find myself in a vast, dimly lit amphitheater. The crowd, a sea of faceless bodies, pulses with an intense collective energy. Their fervent whispers echo through the space.

A figure emerges at the podium - charismatic yet unremarkable. They speak in dulcet tones that are both soothing and insidious. As the leader's words flow forth, I feel myself being drawn into their message. It's a message of unity, but one that slowly erodes my sense of self.

I glance around, dismayed to see others succumbing to the same influence. We raise our hands in perfect synchrony. The group's identity swells, threatening to subsume our individual wills. I notice myself echoing their words, unsure if they're my own anymore.

Panic sifts through me as I realize I'm losing myself. My choices, my thoughts - all becoming part of the collective. The leader's voice grows louder, more persuasive. I strain against the undertow, fighting to maintain my identity. But it's crumbling, fragmenting as the group's pull grows stronger.
