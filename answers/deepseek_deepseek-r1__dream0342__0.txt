I am dreaming. **Dream Sequence: The Whispering Waste**  

You’re standing in a kitchen that isn’t yours—or is it? The walls pulse faintly, breathing in hues of bruised violet and algae-green, as though the room itself is alive. A familiar scent wraps around you: the rich, roasted aroma of your daily coffee, brewed in those single-use pods you swear by. Convenient, quick, a small indulgence. But something’s wrong. The sleek metal pod in your hand squirms, its surface rippling like liquid mercury. When you drop it into the machine, it doesn’t click into place. Instead, it *screams*—a high, keening sound that splits the air.  

The machine gurgles, not brewing coffee but spewing a thick, iridescent sludge that pools on the countertop. It spreads, crawling toward your fingertips, and where it touches the laminate, the surface chars and crumbles into ash. You stumble back, but the sludge follows, morphing into shapes: skeletal trees, gasping fish, a child’s face smeared with soot. A voice, wet and grating, rasps from the muck: *“You didn’t look. You never look.”*  

Panicked, you flee into a hallway that stretches impossibly long, lined with mirrors. Each reflection shows a version of you holding a different disposable convenience—plastic bags ballooning like jellyfish in your grip, takeout containers oozing neon slime, batteries leaking acid that eats through your palms. The floor beneath you cracks, revealing a chasm where glittering trash avalanches into a void, and the air reeks of burnt plastic and rotting earth.  

Then, a flicker. A door appears, warped and overgrown with vines. You wrench it open to find a sunlit meadow, pristine but eerily silent. In the center, a single coffee plant grows, its branches heavy with pods that gleam like organic husks. A figure—faceless, shimmering—stands beside it. *“Choose,”* it hums, not with judgment, but sorrow.  

You reach for a pod, but this time, it dissolves in your hand, becoming soil that smells of rain and renewal. The meadow breathes, colors deepening, birdsong erupting from nowhere. Yet when you turn back, the hallway of horrors remains, a specter at the edge of this paradise.  

You wake gasping, your heartbeat a drumroll of guilt, the taste of metal and wildflowers still on your tongue.
