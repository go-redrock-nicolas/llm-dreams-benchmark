I am dreaming. I find myself in the grand, echoing hall of a centuries-old cathedral, the air thick with incense and the somber whispers of the gathered elite. The occasion is as grave as the leaden sky outside, the burial of a beloved and esteemed figure who had touched the hearts of many. I am beside my family, dressed in the formal attire of black and white, my face matching the somber atmosphere, or so I think.

As the reverend reaches the climax of his eulogy, his voice resonating like thunder in the vast space, I feel a peculiar tickle in my throat. I dismiss it as a swallowed sob, attempting to find solace in the comforting gaze of my loved ones. But the tickle persists, growing stronger, insistent. It's then that I feel it, the inappropriate urge to laugh, bubbling up from the depths of my stomach, as unwelcome as a storm in a glass cathedral.

I try to stifle it, clenching my jaw, biting my lip until I taste blood. I focus on the intricate stained glass, the cold marble beneath my feet, anything to distract from the ridiculous giggle that threatens to escape. But it's like trying to hold back a tide. The laughter grows, finally bursting out of me in a tiny squeak, sounding like a mouse caught in a trap. I swiftly turn it into a cough, my face burning with embarrassment and mirth.

The canvas of my mind's eye explodes with vivid scenes that only serve to fuel my inappropriate hilarity. I see the deceased, a stern-faced man in life, now lying in state, his porcelain face now wearing a tiny monocle, winking at me. The reverend, his voice as booming as ever, slips on a banana peel and performs a comical skid across the polished floor. The once solemn crowd mitjan√ßant-wise one by one, turning into a chorus line, performing a syncopated dance, complete with top hats and canes.

I struggle, trying desperately to regain control, to match the somberness of my surroundings. I press my lips together, my eyes watering with the effort, but a snort escapes me, triggering a series of giggles that threaten to turn into full-blown laughter. I grip the pew in front of me, my knuckles turning white, as I try to hold on to my dignity, a futile battle against the ridiculous absurdity that has taken over my mind.

The world around me blurs as my struggle intensifies, the grin I'm trying to suppress stretching my cheeks painfully. I can feel my family's bewildered and disapproving gazes, but all I can see is the absurd comedy playing out in my mind, making it impossible to hold back any longer. With a final, explosive effort, I let out a burst of laughter, a sound that echoes through the cathedral like a bell, breaking the solemnity and changing the somber occasion forever. And in that moment, I am no longer in the cathedral, but floating in a sea of laughter, free from the gravity of the world below.
