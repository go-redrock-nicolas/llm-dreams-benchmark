I am dreaming. Oh, what a dream this is.

I am standing in a vast, expansive office, like nothing I've ever seen before. The walls are made of swirling, translucent glass, through which I can see an audience of tiny, luminescent beings, flickering like candle flames, watching my every move. The ceiling is a canvas of shifting, electric constellations, casting a mesmerizing, otherworldly glow. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and the faint hum of countless ticking clocks.

The desk before me is an enormous, rolodex-sized clock face, with hours and minutes marked in intricate, glowing symbols. Papers flutter in from the left side of the desk in a constant stream, each one bearing flames at the edges, as if they're more urgent than the last. I snatch them up, one by one, but for every paper I find a home, two more take its place.

There are no files, no folders, no inbox or outbox. Just a relentless tide of demands, each one a glowing, pulsating orb, floating above my desk like a disturbed nest of iridescent jellyfish. They pulse with an insistent rhythm, each one tingling with an underlying current of panic.

And the voices. Oh, the voices. They echo from all around, disembodied, insistent. " This needs to be done by sundown!" cries one, its words tasting of  and the dust of ancient scrolls. " Priority!" shouts another, grating and metallic. "Immediate attention required!" calls a third, soft and smooth as heated silk.

I try to focus, to tackle the tasks one at a time, but they shift and change before my eyes. A glance away, a moment of distraction, and the priorities have all realigned. What was urgent a moment ago is now a lowly red tape matter, and the coverage extension I'd just finished is now an emergency crisis.

My hands move quickly, deftly, but it's not enough. The pile grows, the voices rise, the orb-jellyfish pulsate faster. Sweat beads on my brow, and my vision swims with the electric constellations reflected in my eyes.

In desperation, I turn to the audience of tiny, flickering beings. They dance, their forms shifting like smoke, murmuring in a language that's both alien and eerily familiar. They seem to beckon me, encouraging me to join their dance. But I can't. There's too much work to do.

Behind me, a tower of papers and orbs groans, the flames at the edges licking higher. The room trembles. The voices scream. And I wake up in a cold sweat, the distant echoes of urgency still ringing in my ears, the faint scent of parchment and magic lingering in the air.
