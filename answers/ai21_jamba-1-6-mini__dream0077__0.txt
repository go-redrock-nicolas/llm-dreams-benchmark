I am dreaming. You're leading a high-stakes mission, every detail pivotal. The team starts to falter with small errors. You stop in your tracks, pausing the operation, and gather everyone. Your voice is calm but firm as you steer the team back on course, addressing each mistake with clarity and reassurance. You then redirect your focus, ensuring every move is precise, leaving no room for doubt. You lead with unwavering confidence, turning the operation into a seamless success.
