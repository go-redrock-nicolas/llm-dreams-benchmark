I am dreaming. Breaking this attentional-capture pattern, you press your palms gently against the phantom glow of your wrist, and the buzzing stream of icons dissolves like morning mist. In that instant, the world around you blossoms into hyper-saturated hues. You stand at the edge of a vast meadow whose tall grasses sway in time with a melody only your heart can hear. Each blade of grass shimmers with dew that reflects not the sky above but distant galaxies, as though the universe itself kneels to whisper secrets in your ear.

With each steady breath, the air tastes of wild mint and distant rainstorms. The meadow gives way to a corridor of ancient trees, their bark alive with pulsating patterns of bioluminescent runes. You reach out and touch one rune—it ripples under your fingertips like silk—unlocking a pathway of floating lanterns. They drift before you like orange fireflies, guiding your steps deeper into this realm of awakened senses. As you follow them, time loosens its grip: seconds stretch into centuries, and the boundaries between past, present, and future folding into a single, ineffable moment.

At the corridor’s end, you emerge onto a shore where the sea glows with liquid silver. Every wave that laps at your feet carries a whisper—a lullaby of tides that remember the shape of every shore they’ve ever kissed. With curiosity unbound by digital pings, you wade into the water, feeling its cool electric pulse surge through you. The lantern-fireflies ascend above the waves, transforming into a constellation that mirrors your own beating heart. In this liquid mirror, you catch a glimpse of your truest self—undistracted, alight with wonder, and wholly, achingly present.
