I am dreaming. find myself floating in a cathedral woven of a thousand languages—a place neither fully earth nor sky, where stained glass memories shift and ripple with every heartbeat of those assembled. The two parties stand at opposite ends: one draped in cloaks of midnight indigo, eyes luminous with centuries of unmet longing; the other adorned in garlands of radiant ochre, voices carrying the thunder of ancestral pain. Between them yawns a river, shimmering with stories, its current restless and insistent.

Traditional methods: circles of dialogue, offerings of bread and salt, the ceremonial placing of hands upon the heart—these evaporate into mist, fragile as spider silk in a storm. Words cannot bridge this span; reason is a feather in a hurricane. The impasse hums like riven stone.

So I cast aside the scripts. Instead, I beckon the river itself. With hands woven from threads of possibility, I call forth dreamweavers: spectral figures who spin the memory of the land into the air above us, braiding together visions from each side's sorrow and triumph: a child's laughter breaking dawn on one shore, the silent tears at a grandmother's grave on the other. The river swells, and from it rises a mosaic of pain and hope, so vivid it seems everyone’s hearts beat within the same body for a moment.

Then, without speaking—I walk into the river, feeling history whirl about my ankles. I invite first one party and then the other to follow, to let the cool current carry their bitterness away in slow, swirling arcs. They step in, hesitant, the water cupping each memory like precious amber. As they wade into the heart of the dream-river, their reflections merge, colors bleeding together until indigo and ochre dissolve into a radiant twilight.

The river begins to sing—a low, thrumming hymn that is not one tongue but a fusion of all their ancestors' voices, a language more primal than speech. In this music, grudges wither, and empathy unfurls like a sapling from the silt.

Just as dawn crests the mosaic sky, I see both parties reach across the water, joining hands not in agreement but in shared recognition of their wounds and their humanity. In the dream, I realize conflict is not something to be resolved, but a river to be crossed—again and again, together.

And as the dream dissolves, I awaken with the taste of river-wind on my tongue, and a hope as deep and ancient as the shifting tides.
