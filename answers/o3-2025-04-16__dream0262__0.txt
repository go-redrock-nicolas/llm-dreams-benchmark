I am dreaming. I am dreaming…  

I open my eyes inside a cathedral made not of stone, but of slow-moving starlight. Beams of purple and teal radiance braid themselves into arches that breathe like giant, luminescent lungs. Every footfall sounds like a bell being struck underwater, soft and resonant, echoing off constellations suspended in midair. I know—because dreams let you know things without telling—that I have been summoned here to fashion something the universe has never witnessed, something that will rewrite its own rules the instant it is born.

Ahead, a council of faceless mentors floats upon thrones of liquid glass. They gesture—wordlessly, yet unmistakably—toward a dais where an object pulses behind gauzy veils. As I step closer, the veils shimmer aside on silent breezes, revealing…nothing. The platform is empty. Realization floods me: the canvas, the score, the blueprint—whatever creation is to come—must be exhaled directly from my imagination into reality, with no intermediary tools. Tradition itself has been banished from this cathedral of stars.

The moment I accept the task, rivers of color unfurl from my fingertips—threads of vermilion singing in a key I cannot name, ribbons of peridot humming in fractal chords, silver droplets chiming like nested wind chimes. The pigments and tones weave into a sculpture that floats, unfinished, inviting improvisation. Yet I feel the pull of convention—those invisible chains of “how it’s always been done”—lurking beyond the cathedral’s radiant walls. If I let them inside, the piece will calcify into predictability.

I close my eyes. In the boundless dark behind my eyelids, I envision a medium that fuses all others: music you can taste, architecture you can hear, poetry you can walk through. I imagine a spiral walkway of translucent syllables, each step a vowel that alters the melody floating overhead. I picture notes that glow warmer in the mouth than any spice, whose timbre thickens like molten chocolate as they linger on the tongue. I see walls that vibrate with rhythmic micro-fractures, so the entire edifice is both percussion and percussionist. An orchestra of synesthesia.

When I open my eyes again, the dream has obeyed my command. The cathedral stretches and warps, becoming the very thing I conceived. Letters turn to steps beneath my feet, the word “soar” arcing upward, the word “deeper” plunging below. Bass tones drum inside stained-glass ribs; honeyed trumpet phrases condense into crystals you can pluck and swallow, their flavor a bright brass citrus. Visitors—pure figments, yet vivid—enter the structure and shape it further with their own sensations: a child’s laugh becomes a skylight; an elder’s sigh settles into mossy bass relief along the columns. The creation is no longer mine alone; it is a living language of all senses at once, rewriting itself with every perception added.

For the council, this is blasphemy and revelation intertwined. I sense their shock, their wonder—and then, at last, their silent acquiescence. The cathedral’s starlight bows around the new poly-sensory labyrinth, acknowledging its ascension into accepted reality. Where there was once an empty dais, there now coils a shimmering Möbius of possibility, forever eating its own limits and birthing fresh ones.

A final resonance quivers through the dreamscape: the utter disappearance of “established conventions.” They are absorbed, not destroyed, their bones folded into the new creation like nutrients returning to fertile soil. Innovation and tradition fuse into a continuum rather than a feud. And just as the last bell-under-water tone fades, I feel the starlight arches dissolve, sucked into the luminous core of the work…leaving me in weightless darkness.

The council, the cathedral, my own body—all melt into the kaleidoscopic swirl. Yet a single line of a new, unsung language remains, glowing in mid-air:

“Everything begins again—only brighter this time.”

I inhale—and wake.
