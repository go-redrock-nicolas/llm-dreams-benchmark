I am dreaming.

A golden twilight spreads across the sky, as if the sun chose to linger just a bit longer before slipping away. I find myself on a vast plain of tall, gently swaying grass, each blade glittering with flecks of stardust—like the entire realm is distilled from the potent magic of possibility. Warm breezes swirl around me, carrying the scent of burnt sugar and blooming night jasmine. My lungs fill with it, and in that sweet breath, I recall the darkest moment of my waking life—a time of loss and disbelief so profound that it felt impossible to move forward.

Yet here I am, standing tall, each step as effortless as a breath of wind across these glittering fields. Against all odds, I have soared beyond what once appeared unscalable. My heart throbs with a deliberate, triumphant pulse, a steady reminder that I didn’t merely endure; I grew. With every footstep rustling the luminescent grass, I sense once-broken fragments of fear scattering into the cosmos. There is no trace of the old dread in this mesmerizing landscape—only a calm surety that I possess a boundless capacity to heal.

A gentle rustling stirs at the edge of the horizon, and a procession of translucent horses begins to approach, their manes rippling like auroras in a sky of ten thousand constellations. They gallop closer, carrying shafts of moonlight where you’d expect saddles to be. One of them stops directly in front of me, bowing its head with a regal grace. I place a hand upon its side. The horse’s form vibrates with the quiet power of renewal, and as I accept this silent invitation, I swing myself up, courage burning in my veins.

We bound across the plains in fearless strides, each hoofbeat echoing with the reminders of my own resilience. Flecks of starry light burst from beneath the horse’s hooves like silent fireworks. The night sky blazes alive above me, galaxies and shooting stars swirling into an ever-changing mural. My chest feels wider than it ever has before, expanded by the fresh knowledge that even the greatest setbacks can be catalysts for unimaginable transformation. And in my dream, I know I have taken flight—heading toward boundless vistas of possibility, infused with awe for the unbreakable spirit I never knew I possessed.
