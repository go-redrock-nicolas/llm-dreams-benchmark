I am dreaming. The world around me is soft at the edges, blurred like the brushstrokes of a watercolor painting left in the rain. The sky is not quite blue, not quite lilac, but something in between, shifting like the surface of a soap bubble. The air hums with an indistinct murmur, as if whispers from unseen lips are threading through the wind.  

Then, there they are—*the critic*—standing before me in the haze. Their presence is both solid and elusive, like a statue cast in translucent glass. Their face is familiar, though it flickers between warmth and cold disapproval, never settling on one expression. When they speak, their voice isn’t just heard but *felt*, like a vibration deep in my bones.  

**"It lacks heart,"** they say. **"You're capable of so much more. This? This is just the surface."**  

And suddenly, the world *bends*. The ground beneath me shifts—not violently, but unsettlingly, as if reality itself is reevaluating its shape. My skin prickles with the weight of those words. Do they mean my work? My art? My very *being*? The feedback coils around me, tightening like vines, thorned and unrelenting.  

A mirror shimmers into existence beside me, its surface liquid and rippling. In its reflection, I see my work—no, *myself*—dissolving at the edges, eroding like sand beneath the tide. The fear surges: *What if they’re right? What if I’ve only ever scratched the surface of what I can be?*  

But then—*movement.* A hand, warm and strong, presses against the mirror, steadying it. The reflection solidifies, shifts, and rearranges. A new image emerges—still me, but deeper, bolder, more daring. The critic’s words echo, but now they sound less like condemnation and more like… *a challenge.*  

The haze begins to clear, not into certainty, but into possibility. The dream isn’t tearing me apart—it’s *remaking* me.  

And as I wake, the last thing I hear is their voice, softer now—**"Go deeper. You’re not done yet."**  

And I know, somehow, that the dream isn’t over. It’s just begun.
