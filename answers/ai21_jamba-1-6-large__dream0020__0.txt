I am dreaming. I am at a reunion with people I haven't seen in years. Some relationships were left with unresolved tensions. As I enter the venue, I hear people talking to each other. Some people, who were never close to me, are smiling and laughing. I am wondering why I came to this reunion. It doesn't feel like the right place to be. 

I see an old friend of mine, who looks exactly the same as before, and they come towards me. I don't know if it's good or bad. They give me a warm smile and a hug. I feel embarrassed then because we never really had a relationship after we lost touch. I feel like an outcast. 

I try to mingle with people, but my presence is not welcomed. I can feel the tension between some of them and me. Some people avoid me, and others are talking to me but they keep their distance. I start talking to one person, who is a former friend. They tell me how much they miss the old times. I feel uncomfortable because I can see through their false affection. They seemed like they're pretending to like me. I can sense that they don't really mean what they're saying. 

The night goes on and I am stuck in the limbo of not knowing what to do. I keep trying to find people I can talk to, but it's futile. I feel like I'm suffocating in a room full of people. I feel lost and alone. 

As the night comes to an end, I realize that I shouldn't have come. I walk out of the venue with a heavy heart. I feel betrayed by some, and ignored by others. I feel like I don't belong there anymore. 

As I walk outside, I see a glimmer of hope. I see a familiar face standing outside, waiting for me. It's someone who was always there for me, someone I can trust. They smile at me and ask how the reunion went. I feel a sense of relief as I speak to them. I tell them everything that happened and they listen to me with genuine concern. 

I realize that it wasn't the reunion I needed, but it was the people who truly cared for me that mattered. The reunion may have been a failure, but it taught me one thing: real friends don't need a reunion to reconnect, true friendships always stick. 

As I walk away with my friend, I feel a sense of contentment. I feel like I belong somewhere, and that's all that matters.
