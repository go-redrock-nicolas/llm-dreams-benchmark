I am dreaming.

I find myself awash in an orange-green twilight, standing at the edge of a vast crystalline plain that hums with soundless energy. The sky above is a rippling canvas of shifting colors, as if painted by a sentient aurora—layers of amethyst and teal undulating in time with an invisible cosmic heartbeat. The air is thick but not suffocating, scented with something sharp and metallic, tinged with the sweetness of unfamiliar blossoms.

Gravity is a suggestion here, not a rule. My footsteps send me gliding in long, graceful arcs, as if walking on clouds spun thin by forgotten gods. Each stride takes me farther than expected. I lift my arms and, without intention, begin to drift—weightless, floating just above the surface, trailing gentle ripples of green light beneath me.

The ground itself is made of translucent hexagonal tiles that chime softly when touched. Beneath, subcutaneous rivers of liquid gold pulse gently, illuminating my path. Strange flora rise from the earth: towering glass reeds that sway with a slow, musical resonance, their tips adorned with glowing orbs that pulse in time with my racing heartbeat.

Creatures emerge from the mist—delicate beings with silvery, diaphanous wings and elongated bodies that refract the strange light like prisms. They are curious, floating closer, peering at me with opalescent eyes. Their voices enter my mind directly, not as words but as waves of emotion: welcome, curiosity, and delight.

Breathing here requires something different—a deliberate flexing of the chest that sends shivers of adaptation down my spine. My skin begins to tingle and shimmer, morphing to filter the air's exotic particles, turning a radiant shade of pale violet. I discover that by focusing on the ever-present hum, I can tune my senses, perceiving currents of energy and intention flowing through this alien realm.

At the horizon, an ocean of light, not water, laps hungrily at the edge of the plain. Its waves are slow, luminous tides whispering ancient songs. Drawn forward, I dip my hand into the shining surf and feel memories—not my own, but fragments of this planet’s consciousness: star-born storms, crystal gardens blooming in darkness, and the laughter of beings dancing low across moonscapes.

To survive here, I surrender—abandoning Earthborn habits, letting myself adapt, flowing with the new rhythms. I become a traveler of possibility, growing wings of shimmering thought, launching myself skyward into the dreaming heart of this world, where up and down swirl together and marvels await with every gentle, gravity-defying leap.
