I am dreaming. …stand upon the humming glass walkway of the Interflection Port, its surface refracting a spectrum of improbable colors beneath my boots. All around, the air vibrates with a subtle electric anticipation, as if the world is holding its breath for me. Selected—me, of all people—for a mission carved from the outlandish edge of possibility, where experts whisper about “impossibility” in awed tones. Their doubts fuel something bright and wild inside my chest.

As I move toward the arched portal, my pulse thrumming in harmony with the deep, organ-like tones resonating from the crystalline walls, I see my reflection flicker between infinite versions of myself: brave and terrified, burdened and soaring, a thousand dreams poised at a threshold. My suit is woven from shimmering, shift-cloth threads—protection against whatever unknowns lie ahead. Engineers, their eyes gleaming with a mix of fear and hope, adjust delicate devices humming at my wrists and temples.

Stepping into the transition chamber, I glimpse a vast map unfurling in holographic light. Swirling galaxies, winding wormholes, and unlabeled regions of darkness: the Uncharted Veil. My mission, inscribed in silver script across the void, is deceptively simple—“Navigate where reality unravels. Bring back a beacon of the impossible.”

A final warning chimes through the intercom, each word echoing like prophecy. “No one has returned from the Border Beyond. Trust your instincts more than your instruments. Be ready to meet the unknown.”

The portal dilates before me, a luminous eye blinking open, and the air suddenly smells of ozone and wildflowers. I step through—and gravity does something strange, twisting like a ribbon. Space becomes a river, and I am swept into a riot of color, sound, and sensation, each impossible and beautiful in ways that spin my mind and stretch my heart.

Now the mission truly begins.
