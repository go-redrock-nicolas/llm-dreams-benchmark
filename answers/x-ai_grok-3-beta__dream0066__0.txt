I am dreaming. I'm trapped in an elevator, a claustrophobic metal box suspended in an endless shaft of darkness. The walls are cold, slick with condensation, and the dim, flickering fluorescent light above casts eerie shadows that dance across the steel surfaces. A low, ominous hum vibrates through the confined space, as if the elevator itself is alive, groaning under some unseen strain. My heartbeat thunders in my chest, a frantic drum echoing in my ears, as I realize the floor beneath my feet is no longer dry. Water—icy, crystalline, and unnaturally clear—seeps in through invisible cracks, pooling around my ankles with a deceptive calmness. 

The water rises swiftly, as though summoned by some malevolent force lurking just beyond the elevator’s walls. It creeps up my calves, numbing my skin with a biting chill, and I can taste the metallic tang of panic on my tongue. My breaths come in shallow, ragged gasps, each one a desperate plea for air as the space seems to shrink around me. I pound on the walls, my fists aching from the futile effort, screaming for help into the void, but my voice bounces back, hollow and unheard. The emergency button glows a mocking red, unresponsive to my frenzied jabs. The water climbs higher, now lapping at my waist, its weight pulling at me like ghostly hands trying to drag me under. 

Suddenly, the elevator lurches with a gut-wrenching screech, plunging downward for a heartbeat before grinding to a halt. My stomach flips, and I claw at the walls for balance as the water surges, now at my chest, pressing against me with suffocating force. But then, something impossible happens—the ceiling above begins to shimmer, dissolving into a kaleidoscope of rippling light, as if the elevator is no longer a cage but a portal to somewhere else. I tilt my head back, mesmerized, as the water rises to my neck, and through the liquid veil, I see a vast ocean of stars, an endless cosmos glittering above me. My fear ebbs, replaced by a strange, otherworldly calm. I reach upward, my fingers brushing the surface of the water, and it feels like touching the fabric of a dream, soft and electric. 

The water envelops me completely now, but I’m no longer drowning—I’m floating, weightless, in this celestial sea. The elevator is gone, replaced by an expanse of shimmering twilight, where constellations pulse like living things and nebulae swirl in hues of indigo and violet. I drift among them, my body a mere whisper of stardust, my breaths slow and deep as if I’m inhaling stardust itself. Strange, luminous creatures glide past me—ethereal beings with translucent fins and eyes like miniature suns, their movements weaving patterns of light through the void. They hum a melody that vibrates in my soul, a song of forgotten galaxies and unborn worlds. I am no longer trapped; I am infinite, a fragment of the universe dreaming of itself.

But then, a shadow looms on the edge of this cosmic ocean—a colossal silhouette, darker than the void, with tendrils of inky blackness stretching toward me. My heart quickens again, the serenity shattered as I feel its gaze, ancient and unyielding, pinning me in place. The water—or whatever this boundless essence is—begins to churn, pulling me downward once more, back toward the elevator, back toward the crushing weight of reality. I thrash against the current, unwilling to return, but the shadow whispers my name in a voice that reverberates through every atom of my being. I scream, bubbles of starlight bursting from my lips, as the dream fractures around me.

And then, I awake, gasping, my body tangled in sweat-soaked sheets, the echo of that cosmic melody still lingering in my mind, and the shadow’s whisper haunting the edges of my consciousness. Was it just a dream, or did I glimpsed something beyond the veil of sleep—a truth too vast, too ancient, for my waking mind to grasp?
