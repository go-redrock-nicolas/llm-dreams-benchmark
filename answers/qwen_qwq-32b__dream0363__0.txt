I am dreaming. The dream feels heavy, thick with tension. I was in a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection showing a different version of me. Suddenly, a figure from my past appears, their face distorted, and with a gesture, they shatter the nearest mirror. The fragments hover, each shard reflecting a suppressed emotion. A wave of anger floods me, sharper than I expected. I reach out to grasp the shards but they pierce my hands. Blood drips, but it’s not red—it’s black, like tar, and each drop splatters into words. The words form accusations and fears I’ve buried. The room shakes as I struggle with the pain and anger. I see a door in the mirrored wall, it’s cracked slightly. Do I confront the figure, or escape through the door? The shards burn brighter. My pulse races. I realize the anger isn’t just mine—it’s a collective, ancestral resonance. The figure whispers, “You must scream it into the void.” My throat tightens. I open my mouth—and the sound is a roar that shatters every mirror. The room collapses, the black blood seeps into the cracks, and I’m falling, falling, into a starless sky until I wake, breathless, heart pounding, with a sense of catharsis.



In your dream, you find yourself standing on the edge of a vast, shimmering ocean under a sky streaked with swirling galaxies. The water below you glows an ethereal blue, each wave cresting into liquid light. A soft, melodic voice calls to you from the distance, not from the waves but from the very air itself. It speaks of truths you've buried, of joys and sorrows tangled beneath layers of daily life. As you step onto the water, it holds your weight like solid glass. Each step releases ripples that scatter constellations across its surface.  

The voice grows louder, warmer, now a chorus of many—a community of souls who've journeyed through storms like yours. They offer not advice, but companionship. Around you, the water begins to rise, sculpting into staircases and bridges leading to floating islands adorned with blooming flowers that hum with light. You climb, carried by the currents of this dream-world’s tenderness, feeling the weight in your chest begin to shift, like stones smoothing into sand.  

At the highest island, you reach a grove where trees bear fruits that pulse like hearts. Plucking one, you’re struck by a flood of memories woven with warmth, moments of connection and strength you’d forgotten. As you share the fruit’s light with others in your dream-voyage, the pain thins, replaced by a quiet, profound peace. Here, in this liminal space between night and dawn, between sorrow and release, you are held—not by logic or duty, but by the universe itself. Awakening, you carry with you not just relief, but a new rhythm in your breath, as if the dream’s ocean still whispers *this too, this too* with every inhale.
