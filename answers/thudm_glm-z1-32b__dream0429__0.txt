I am dreaming. The sky is in flames, and it’s raining sapphires. My Converse sneakers tread a path through a meadow of swirling topazes, each step strewn with petals that are actually guitar strings. I stand at a crossroads where every road is a river of liquid mercury, each current flowing toward a different memory. I Approach the left river, which is the color of burnt toast, and dip my fingers into it. The current pulls away, revealing a submerged castle made entirely of music sheets, their bars and notes singing a requiem of things left unsaid. Above me, a flock of mechanical doves materializes, recording machines with beaks of cogs and wings of parchment. One lands on my shoulder and whispers lyrics from a song I composed in kindergarten and immediately forgot. Its data feathers rustle against my tangled morning glory hair, and suddenly, I am remembering everything—the whispers in the bathroom stalls, the half-hearted apologies, the times I said “I’m okay” with my lungs on fire. As the whoosh of unrepressed laughter lifts me off my boots, the mercury rivers freeze into mirror-like ice, and now each road reflects a different reciprocal. If I walk towards the castle, I’ll have to confront my village chief and tell him my ten-year-old secret. If I follow the path to the right, a tower of soap bubbles waits—each containing a momento from someone else’s life I try to claim as my own. The mechanical doves circle higher, their wingspan knitting the sky with constellations of my own voice. They’re chanting the chorus from the song I never finished, the bridge where I promise to stop breaking things just to see if the pieces fit. The sapphire rain intensifies, and for a moment, I wonder if this isn’t just a vivid dream but a recalibration of what’s real. Then the doves disintegrate into sand, and I wake up with a pen in my hand, a pillow drenched in ink, and the faint taste of mercury on my tongue.
