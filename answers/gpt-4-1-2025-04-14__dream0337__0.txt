I am dreaming.

I find myself adrift in a place that shimmers with the light of a thousand unfamiliar stars. The land before me is stitched together from the colors of dusk—deep purples, amber streaks, emerald shadows—each hue swelling with a meaning I cannot put into words. I stand at the edge of a sprawling bazaar, canopies like sails flapping high above, their fabrics patterned with symbols I do not recognize. The air is thick with intoxicating aromas: spiced honey, roasted chestnuts, and fruits I cannot name.

Everywhere, people move in currents—a woman spinning in a circle with scarves that flutter like butterflies; a stoic old man playing an instrument crafted from glass and wind. Their voices rise and fall like rivers, a language both mesmerizing and impossibly tangled. I open my mouth to speak, but my tongue stutters over foreign syllables, the meaning lost in my throat.

Panic prickles at the edge of my mind, but then a child with eyes the color of new leaves approaches, offering a palm full of luminous stones. I kneel and smile, placing my hand over my heart. The child beams, demonstrating: stone to palm, bow of the head, a gentle exhale—thank you, I realize, a gesture older than speech. Around me, I begin to see more: a merchant pressing a token to her lips and extending it; shoppers tracing circles in the air to indicate confusion, or sweeping both hands outward in a gesture of gratitude. 

I mimic, I watch, I learn. Soon, conversation blooms in gestures and glances: a raised eyebrow, a tilt of the head, fingers splayed over the chest to signal sincerity. The world becomes a living tapestry of meaning beyond words—every smile, every nod, every outstretched hand another thread weaving me deeper into the fabric of this place. 

And as I float through the market, I realize I’m not lost, but home in the unspoken. Here, hearts speak most fluently of all.
