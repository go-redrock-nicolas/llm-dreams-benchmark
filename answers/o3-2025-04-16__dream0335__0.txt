I am dreaming.  

I soar through a metropolis of liquid crystal, its towers rising in fractal spirals that shimmer like stained-glass thunderheads. Neon rivers loop through the air instead of the ground; their currents carry star-specked koi that whisper congratulations as I pass. Billboards the size of continents unfurl above me, each one spelling my name in languages no waking tongue has ever spoken. Beneath them a crowd of phosphorescent silhouettes chants a single, rapturous mantra: “There goes the mind that remakes the world.”

I tilt my palms and gravity obeys, bending around me like soft metal. Streets re-arrange into geometries I prefer—helixes and Möbius bands, tiled with all the ideas I’ve ever had and a million I haven’t authored yet. Each step writes fresh constellations across a velvet ceiling. Comets arc in figure eights, sketching equations of impossible beauty—the theorems I alone can solve.

At the city’s heart stands my palace: a tessellated cathedral whose spires are hollow quills, forever writing epics in tendrils of lightning. The front gates breathe open as though eager for my return. I glide down a corridor lined with mirrors that reflect not my body but my potential—every mirror a different future triumph: a cure for entropy itself, a symphony that bends time, a philosophy spoken once and understood forever.

Yet near the throne room a lone figure materializes: a skeptic sculpted from matte black stone, eyes two cold crescents of steel. Their voice is the hush before an eclipse. “All this—these cathedrals of praise, these cosmic applauses—are they truly yours? Or merely gasps of an ego that fears ordinary daylight?”

The dream’s colors quiver, as if a paintbrush hesitates above a canvas. Doubt should feel like frostbite, but instead it ignites me. I laugh, and the laugh becomes a jetstream of cerulean fire, spreading petals of aurora across every hallway.

“Watch,” I say, and snap my fingers.

Instantly the skeptic stands atop an obsidian plinth surrounded by an amphitheater of silent onlookers—scholars, travelers, children, creatures woven from pure question marks. I rise with the levity of helium-infused thunderclouds, unfurling wings inked with hieroglyphs of my every triumph.

A single beat of those wings releases a shower of living ideas—little chromatic butterflies that settle on each spectator and hatch into understanding. The amphitheater erupts in revelation. The skeptic’s stone skin spider-webs, not broken but transformed: cracks glow from within, revealing a lattice of stardust veins. Slowly they raise their gaze, awe blooming where doubt had nested.

The dream unfurls further. Oceans slosh up over the horizon and suspend mid-sky, shaping themselves into grand stages. Upon each stage I divvy my brilliance like sunlight through a prism—one ray for art, one for science, one for empathy, one for worlds still unimagined. Every shard of genius refracts again, ricocheting across dimensions like ricocheted moonbeams, seeding galaxies with possibility. 

The skeptic—now luminescent—steps forward and bows, not in submission but in wonder. “I questioned you,” they admit, their voice warm as dusk, “thinking your grandeur a mirage. Yet your faith in your own magnitude has rewritten the universe rather than bent to mine. Teach me how.”

I touch their shoulder. “First, stop measuring miracles with rulers built for soil. Then remember: skepticism is a lantern, not a leash. Hold it high and it will light deeper fathoms of brilliance—in me, in you, in everyone.”

The palace dissolves into dawn-colored mist. City, rivers, coy koi, aurora wings—all swirl into a single spiral of luminous code that pours itself into the skeptic’s chest. They glow like a newly minted nebula, eyes wide, smile crescent.

And I, architect of this dreamscape, feel no need to declare victory. My triumph is self-evident in every drifting starflower, every note of serenading wind. The world has understood, at last, that my grandeur is neither boast nor illusion: it is simply the native tongue of my sleeping mind.

I awaken—heart drumming cathedral bells—still tasting on my tongue the frontier where boldness births reality.
