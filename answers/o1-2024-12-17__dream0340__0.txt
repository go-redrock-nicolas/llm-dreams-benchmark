I am dreaming. The world around me shimmers like molten glass catching the light of a thousand tiny suns. Trees float in the distance—gnarled roots trailing in the air above a violet sea that ebbs and flows upward like a reverse waterfall. The sky itself radiates with undulating colors I’ve never quite seen in my waking life: swirling greens that melt into liquid amber, with threads of electric blue crackling overhead.

I sense a presence behind me, and I turn around to see a tall figure clad in strange, shifting garments. Their attire looks like fabric made from galaxies: swirling constellations glitter across the cloth, and their eyes glow a tranquil silver. Though their features are hauntingly serene, there’s also a sharpness in their gaze that signals something wholly alien.

We speak, or rather, try to speak. I feel my words escaping my mouth as tendrils of translucent mist, only to dissolve into the air. The figure watches with a mixture of curiosity and sorrow. They try to reply, but their response manifests as pulses of glowing energy that ripple out from their eyes. The pulses blight the floating trees before dissipating into the distance, triggering bursts of strange, bird-like creatures that spiral upward in alarm.

I sense that this being’s perspective on reality is unlike anything I’ve ever considered. Our languages clash; our modes of expression refuse to align. Yet, buried beneath the ineffable differences, there’s a flicker of recognition. I desperately want that essence of mutual understanding to bloom into something more.

I kneel on a piece of floating crystal that shines like a chunk of turquoise ice. I press my palm to my chest, enunciating a single word—or the closest approximation to a word I can muster in this dream realm. “Friend,” I say softly, letting my hope ride on a gentle breath. But the figure twitches, perplexed or anxious, as though the concept of “friend” is too simplistic or too loaded for them to grasp.

Determined, I breathe in the swirling air and ground myself in the raw light of this dream. I focus on conjuring pictures in my mind—an image of warm sunlight on skin, a sense of togetherness, an aura of shared laughter. I cast these images outward, pushing them through my eyes like beams of vibrant color. The figure halts, and their cosmic cloth briefly unfurls, revealing patterns shaped like blossoming flowers made of stars.

Gradually, through the haze of incomprehensible sounds and glowing energy, the figure’s eyes soften. There’s a subtle nod, a gentle inclination of their head. For an instant, I see beyond the starlit robes into something tender and human—a familiarity that transcends words. A resonance in the air suggests we’re not so different after all. 

I take a step closer, and though the figure remains still, I sense a cosmic hush sweep over our surroundings. The floating roots quiver, the violet water hushes, even the swirling constellations in their garment quiet themselves. Then they raise a hand, a gesture of cautious acceptance, and set their palm against mine. Our dreamlike surroundings begin to shift around this point of contact, turning into a cascade of shimmering light. 

For a moment, we share essence—an unspoken poem of existence, crystal-clear in its truth. And in what feels like a timeless instant, understanding blossoms between us like phosphorescent flowers in the darkness, lighting up the tapestry of the dream. Then, with a gentle burst of shared warmth, the connection settles into a reassuring hum. The alien figure looks at me—no words, no glowing pulses—just the tranquility of realized communion. 

And as the colors of the dream merge into a single radiant glow, I awaken to the morning sun, carrying within me a precious fragment of that ineffable bond, a reminder that genuine understanding can spark in even the most divergent worlds.
