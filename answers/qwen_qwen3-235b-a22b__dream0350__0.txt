I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the universe itself is tuning an invisible instrument. You float—not in space, but through it—your body a thread of stardust unraveling and rewinding with every breath. Below you, a landscape shimmers into being: forests of crystalline trees whose leaves are liquid mirrors, reflecting not your face, but your *soul*—a swirling mosaic of forgotten childhood laughter, half-formed poems, and the scent of rain on a street you’ve never walked. Above, the sky is a kaleidoscope of liquid mercury clouds, each droplet a tiny prism refracting memories you’ve never lived yet somehow recognize.  

You reach out, and the horizon bends toward you, folding like origami into shapes that pulse with meaning. A river materializes beneath your feet, not of water, but of glowing, viscous ink that writes and rewrites itself in real time. The words are alive—serpentine calligraphy that coils into birds, then dissolves into whispers. *“Create,”* they murmur, their voices the rustle of parchment and the crackle of static. *“Create, and you will become.”*  

You begin to sculpt. With a flick of your wrist, a mountain erupts in slow motion, its peaks blooming into lotus flowers the size of cities. Each petal unfurls to reveal entire civilizations: one forged from sound, where inhabitants communicate through symphonies of their own heartbeat; another built from shadows, its towers shifting like smoke whenever light dares to touch them. You laugh, and the sound fractures into a thousand fireflies, each carrying a fragment of an idea—a story, a song, a half-remembered dream of flight.  

Time unravels here. Past and future collide in a carnival of paradox. You see yourself as a child, building sandcastles on a beach made of clock hands, and as an old woman, weaving constellations into a tapestry that maps the birth and death of stars. The two versions of you lock eyes across the chasm of years, and in that gaze, you feel the weight of every choice, every *what if*, collapse into a single, radiant truth: *You are the architect of infinite possibilities.*  

Suddenly, the ground beneath you shifts—a living mosaic of bioluminescent moss that pulses in rhythm with your thoughts. It forms a labyrinth, its walls breathing, alive with eyes that blink open and shut in time with a heartbeat not your own. You run, not in fear, but in exhilaration, each step triggering a burst of color that stains the air like spilled wine. The maze opens into a cathedral of trees whose roots plunge into galaxies, their branches cradling moons that weep silver tears.  

At the center stands a mirror—not glass, but liquid time—its surface rippling with the faces of everyone you’ve ever been. You touch it, and the reflection shatters into a flock of paper cranes, each inscribed with a name you’ve forgotten. They soar into the sky, which splits open like an egg, revealing a core of pure, unfiltered *potential*. It’s blinding, beautiful, unbearable—a light that contains every color, every sound, every emotion that has ever existed or ever will.  

And then, silence.  

You wake, gasping, your mind still tangled in the residue of the dream. Your hands tremble, stained with stardust. On the desk beside you, a single crane rests, its wings etched with a word you can’t quite read—but you know, deep in your bones, that it’s the answer to a question you’ve been asking your whole life.
