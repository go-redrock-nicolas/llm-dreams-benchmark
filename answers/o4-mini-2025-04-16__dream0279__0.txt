I am dreaming. You slip deeper into sleep, and suddenly you stand atop a slick obsidian plain under a sky the color of bruised sapphires. The hurdle you’ve just faced—a wall of living smoke that spat back every blow you struck—lies shattered at your feet, its remnants drifting skyward like ash. A gentle wind ripples the dark mirror of the ground, carrying the faint scent of jasmine and burnt parchment. In that moment you realize the obstacle didn’t defeat you; it transmuted you.

As you step forward, each footprint blossoms into a burst of pale gold light. The air hums, and from the horizon a colossal tree unfurls, its trunk a spiraling mosaic of mother-of-pearl and silver veins. Its branches twist into impossible loops, dripping with lantern-berries that pulse like heartbeats. When you reach out to pluck one, the fruit hums back—a low note that resonates through your bones—and splashes violet juice across the sky, painting distant clouds with bursts of thunderous indigo.

Beyond the tree, you spot a roiling river of quicksilver. No bridge spans its gleaming surface, but as you hesitate, a boat shaped like a heron’s wing drifts silently toward you. Its prow glints with tiny runes: symbols of courage, perseverance, and hope. You climb aboard, your hand brushing the carved wood, and feel warmth flood your chest. The river parts willingly, and you glide past glinting fish made of starlight, each one leaving a trail like scattered diamonds in its wake.

On the far bank rises a dark amphitheater hewn from crystallized night. At its center sits an arched doorway, flanked by statues of silent sentinels whose eyes glow with phosphorescent tears. You approach and press your palm against the cool stone. The door swings open on inaudible hinges, revealing a chamber where the air tastes like sunrise. In the center of the room hovers a single, perfect lotus aflame with iridescent fire. You close your eyes and inhale deeply—its petals unfurl inside your mind, filling every chamber with light. And in that instant you know: this goal you have chased through smoke and shadow was never beyond your reach. It was always the fire that lived within you, waiting for these final seeds of trial to set it free.
