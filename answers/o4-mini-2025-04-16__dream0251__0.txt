I am dreaming. You are dreaming. You stand alone in a vast auditorium whose walls ripple like liquid mercury. Every surface reflects your own face—but each reflection is subtly different: one trembles with fear, another sneers in contempt, a third weeps silent tears. In your hand rests the sheaf of notes for the presentation that could launch your career—or shatter it forever.

As your anxiety intensifies with each passing minute, you feel the lectern grow taller, looming above you like a monolith. The floor beneath your feet shifts from hardwood to glass, so you peer into an impossibly deep chasm. From below, a chorus of phantom voices murmurs your worst doubts:  
 • “You’ll forget the key points.”  
 • “They’re already judging you.”  
 • “This is your make-or-break moment—and you’re not ready.”

A sudden downpour begins—only it’s not rain, but tiny shards of paper fluttering from the ceiling. Each scrap bears a criticism you’ve ever heard: “Too nervous,” “Not polished enough,” “Wish you’d practiced more.” They swirl around you like confetti of condemnation until the auditorium transforms into a vast library whose shelves pulse with living thoughts. Books open themselves, pages flipping to passages that spotlight every past slip-up: a stutter here, a fumbled handshake there.

Fighting to steady your breath, you walk down an aisle lined with doorways. Every door crackles with the electricity of expectation. Through one you glimpse your future self onstage, triumphant; through another, defeat and embarrassment writ large. Your heart hammers: you know the wrong choice could seal your fate. Time stretches. You hear a clock toll—seven, eight, nine—the final chime echoing as if announcing your doom.

Then something shifts. You notice a single book on a pedestal, its spine unmarked. Drawn by a force softer than fear, you open it. The pages are blank—radical emptiness. In that silent space, you feel your chest unclench. You close your eyes and whisper to yourself: “I’ll write my own story.” The auditorium brightens as if dawn has swept away the storm. The phantom voices fall silent. The monstrous glass floor re-solidifies into warm wood.

When you finally step onto the stage in your dream, the spotlight no longer scorches but bathes you in gentle light. You grasp the microphone—and instead of faltering, you begin to speak. Each word lands with quiet power. Faces in the crowd lean in, riveted. The mercury walls smooth into mirrors of possibility: reflections of someone poised, confident, and entirely—yourself.
