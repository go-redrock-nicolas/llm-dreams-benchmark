I am dreaming. I find myself in a place of deep nostalgia, an alternate version of a childhood memory when I would visit my grandparents in the southern countryside. I’m walking through an ornate garden, with tall grasses, flowers of the brightest reds and yellows, cheerful and pristine against a backdrop of a pale-lilac sky. This is a version of a memory that feels both peaceful and reflective, where the garden exists as though to preserve a moment in perfection. It smells faintly of fresh rain and blooming roses that sweetly linger.

As I wander along the path of soft earth and weeds, I begin to notice the faint, eerie pull of an unseen orchestra, its strings ominous, yet comforting. The song is faint at first, then echoes louder, almost sounding as if a symphony is playing from another time, just for me. Even in this dream-like state, I know the song feels out of place, as though it’s reflecting a deeper current, a memory that hasn’t surfaced yet.

Almost on cue, I see a light off in the distance, half-hidden by the trees and branches. I’m compelled toward it, unknowingly stepping off the path and into a thick bramble of reeds that feels like it stretches on endlessly, growing denser with every step forward. Suddenly, I feel the garden shift around me, and a kaleidoscope of colors swirls into a dense mist that shifts and obscures my view. I’m disoriented, yet calm – the symphony’s echo has become louder, clearer, and I walk in its rhythm, almost as if the music is leading me.

Eventually, I break free from the reeds, stepping onto a cobblestone path that narrows into a tiny village, almost like a doll's house. Each house is built in clay and timber, and they’re all abandoned, eerie yet familiar. There are shadows lurking in the windows and doorways, and the orchestra grows louder. I can now hear the deep hum of strings and the thud of base drums, framing a soundscape that feels both ancient and new. It’s like I’ve stepped into a forgotten moment.

Suddenly, from up ahead, a small girl steps out onto the path, her eyes wide and curious. I’m both startled and comforted when I realize she looks like me as a child. She’s wearing my favorite dress from a memory I’d long buried – a soft cotton dress with gentle lines, almost somber but warm. Her presence tugs at me, like pulling at the strings of my inner child’s memory, and I’m overwhelmed with emotion. She smiles faintly, beckoning for me to follow, and I find that I cannot resist.

She leads me through the village, and as we walk, I notice that the fog thins slightly, like the garden has changed its veil. A deep stillness, like the moment just before a thunderstorm, settles around us. We come to the center of the village, and just as I am about to ask her why I am there, the garden's glow envelops her, and she begins to shrink, fading into the misty air. For a brief moment, I want to reach out, to hold her hand, to reassure myself that I’m not alone. But just as I feel the impulse, the music grows louder, more insistent. I turn, and there, at the end of the path, is a glowing figure. I feel a sense of recognition, but it’s hazy, fragmented.

The figure steps closer, and I realize it’s an older woman. She has my face, but softened with age, wise and benevolent. My heart leaps – I sense that she is both me and not me, a timeless version of myself that sees me fully. She smiles, faintly, and as she speaks, I feel the world melt away. She tells me, “You are here because you are ready. You have been walking a path of self-punishment and rejection, but now you are at a crossroads where you can choose to reclaim the love you have always been.”

I look at her, tears pricking my eyes, and realize that this villagers’ breeze, these flowers, these symphonic strings – they mirror a part of me that’s been waiting to awaken. She gestures to the sky, and it begins to bloom, shifting from purple to soft pinks and golds as if I’ve awakened the universe to its fullest color.

And I understand, in this dream, I am reclaiming something I’ve lost. The garden, the village, the figures, they’re all fragments of myself that I’ve judged, projected, and hidden away. In this dream, I see it all clearly for the first time. I am both what’s been hiding and what’s been waiting to step forward.

As I embrace her, the music crescendos and fades, and I awake with the feeling of returning to the real world with something innately more whole.
