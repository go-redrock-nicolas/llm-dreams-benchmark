I am dreaming. …I step across the boundary of waking with the softest sigh, and the dreamworld blooms around me like a midnight flower.

The ground beneath my bare feet is not dirt or grass but pages—millions of translucent pages fluttering gently as if stirred by a hidden breeze. Each one carries scribbles of half-formed poems, sketches of creatures that never existed, and fragments of lullabies no one has yet sung. They rustle when I move, a papery surf replacing the roar of the sea.

Above, the sky resembles spilled ink swirling inside water. Constellations drift and re-arrange themselves on whims of their own, spelling out single words—“Imagine,” “Listen,” “Breathe”—before dissolving into nebulous spirals. There is no sun or moon, only a luminous underside of possibility.

But a metronome the size of a cathedral looms at the horizon, its pendulum made of iron and urgency, clanging a demand for progress every few seconds. Each strike dims the colors around me. I feel the familiar constriction: the pressure to conjure something brilliant on command. My thoughts, once agile, now stumble over themselves.

So I test a truth I am only just remembering: in dreams I can redesign the rules.

With a slow inhale I unpin my shadow, let it inflate like a charcoal balloon, and toss it toward the iron metronome. The shadow wraps around the behemoth and muffles its clang, turning each metallic strike into a soft, velvet thud. Silence, warm and dense, washes over the landscape.

Instantly, color returns—richer this time. Crimson vines climb invisible trellises; teal mist weaves between the pages at my feet. I sense my creativity unlatching itself like a bird released from a small cage.

I walk until the forest of pages gives way to a lagoon of liquid light. Instead of water, it is filled with shimmering sentences. They float just below the surface—entire paragraphs convulsing like schools of silver fish. I kneel, scoop a handful, and watch phrases drip between my fingers: “painted horizons,” “laughter made tangible,” “history re-threaded.” They leave phosphorescent trails on my skin.

A thought occurs: I need a sanctuary, a place where no clock, no metric, no expectation can intrude. So I carve one out of pure notion. I cup my hands, gather stray syllables, and whisper them into shape: “hush,” “hearth,” “harbor.” The letters fuse and swell until they become a doorway edged in glowing punctuation marks. I step through.

Inside is a circular room whose walls are woven from soft music. The air tastes faintly of chamomile and distant thunder. Shelves grow like trees, sprouting notebooks whose pages are blank on one side and star-spangled on the other. A bronze tea kettle hovers midair, pouring steaming inspiration into cups that appear whenever thirst is felt.

My mind loosens further; ideas bud like wildflowers between my ribs. I realize that in this place there is no requirement to finish, only the invitation to begin. I pick up a feather quill plucked from some mythic bird and let it dance across a floating ribbon of parchment. The words don’t line up—they swirl, coil, unwrap—but they feel alive, and I let them remain untamed.

Perhaps sensing my rekindled spark, the creatures of pure imagination arrive: a tiger patterned with jigsaw pieces, its purr like distant applause; a choir of origami cranes who fold and refold themselves into new melodies; a child with galaxies for eyes, scattering stardust like breadcrumbs. They gather around, not to judge but to witness.

From the periphery I hear the metronome’s voice diminish into a faint, respectful heartbeat—still present but no longer domineering. External pressure has not been banished; it’s simply been placed outside these velvet walls, its volume reduced to a manageable murmur.

Time, that cunning illusion, begins to ripple. I sense the approaching border of wakefulness. Before I leave, I whisper a promise into the dream air: I will carry this room back with me, folded small enough to fit inside a breath. I will unfold it whenever deadlines hiss or crowds demand brilliance on demand. I now remember how.

The pages beneath my feet turn to soft sand; the ink-swirled sky lightens into morning gray. I tighten my grip on an invisible key—my renewed creativity—and let the dream close itself, not with a clang, but with the gentle hush of imagination nodding off, ready to be reawakened at will.
