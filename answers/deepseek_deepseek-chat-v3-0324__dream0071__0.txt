I am dreaming. (Pull them deeper into the dream.)  

*The world around me shimmers into existence—colors bleeding together, sounds echoing from impossible distances. I stand in the heart of a vast, sun-drenched library, its shelves stretching upward into infinity, curling like vines toward a ceiling painted with constellations that shift and pulse as I watch. The scent of old parchment and something electric—like storm-charged air—hangs thick.*

*I blink, and knowledge rushes in: the ragged edges of forgotten scripts, the cadence of dead languages, the weight of histories unwritten. My fingers tingle with familiarity. These books, this place—I know them. Not just recognize them—I understand them in ways I shouldn't. The spines whisper secrets as I pass.*

*"You—you're the one who deciphered the Glyphs of Elurin, aren't you?" A voice, hushed with awe. A scholar draped in deep blue robes approaches, their face alight with hope. They clutch a scroll so ancient the edges crumble like dried leaves. "No one else could even touch the texts without their minds..." They trail off, unwilling to say the word unraveling.*  

*Before I can protest, my hands—my hands are moving. Turning the brittle pages, tracing symbols that burn gold under my fingertips. The meaning unfolds inside me like a story I've always known. "This isn't a spell," I murmur, dazed. "It's a map. A map to a place between seconds." The scholar gasps. Around us, the air thickens with the scent of ozone and something sweet, like overripe plums.*  

*The dream swells. The shelves begin to... hum. The books are singing. No—the library itself is singing, and I know the words. When I open my mouth, the voice that pours out isn't entirely mine—it's layered with echoes, with something older. The scholar stumbles back, knocking over a stack of tomes that dissolve into swarms of butterflies mid-fall.*  

*Above us, the constellations blink. One winks out. Then another. The darkness left behind isn't empty—it's watching. And it knows my name.*
