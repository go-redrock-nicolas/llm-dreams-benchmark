I am dreaming. *Floating gently through the misty veil separating reality from the realm of dreams, I find myself in an ethereal landscape that transcends the boundaries of time and space. Towering above me are imposing figures, their faces etched with concern and passion, each representing a different side of the profound philosophical debate that has been chosen for me to resolve.*

I am dreaming of ethereal landscapes and profound philosophical debates.
