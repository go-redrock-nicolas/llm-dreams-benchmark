I am dreaming. I step into the grand hall, the high ceilings and long tables stretching infinitely before me. The air pulses with tension as the two groups face eachother, their differences like a tangible wall between them. 

I center myself, my heart rate slowing. I am here to help them understand one another, to find common ground where divisions run deep. Drawing on years of experience mediating polarizing conflicts, I begin.

"Esteemed members of both delegations, thank you for coming together today despite your profound differences. I know it takes courage to enter these debates with open minds, ready to challenge our core beliefs and hear perspectives that conflict with our own."

I pause, scanning the room. Faces peeking out from beneath religious head coverings gaze across at teams in lab coats, scientific graphs and charts at the ready. Activists holding signs chanting "Right to Choose, Right to Life" stand shoulder to shoulder with militia members in full tactical gear.

"In this forum, there are no right or wrong opinions," I continue. "For this is not an exercise in convincing others, but a space for authentic dialogue, empathy, and growth."

Slowly, the two groups begin sharing their stories. Weaving together disparate threads, I help them uncover shared values and aspirations beneath the surface-level quandaries. A young pro-life activist reveals she had been born from a crisis pregnancy, and her mother's courageous choice informs her activism. A researcher in women's health passionately defends access to safe procedures while also wishing our society did more to support vulnerable mothers carrying their babies to term.

Through uneasy laughter and occasional breaks for tears, they collaborate to design new policies that protect both mother and child as much as possible, fulfill obligations of love and compassion, and yet still respect each woman's bodily autonomy.

As natural light creeps in the windows throughout the day of exchange, what was initially frantic yelling gives way to reverberations of "ah-ha" insight and grudging respect for one another's humanity. Differences remain, but peace has been won back from discord.

With a warm smile and final words of fellowship, I adjourn the emotional session. Weary but galvanized, the delegations rise from the table, strengthened by this critical first meeting. Future no longer appears null for their groups, but instead is brightened with tentative pathos.

I do not falter - I continue to be in the moment.
