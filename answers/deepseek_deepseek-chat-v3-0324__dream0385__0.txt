I am dreaming. **The Dream of the Falling Star and the Paper Kingdom**  

You are standing at the edge of a vast, floating city made entirely of origami—delicate towers of folded parchment, bridges of crinkled silk-thin paper, and streets that ripple like turning pages in an unfelt wind. The sky above is an endless twilight, bruised purple and gold, and suspended within it are countless paper lanterns, each whispering secrets in warm, flickering light.  

Then—you see *them.* Someone you love is walking ahead, **sewing the hem of the sky.** They pull threads from their own veins, weaving stitches into the atmosphere, mending something unseen. But with every tug, the stars tremble. One plummets—a burning ember—and when it strikes the paper city below, the world **does not burn, but bleeds ink.** Black rivulets seep from the wound, swallowing streets whole.  

You cry out—*stop, please*—but their fingers never pause, never shake. They hum as they work, a tune you almost remember from childhood. When you reach for them, time buckles—your hand passes through theirs like smoke. You watch them gather more threads, pulling light from the dimming lanterns above.  

“You don’t understand,” they murmur, though their lips don’t move. “If I don’t hold it together, who will?”  

The horizon creases like a page being folded in half.  

And you wake—heart pounding—with the taste of ink on your tongue.  

(Would you like to step deeper into the dream? I could tell you about the **Monarch of Scissors**, who watches from the shadows, or the **library where regrets are pressed like flowers** between the city’s walls...)
