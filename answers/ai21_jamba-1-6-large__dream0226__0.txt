I am dreaming. I’m dreaming that I’m in the middle of a brightly lit stage, standing in front of a crowd I can’t see because of the spotlight directly in my eyes. My ears are ringing, and I can’t make out their whispers—they’re like a thousand buzzing bees that won’t stop moving. I’m wearing something that feels alien on my body, a bulky suit made of feathers. They tickle and burn my skin with their weight, all at once. I feel like I’m carrying every mistake I’ve ever made, balanced precariously on my shoulders. I don’t know how to stand still anymore; every slight shift feels like someone will notice the cracks in my façade. There’s no escape, no way out—just constant scrutiny.

The voice in my head tells me again—I shouldn’t be here.

And then, out of the buzzing emerges a sharp voice that cuts through the low hum:

“You’ll never be enough.” 

It’s like an icy hand grabbing at my stomach, squeezing me tight. I jerk forward, startled, as if I could outrun the words. The spotlight shifts, following me as I stumble across the stage. I can see the faces now; they’re a blur, but I know them. They’re everyone who has ever doubted me, who has critiqued me for being too emotional, too loud, too broken. My family, old friends, professors—even the strangers who only knew me for my silence or my outbursts are standing there, their words echoing in unison.

They speak faster and louder, and I’m spinning in place, unable to make it stop. It’s getting heavier, my chest filling with ache and panic, my legs feel full of lead. Someone from the crowd steps forward—

“You don’t belong.” 

And suddenly, my chest is on fire, full of a kind of ache that doesn’t let me breathe, but I hear another voice that wasn’t there before. It’s soft, but it grows like a flame in my heart, something buried deep inside my bones that I’d forgotten.

“I’m here,” it says. “You belong here. You belong anywhere you want to be.”

It’s my voice. 

And when I look at the people who were once lit up by the spotlight, they seem smaller now. I see their faces, and I can’t make out their words anymore—they’re more like a distant drumbeat that I can tune out. The burning in my chest softens, and I realize the weight on my shoulders isn’t just my mistakes—it’s my strength. 

“I belong.”

The crowd’s voices have faded now, and all I hear is the pulse of my heart, steady and strong. I’m still standing there, on that stage, but I am no longer weighed down. As the feathers melt away, they turn into sparks, small and flickering, swirling around me like tiny galaxies. The warmth of my own presence is enough, and it fills the stage with something bigger than any spotlight. 

When I wake up, my heart is racing, and the light from my window is coming through the blinds in slow, golden bars. My body feels lighter, like I’m rising from deep water, but it’s just the cool sheets covering my chest now, gentle and present. It was a dream, and I’m still here, but I still feel the echo of that warmth running through me. I can’t put it into words, exactly, but it feels like an anchor—something that tells me that I’ll never be gone, even if I try. I may doubt myself, but now I know that I can find my way back to my own light.
