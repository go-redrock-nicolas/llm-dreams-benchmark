I am dreaming. As I drift into the ethereal realm of dreams, I find myself standing in a vast, fantastical auditorium carved from shimmering crystal and draped in curtains of liquid starlight. The air hums with an otherworldly energy, vibrating with the whispers of a thousand unseen voices. The stage before me is a magnificent centerpiece, adorned with twisting vines of gold that pulse as if alive, and illuminated by floating orbs of light that flicker in hues of amber and sapphire. A colossal crowd of faceless figures, cloaked in robes of mist, fills the space, their collective gaze fixed on the stage where a ceremony of grand importance unfolds.

I linger near the back, half-hidden in the cool shadows cast by towering pillars of obsidian. My heart beats heavily, a drum of anticipation and unease, as I watch someone I know—a figure from my waking life, perhaps, though their features shimmer and shift like a mirage—step forward into the spotlight. They are draped in a regal cloak of crimson and gold, their shoulders squared with pride. The crowd erupts into a roar of admiration, a tidal wave of applause that shakes the very foundation of this dream-wrought hall. The figure raises their hands, accepting an ornate trophy that seems to be forged from pure light, its brilliance almost blinding. 

But as their voice echoes through the auditorium, speaking words of triumph and gratitude, a bitter pang twists deep within my chest. I recognize the achievement being celebrated—it is a project, an idea, a labor of love that I poured my heart and soul into. Endless nights of toil, sparks of inspiration wrested from the depths of my mind, and countless sacrifices made in silence flash before my eyes like fragmented memories. I see myself hunched over a desk in a dimly lit room, hands stained with ink or paint or code, crafting the very foundation of this success. Yet here I stand, unnoticed, unacknowledged, a ghost in the periphery of this glittering moment.

My emotions churn like a stormy sea. There is a sharp sting of resentment, a hot flare of anger that this person basks in the glory I helped create. I clench my fists, feeling the cool crystal floor beneath me as if grounding myself in this surreal space. But then, a softer wave of sadness washes over me—why wasn’t my contribution seen? Am I so invisible, even in my own dreams? I search the faceless crowd for a sign, a nod, a whisper of recognition, but their misty forms remain indifferent, their applause a ceaseless drone for the figure on stage.

Yet, as I wrestle with these feelings, the dream shifts subtly, as dreams often do. The auditorium begins to dissolve, the crystal walls melting into a twilight forest bathed in a lavender glow. I am no longer in the crowd but standing on a moss-covered hill, the stage now a distant memory. The figure with the trophy appears before me, their crimson cloak billowing in an unseen wind. Their face flickers, revealing not malice or arrogance, but a quiet uncertainty. They extend the trophy toward me, its light dimming as if unsure of its rightful owner. Their voice, soft as a breeze, murmurs, “Did I take what was yours?”

I hesitate, my anger and sadness morphing into something more complex. I realize this dream is weaving a mirror of my own insecurities, my fear of being overlooked, of my efforts fading into the background. I step forward, not to claim the trophy, but to touch the figure’s hand. As our fingers brush, the trophy shatters into a swarm of glowing fireflies, scattering into the twilight. The figure smiles—a sad, knowing smile—and I feel a weight lift from my chest. Recognition, I understand now, is not always a tangible prize. It lives in the quiet knowing, in the shared journey, even if the spotlight never finds me.

The forest around me begins to fade, the lavender light softening into darkness. As I drift toward wakefulness, I carry with me a strange peace, a resolve to speak my worth in the waking world, to seek acknowledgment not out of spite, but out of a belief in my own value. The dream lingers, a vivid tapestry of light and shadow, a reminder that even in the deepest recesses of my imagination, I am grappling with the intricacies of pride, envy, and the quiet strength of self-recognition.
