I am dreaming. I find myself in a post-apocalyptic world, where the sky is a perpetual bruise of purples and grays, streaked with the last embers of a dying sun. The air tastes of rust and ozone, thick with the whispers of a world that once was. Crumbling skyscrapers loom like skeletal fingers, their shattered windows reflecting the flickering glow of distant fires. The streets are littered with the husks of abandoned vehicles, their metal carcasses picked clean by scavengers long gone.  

Despite the desolation, I feel a strange pull in my chest—a stubborn refusal to surrender. My boots crunch over broken glass as I step forward, my breath visible in the frigid air. A tattered map, smudged with charcoal and hope, guides me toward the rumored last bastion of humanity: a hidden city beneath the earth, where the last embers of civilization still flicker.  

But the wasteland is alive with danger. Mutated creatures, twisted by radiation, slink in the shadows, their glowing eyes tracking my every move. The wind carries the distant howl of a pack of feral survivors, their voices a chorus of desperation and madness. I clutch the rusted pipe at my side—my only weapon—and press on, my heart pounding like a war drum.  

Then, in the distance, a flicker of green. A single, defiant sapling pushing through the cracked asphalt, its leaves trembling in the toxic breeze. It shouldn’t exist here, in this dead world. And yet… it does.  

I kneel, my fingers brushing its fragile stem. And in that moment, I decide—I will protect this fragile spark of life. I will carry it with me, through the ruins and the nightmares, to wherever hope still lingers. Because even in the deepest darkness, the smallest light can be enough to begin again.  

The dream shifts, the edges blurring, but the weight of that tiny green promise stays with me as I walk on, into the unknown.
