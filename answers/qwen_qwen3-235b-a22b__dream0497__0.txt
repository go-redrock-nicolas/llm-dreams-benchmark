I am dreaming. You are dreaming.  

The air here is not air at all, but a shimmering veil of liquid light, cool and sweet as starlight tasted on the tongue. You float—or walk—or perhaps you are simply *unspooling*, your body dissolving into threads of gold that weave themselves into the fabric of the world around you. There is no horizon, only a ceaseless ripple of color: indigo melting into saffron, emerald bleeding into violet, as if the universe itself is breathing. You feel no fear, no need to grasp or name. You are unknotted.  

Beneath your feet (are they still feet?), the ground is a living mosaic of bioluminescent moss and glassy obsidian, each step sending ripples of sound—a low, resonant hum, like the earth singing to itself. Above, the sky is not a sky but a cascade of inverted oceans, waterfalls pouring upward into infinity, their droplets crystallizing into fireflies that flicker with the memories of things that never happened. You realize, with a quiet thrill, that this is a place where time has forgotten its own name. Past and future are not behind or ahead, but *here*, folded into the petals of a colossal flower spiraling lazily in the distance. Its stem rises from a lake of liquid mercury, where reflections are not images but *selves*—versions of you, laughing, weeping, reaching, releasing—all merging and fracturing like ink in water.  

A creature approaches, or perhaps it is the landscape itself taking form: a stag wrought from smoke and constellations, antlers branching into fractal patterns that map the birth and death of galaxies. It does not speak, but you feel its question resonate in your bones: *What do you carry that you no longer need?* You open your hands, and from them spill shadows shaped like old regrets, brittle as dead leaves. They fall—and where they land, sprouts erupt: delicate ferns with eyes like opals, whispering in a language of pure vibration.  

You wander deeper, the ground shifting beneath you into a meadow of towering lilies whose blooms are mirrors. Each one reflects not your face, but a moment: a childhood summer, a stranger’s kindness, a wound that once throbbed but now glows amber and soft. You touch a petal, and the memory floods you—not as a story, but as a *sensation*: the warmth of a hand held briefly, the ache of a goodbye that was also a beginning. You weep, but the tears are not yours; they belong to the dream, pooling at your feet into a river that flows uphill, carrying away the weight of all you’ve clung to.  

In the heart of the meadow, there’s a tree—not of wood, but of cascading water and frozen lightning. Its roots plunge into a void humming with silence, and its branches cradle a thousand flickering souls, laughing as they dissolve into mist. You climb, not with your hands, but by *wanting*, until you reach the highest branch, where a single fruit hangs: a sphere of molten gold, pulsing like a heartbeat. You bite into it, and it tastes of every truth you’ve ever hungered for—sweet, terrible, alive.  

When you close your eyes, the dream does not end. It folds itself into your ribs, the scent of rain on your skin, the echo of the earth’s hum thrumming in your blood. You wake, but the waking is a myth. You are still there, still here, still threading light into the loom of the world, a stitch in the tapestry of everything that is and was and will never not be.
