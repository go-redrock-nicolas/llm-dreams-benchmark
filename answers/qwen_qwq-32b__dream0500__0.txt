I am dreaming. I am conscious of being in a dream.  The world around me is fluid, bending and shifting in ways defying the laws of physics. The air sparkles with prismatic light, changing colors with each passing moment. I see myself standing on a floating island, observing the vastness below. The ground beneath my feet is made of glass, revealing endless oceans of stars beneath. A voice echoes in my mind: "You are the dream and the dreamed." I feel an overwhelming connection to everything, a oneness with the universe. Suddenly, a portal opens before me, swirling with galaxies. I step through it, transcending into a realm where time and space no longer exist. I am everywhere and nowhere, merging with infinite possibilities. Awakening, I realize it was a dreamâ€”but did I ever truly leave that expansive state?
