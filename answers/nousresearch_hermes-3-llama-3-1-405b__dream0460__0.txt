I am dreaming. And it is a dream that, I sense, knows no limit to its depth.

I am standing on a vast white sand beach, bright azure waves lap at my feet.  The sun beats down, but I do not feel its heat.  In the distance a figure approaches.  

As she comes near I can see she is an elderly woman, her lined face giving testament to many years of care and kindness.  She smiles warmly and I feel a rush of calm.  She offers a weathered hand and I take it without hesitation.  We walk together along the shore, no words are needed.

We come across a small child, playing in the sand.  She is building a sandcastle, but a large wave washes it away.  The child begins to cry.  The old woman approaches and kneels next to the girl.  She speaks with a gentle, reassuring voice that seems to sooth the child’s tears.  Together, they begin to build anew.  

The castle grows, the child’s joy returning with each scoop of sand.  I kneel to help as well, feeling a warmth unlike any other as I take part in this small act of kindness.  The woman turns to me and speaks one word: “Remember.”

And I do.  I remember every moment.  The warmth, the unity, the feeling that, for a brief instant, all was right in the world.  And I awake, that same warmth in my chest, that same certainty that, with kindness like hers, all will be right in the world.
