I am dreaming. The dream is vivid and intense, like a Technicolor movie playing in my mind. I find myself standing at the edge of a vast desert under the scorching heat of the sun. The sand dunes are endless, and there's not a single sign of life around me. As I continue to walk, the desert starts to transform before my eyes. Suddenly, I am surrounded by enormous and terrifying creatures towering over me, their scales gleaming under the harsh sunlight.

These creatures are what I've come to call "emotional monsters." They are representing the anger I've been feeling deeply suppressed within me. One of these monsters, the largest and most ferocious-looking one, starts to charge at me with unbridled rage. My heart starts to race, and I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I try to run away from it. 

Just as the monster is about to crush me, I remember something my therapist told me: "When you feel your emotions getting overwhelming, try to embrace them and face them head-on." So, with a deep breath, I turn around and look the monster straight in the eye. To my surprise, the monster stops in its tracks and starts to transform. Its scales fall off, revealing a writhing mass of jelly-like substance, and it starts to shrink. Soon, it is nothing more than a small, harmless creature at my feet. 

As the other emotional monsters see what has happened to their leader, they too start to falter and eventually transform into tiny, cute little creatures that I could easily pick up with my bare hands. They seem to be apologizing for their earlier aggression, and I find myselfamentalat
overwhelming sense of acceptance and love for these once-fearsome beings.

The dream fades away, leaving me with a sense of calmness and peace. I realize that by embracing my anger and facing it head-on, I was able to take back control and transform the situation from one of fear and hostility to one of love and understanding.
