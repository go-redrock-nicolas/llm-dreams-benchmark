I am dreaming. 

You're drafted to replace a legendary performer minutes before a crucial show when they fall ill. With no preparation and an expectant audience, you step onto the stage with confidence, knowing that you can deliver. You begin to perform flawlessly, captivating the crowd with your energy and passion. As you continue to dance, sing, and entertain, the dream fades away...

You're in a large auditorium, filled with thousands of people. They're cheering for you, applauding loudly as you perform. Your heart beats fast, and your palms sweat. This is it. You can do this.
