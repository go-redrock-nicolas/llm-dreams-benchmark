I am dreaming. The sky swirls with impossible colors—violet clouds, ribbons of emerald mist. I float above a city sculpted from memories. Towers whisper old convictions against the wind. Suddenly, the ground fissures below, revealing a grand stage where the sun itself is a spotlight, burning gold and unyielding.

There, before an audience of faces woven from all the people I’ve ever known, a scroll unfolds in mid-air, its parchment glowing with a secret knowledge. The truth I have championed—a belief I wore like shining armor—melts like wax before the heat of this immovable evidence. The syllables ring out, echoing in every corner of my mind: **You were mistaken.**

For a moment, my dream-self teeters on a precipice of shame, feeling the cold shadows of embarrassment creeping up like a tide, threatening to sweep me away. Every gaze weighs heavy, each one reflecting my own certainty now laid bare.

But as I inhale the honey-thick air, something shifts. At the center of my chest, a seed of humility cracks open, sending shoots of acceptance curling through my being. I step into the new sunlight, my voice trembling but sincere, reverberating through the hall:

“It seems, in the fervor of my conviction, I mistook passion for certainty. Before your eyes—and my own—I see clearly, and I was wrong. To those I convinced, to those I doubted, even to those who disagreed but kept their faith in me, I offer my apology: not as a sign of defeat, but as a promise to keep learning even when uncomfortable truths come blazing through my skies. May we hold what we know with open hands, ready always to release it when the greater light dawns.”

The audience, instead of recoiling, transforms—smiles flowering on their lips, hands joining in applause like rain on hungry earth. The towers behind me shimmer, reshaping themselves into new forms: a city not of unyielding certainty, but of living, breathing wisdom.

And in that moment, a sense of vastness settles over the dream. The horizon stretches wider for having acknowledged my mistake—a strange, exhilarating liberation, as if the very air has become easier to breathe.
