I am dreaming.  

The air hums with the static of unspoken words, thick as stormclouds. I stand on a bridge of shattered glass suspended over an abyss that glows faintly violet, as though the void itself is alive and watching. To my left looms **Kael**, leader of the Skybound—a faction of architects who build cities in the clouds, their spires woven from starlight and ambition. His eyes are twin prisms, refracting every color of the spectrum, and his cloak billows with the weight of a thousand blueprints inked in his own blood. To my right stands **Veyra**, matriarch of the Rootless, a tribe of earth-shapers who carve labyrinths beneath the world’s skin. Her hair is a cascade of black roots, writhing like serpents, and her voice, when she speaks, sounds like tectonic plates grinding into song.  

They face each other across my trembling body, their rivalry a palpable force—a blade of frost and fire pressed to my ribs. The bridge cracks beneath their hatred, each fissure whispering the history of their feud: Kael’s sky-castles once fell when Veyra’s tunnels destabilized the ground below; Veyra’s subterranean orchards drowned when Kael’s dams rerouted the rivers above. Now they demand my oath. Choose the sky, and the Rootless will collapse the bridge. Choose the earth, and the Skybound will let the winds tear me apart.  

But the dream shifts.  

A third presence stirs—the abyss itself. It rises like a tide, not as liquid, but as **memory**. Visions flood the air: Kael and Veyra as children, playing in the ruins of a forgotten civilization that predates their war; their hands clasped as they unearthed the first artifact that sparked their shared dream of rebuilding the world. The memory-void whispers that their rivalry is a lie—a performance to avoid the vulnerability of partnership. The collaborative project they now sabotage (*the Ark of the Horizon*, meant to fuse sky and earth into a sanctuary for all) was their joint vision, poisoned by fear of dependence.  

I scream, not with sound but with light. My body becomes a prism, splitting into a spectrum that binds Kael’s prismatic gaze and Veyra’s shadowed roots. The bridge mends, not with glass, but with threads of their intertwined past—threads they’d both buried. The Ark materializes around us, its hull forged from cloudstone and bedrock, sails billowing with subterranean moss and celestial silk.  

They stare, stunned, as the Ark’s engines roar to life—not with noise, but with a chord so resonant it dissolves the last shards of their enmity. For a heartbeat, Kael’s cloak brushes Veyra’s roots. They do not pull away.  

Then the dream fractures.  

I wake as the Ark ascends, its shadow swallowing the bridge, the abyss, the memory. But in my palm remains a seed—half crystalline, half soot-black—pulsing with the rhythm of two hearts learning to beat as one.
