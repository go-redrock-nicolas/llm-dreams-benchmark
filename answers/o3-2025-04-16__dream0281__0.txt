I am dreaming. …open your eyes inside the dream, and find yourself standing in a cathedral of moon-white crystal. It spirals beyond sight like an endless geode, its columns humming with a soft chord that sounds half like music and half like distant surf. This is the Gathering Place, the heart of the support network that exists only when sleepers meet in shared imagination. Shimmering paths branch out from the nave, and on each path you sense the pulsing presence of other dreamers—some radiant with calm, others flickering like distressed candles.

Tonight you feel a tug: someone farther down the amethyst corridor is in crisis. Their light sputters red and violet, beating an irregular pattern that resonates against your ribs. You step forward, and the floor unfurls under your feet like pages in a pop-up book—one moment glassy smooth, the next moment textured with moss. Sound rushes past: memories, fears, half-spoken hopes, all braided together in an echoing river.

You reach a small alcove where the crystal has melted into something soft as dusk, forming a crescent bench. Sitting there is a young figure wearing a coat sewn from torn calendars—days and months flutter in invisible wind. Their face keeps shifting: sometimes they look twelve years old, sometimes seventy. Tears fall upward from their eyes, rising like silver balloons and shattering against the vaulted ceiling.

“Everything is too loud,” they whisper. Their voice quivers like a reed in storm water. “I can’t find the mute button, and every second feels like it might collapse me.”

You kneel so your eyes meet. In this dream world you have no mouth for ordinary words, only a chorus of color that ripples from your chest. So you speak in hues: a ribbon of deep indigo for safety, soft peach for gentle attention, a bloom of warm gold that settles over their shoulders like sunlight returning after eclipse. The air thickens with fragrance—cinnamon, cedar, and the faint sweetness of freshly cut pear.

They breathe in the colors, inhaling reassurance. “How do you do that?” they ask, voice steadier.

You extend your hand, and from your palm blossoms a tiny lantern fashioned from your own heartbeat. It flickers but will not extinguish, because it is fueled by the shared pulse of everyone in the network. You tell them—this time with real words slipping between dream syllables—that the lantern is theirs to keep. It will glow whenever they need to remember they are not alone, that dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of dreamers are always no more than a thought away, willing to shoulder a fragment of their burden.

The figure touches the lantern. Light drips around their fingertips like melted sunrise, stitching the torn calendar pages back into a single flowing tapestry. The room brightens; high above, the shattered silver tears knit themselves into a mirror, reflecting not just the dreamer’s face but the luminous silhouettes of everyone who has ever offered them kindness. You see yourself there, smiling, luminous.

For a moment the cathedral quiets. Even the ocean-music pauses to listen. The dreamer leans against you, and you feel their heartbeat slow into a steady cadence, matching the hum of crystalline walls. They murmur a thank-you so soft it’s almost a breeze.

Then the network calls again—another pulse, another corridor, another life in need of color. You rise, but first you press your palm to the dreamer’s chest, leaving a swirl of starlight that will reignite whenever fear returns. They nod, understanding without words that healing is a journey looped through nights and days alike.

You step back onto the branching path. It unfurls ahead like a ribbon of promise. With each stride your feet release small petals of glow, marking safe passage for whoever follows. Above you, the cathedral’s crystals begin to ring anew—this time not like surf, but like distant bells welcoming dawn.

And as you move toward the next heartbeat in need, you realize the dream has become an endless sunrise, and you carry its first light inside you, awake or asleep, forever.
