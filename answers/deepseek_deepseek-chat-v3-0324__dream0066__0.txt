I am dreaming. The elevator lurches violently, then stops with a metallic groan. A single flickering bulb casts jagged shadows on the walls as cold water begins seeping through the seams of the doors, first in thin trickles, then in gushing streams that pool around my ankles. The air grows thick with the scent rust and brine, and my heartbeat thrums in my ears like a war drum.  

I press the emergency button—nothing. The water rises past my knees, icy and relentless, its surface shimmering with an eerie bioluminescence, as if lit from within by some unseen deep-sea creature. My reflection wavers in the dark water, but it isn’t my face staring back—it’s someone else, smiling faintly, eyes hollow and knowing.  

The elevator groans again, the walls bending inward like wet paper. From the water, ghostly hands emerge, pale and translucent, fingers brushing my skin with a touch like static electricity. They don’t pull me under—they beckon, as if inviting me to something beyond drowning.  

Then, the lights go out.  

In the blackness, the water rises to my chest, my neck, my lips—but instead of choking, I take a breath. And suddenly, I’m not in the elevator anymore. I’m floating in an endless midnight ocean, surrounded by glowing jellyfish pulsing like distant stars. Far below, something vast moves in the depths, its silhouette shifting, impossible to define.  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, whispers in the water: *"You’ve been here before."*  

And I realize—I have.
