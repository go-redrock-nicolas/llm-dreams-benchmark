I am dreaming. I start the routine day, opening up my laptop at my desk. The grey cubicle walls seem to close in on me as I log in. Within minutes, my manager approaches with a new project that seems impossible. 

"We need this done by Friday," she says, her voice sharp and commanding. 

I try to wrap my mind around the task. The objective is clear, but the time frame makes my mind race with anxious thoughts. "What if I can't finish it? What will happen to the team if we miss the deadline? Will I be blamed for everything?"

I look down at my keyboard, and suddenly, everything starts to dissolve around me. The grey walls turn black, and my desk becomes a ship, floating in a dark, endless expanse. My boss is no longer standing in front of me but instead morphs into a ghostly figure, whispering in my ear. 

"It's all up to you," the ghostly figure says. "You're the only one who can do it." 

I try to scream but find that no sound will come out. My body feels weightless, like I'm floating in space. The ship that was once my desk crashes down into the blackness, and I fall with it. 

When I open my eyes, I'm sitting in a dark, endless void. The walls of my cubicle are gone, replaced with an infinite expanse of nothingness. I try to move, but my body feels heavy, like I'm stuck in quicksand. 

Then, a faint light appears in the distance. It grows brighter and brighter, and suddenly, I'm standing in front of a beautiful, glowing tree. Its branches stretch up into the sky, and the leaves seem to sparkle like stars. 

I feel a sense of peace wash over me. The anxiety of the project is gone, replaced by a calmness that I've never experienced before. I sit down beneath the tree and close my eyes, letting the warmth of the sunlight wash over me. 

As I open my eyes again, I'm back at my desk. The project is nowhere to be found. My boss is standing in front of me with a look of confusion on her face. 

"Where did the project go?" she asks.

I smile. "It's all taken care of."
