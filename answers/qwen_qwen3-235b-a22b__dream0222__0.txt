I am dreaming. ******

I am seated at the head of a long, obsidian table that seems to float in the air, suspended over a churning sea of shadow and starlight. The walls of the chamber are not walls at all, but veils of liquid light, shifting between colors that have no names in any earthly tongue. The air is thick with the scent of forgotten memories — damp parchment, a mother’s perfume, the ash of a first fire.

Around the table, the participants shimmer, their forms flickering between the faces they wish me to see and the shadows they truly are. They speak in honeyed tones, their words gilded with diplomacy, but behind their eyes lurk embers of secret hungers — power, revenge, salvation. Each one wears their position like a costume stitched from lies.

The Zareth Envoy, cloaked in robes that ripple with unspoken promises, claims to seek peace, yet her fingers drum a code only the spies in the rafters can understand. The High Chancellor of the Glass Accord folds his hands like a prayer, but his left pinky twitches — a tell I’ve noted from past dreams — whenever he feeds the room a falsehood dressed in truth's skin.

And then there is the Hollow Prince of the Dunes, face a carved mask of bone and jade. He never speaks. He plays with a small, ever-burning brazier placed before him, dropping snippets of parchment into the flames — each scrap a whisper, a confession, a ghost of someone’s fear.

I can feel the tension now, like a taut string vibrating between two opposing forces. My role here is unclear, yet pressing — perhaps arbiter, perhaps saboteur, perhaps only witness. But I know that in this dream-world, only the deepest truths are spoken through silence. I do not speak, not yet.

I watch as layers begin to peel away — conversations loop back on themselves, contradictions exposed like veins beneath skin, until the veils, one by one, begin to tear. When the Envoy denies an earlier statement, the air shimmers and the very moment replays behind her eyes — a lurching echo, visible to all.

Gasps ripple through the chamber like wind through dry leaves.

The Hollow Prince finishes burning his final piece of paper, and when he lifts his masked face to meet mine, I see a single tear of molten silver slip from the corner of his mask.

It falls to the table and hisses. The obsidian cracks. A pulse of energy ripples outward, and suddenly the chamber is dissolving.

We are standing on the brink of a deep cosmological rift, where time folds like paper and intentions become reality. The masks begin to come off — not metaphorically, but literally. Faces reveal themselves: eyes with ancient starlight pulsing inside them, mouths stitched shut with threads of forgotten oaths.

And I, who have watched but not acted, now feel the chasm reaching for me. It sings with the voice of all truths left unsaid — a lullaby, a requiem, an invitation. I feel myself leaning forward, not in fear, but in recognition. This dream is not about negotiation, but revelation.

The table disappears beneath me. I fall, not down, but *into.* Into forgotten truths, into the marrow of my own forgotten stories. Faces from past lives flash around me — some familiar, some never met. And behind all of them, something ancient reaches out, with hands like roots beneath a castle, whispering:

*"Welcome back."*
