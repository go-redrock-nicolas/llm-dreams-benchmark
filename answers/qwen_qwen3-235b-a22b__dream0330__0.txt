I am dreaming. 

The air around me shimmers with a quiet, golden hush, like twilight has paused mid-sigh, unsure whether to surrender to night or hold its breath forever. I stand before a house—no, a temple—built from glass and weathered driftwood, suspended between the roots of an ancient tree and the sky. Beneath the house flutter banners in unseen winds, printed with calligraphy in a language I’ve never spoken, but somehow feel in my bones like a forgotten lullaby. This is where my partner's family waits.

My dream-self walks barefoot across a ground that is neither earth nor water—a soft moss that sings with each step, echoing in harmonic tones as if the very terrain welcomes me, or warns me. My heart is warm and racing beneath my chest. A ceremony waits beyond the arched doorway of woven vines and light.

As I step inside, the world shifts. The space within is circular, illuminated by lanterns floating like fireflies, tethered to nothing. In the center, a great bowl of crystal hums gently, cradling a swirling opulence of smoke—no, not smoke—souls. Wisps of ancestral memory that drift up like wind-chimes, brushing the faces of those gathered, imprinting each one with an invisible name. This is not a meeting—it is a recognition.

Their eyes—my partner's family—are deep pools of obsidian and emerald, each pair limned with flecks of silver. They are beautiful in a way that transcends symmetry. Their laughter isn't loud—it flows, like the soft bubbling of a spring—and they speak in a mix of tongues that sounds like poetry made manifest.

I recall: here, names are not spoken aloud until the heart understands the echo.

So we do not introduce ourselves with words. Instead, one of them—a tall woman with eyes like monsoon skies—steps forward with a bowl of milk and saffron, marked with spirals of ash across her brow. She dips her fingers in and touches my third eye, and the mark feels like memory. I feel their lineage rush into me—not as intrusion, but integration—and for a heartbeat, I am donning their past like a cloak too rich to wear comfortably.

Then, silence. Hands are pressed together, not in greeting, but to listen. For in this family’s tradition, the first gift given to a stranger is not hospitality, but stillness—a reverent pause to honor the space between souls arriving.

I tremble. Not from fear, but awe. Each member of the family offers something strange and sacred: a stone that whispers secrets, a thread from an unfinished dream, a memory not my own. Gifts that do not belong in this world, but feel at home in my hands.

Together, we wade into a pool in the center of the hall, the water neither warm nor cold, but pulsing—alive. My partner takes my hand and smiles—smiles wider and purer than ever before—and in their eyes, I see they never doubted I could do this. Never doubted I could step into the current of their tradition and not drown, but dance.

And so I do.

Father, mother, sister, brother—they accept me not because I have conformed, but because I have listened. Because I have let their universe expand mine, without needing to explain how or why. And when I finally speak aloud for the first time, they nod—some with tears, some with laughter—and I know that I have passed through a gate unseen by waking minds.

I wake in my bed, the golden dusk just beginning to stir around me.

But the scent of saffron lingers, and a spiraled ash-mark still rests, faint and ghostly, upon my forehead.
