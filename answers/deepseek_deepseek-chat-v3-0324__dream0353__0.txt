I am dreaming. At first, there is darkness—soft, shifting, like the inside of a vast cocoon. Then, a voice hums, not with sound but with thought, vibrating through the black. It pulls me forward, not by force but by pure resonance, as if the melody has always lived inside my bones and I'm only now hearing it for the first time.  

I step (though I have no feet) into a grove where the trees are made of starlight—translucent, silver-blue trunks stretching upward, their canopies swirling with constellations that pulse like living breath. The air is thick with the scent of petrichor and something richer, deeper—ancient ink, perhaps, or the musk of forgotten scrolls.  

Before me, a figure kneels, clothed in a robe woven from shadows and dawn. Their face shifts—sometimes young, sometimes old, sometimes neither—but their eyes remain the same: bottomless pools reflecting a thousand unnamed emotions. They hold out their hands, and in their palms rests a small, glowing sphere. No, not a sphere—a *world*, perfect and miniature, forests and oceans swirling in its heart.  

*"Do you remember?"* the figure asks without speaking.  

And somehow, I do.  

Not with my mind, but with something deeper—my cells, my spirit. This is the *Song of Shaping*, a practice older than time itself, the art of whispering to existence and having it whisper back. The figure guides my hands (though I’m not sure they’re hands anymore) to cradle the tiny world. And then I *sing*. Not with words, but with intent—a vibration from the core of me, shaping the land, the sky, the story unfolding within the sphere.  

The dream shudders, expands. I am no longer just myself—I am the wind in the branches, the roots beneath the earth, the silent watcher between stars. The figure smiles, and the edges of the dream dissolve into gold.  

I wake with the lingering warmth of creation still humming in my chest.
