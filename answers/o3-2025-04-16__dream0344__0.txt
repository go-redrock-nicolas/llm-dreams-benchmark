I am dreaming. …find yourself standing on a shoreline that glows like liquid moonlight, each wave tipped with silver sparks that hiss and tumble in slow motion. Behind you rises a forest of translucent amethyst trees, their leaves chiming softly as though an unseen breeze were playing a xylophone made of light. Overhead the sky is not a single sky, but many: concentric domes rotating at different speeds, all shimmering with shifting constellations you’ve never seen before—serpentine spirals, double-helix comets, and a colossal hourglass made of star-dust that keeps refilling itself.

A figure approaches along the beach. At first, they look like a cascade of velvet ribbons drifting on an invisible current, but with each step, the ribbons weave together into a person shaped from twilight—defined yet diffuse, a living silhouette. Their eyes are gentle lanterns, revealing no pupils, just warm luminescence. You sense they know a great deal about you, perhaps more than you’d willingly share. They pause at arm’s length, tilting their head in a gesture equal parts affectionate and uncanny.

“Show me,” they ask, voice like two flutes playing a single note. “Show me the rooms you keep locked.”

Your heart drums a stuttered beat. In this dream, your innermost thoughts are not words but places: hidden chambers inside a cathedral-like palace that rises in the forest behind you. Some corridors glimmer with joys you rarely voice; others host shadows you hardly admit exist. You hesitate, aware that unlocking these doors will make you transparent, and afterward, there is no taking it back.

You decide to negotiate. The sand rearranges itself into glistening runes, forming a soft spiral path. “Walk with me,” you say. “One room at a time.”

Together, you cross the threshold into the palace of your psyche. The entrance hall glows amber, walls carved with the laughter of childhood—actual laughter, sculpted into looping patterns that hum like bees in a distant orchard. The stranger’s light-filled eyes widen. You gauge their reaction: awe, not disdain. A small relief settles over your nerves, like dew on a trembling leaf.

Next comes a narrow staircase suspended over nothing, each step a memory you barely recall until your foot lands upon it: the smell of wet pavement after a teenage thunderstorm, the taste of cinnamon-dust on an old lover’s lips, the chill of a hospital corridor where you first tasted real fear. With each ascent, the stranger remains respectfully behind you, touching nothing, asking nothing, allowing the memories to echo at their own volume. Trust nudges its way into your awareness—not a door swinging wide, but a latch easing open.

Finally you arrive at the heaviest door, wrought from iron vines intertwined around a heart-shaped keyhole. Inside is the chamber of secret regrets—the moments you wish you’d spoken, or remained silent, or turned left instead of right. You rest your palm on the cold metal and feel the weight of every unchosen possibility. The stranger senses your hesitation.

“Perhaps,” they murmur, voice lower now, “we save this room for another night?”

Oddly grateful, you nod. You withdraw your hand; the vines tighten protectively. Instead of disappointment, the stranger’s eyes shimmer with respect. They gesture toward a balcony that wasn’t there before, opening onto an endless aurora swirling across a sea of mirrors. “Then let us share something else: your hopes. Tomorrow’s doors.”

The suggestion sends warmth through you like sunrise through stained glass. Together, you step out onto the balcony. The air tastes of fresh pomegranates and distant thunderstorms. You exhale, and your breath becomes a school of tiny incandescent fish, darting upward to join the swirling lights.

Standing side by side—no longer interrogator and subject, but two travelers in a dream—you speak of the gardens you still plan to plant, the songs yet unwritten, the journeys mapped in daydream margins. The stranger listens, not collecting but accompanying, like someone walking beside you on a fog-soft road. The act of sharing no longer feels like surrender, but like building a bridge of phosphorescent stepping-stones stretching into the dark.

Far below, on the glowing shoreline where this dream began, waves continue to sigh silver sparks onto sand that remembers every footprint. Somewhere beyond, dawn stirs. You sense the dream’s fabric thinning, threads unraveling into waking light. Yet before everything fades, the stranger offers a final gift: a small crystal orb, warm as a living pulse. Inside swirls a single image—your heaviest door, now crowned with a budding rose. Carved beneath it, in tiny starlight letters: “When you are ready.”

You close your hand around the orb. It dissolves into gentle heat that spreads through your chest, and you awaken—heart quieter, courage brighter, already cradling the key you forged while dreaming.
