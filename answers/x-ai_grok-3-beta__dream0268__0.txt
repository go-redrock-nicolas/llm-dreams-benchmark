I am dreaming. As I drift into the realm of dreams, the world around me shimmers with an ethereal glow, a twilight haze blurring the edges of reality. I find myself standing in an ancient, sprawling library carved from obsidian and moonstone, its towering shelves laden with tomes that whisper secrets in languages long forgotten. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and a faint, intoxicating trace of lavender carried on an unseen breeze. Each step I take echoes softly, the sound spiraling upward into the cavernous ceiling where constellations of glowing orbs float like captive stars, casting a pale, silvery light.

I’m not alone, though at first, I feel the weight of solitude pressing against me. There are others here—faceless figures draped in flowing robes of mist and shadow, their voices murmuring just beyond comprehension. They speak of an event, something momentous from my past, a turning point that shaped the very fabric of who I am. Yet, as I strain to grasp the details, my mind betrays me. The memory is a fractured mosaic, pieces scattered like leaves in a storm. I know it happened—I *feel* the weight of it in my chest, a bittersweet ache—but the specifics slip through my fingers like water.

Desperate, I turn to the nearest shelf, my trembling hands reaching for a book bound in leather that pulses faintly, as if alive. The cover is embossed with symbols that writhe and shift under my gaze, refusing to settle into any recognizable form. When I open it, the pages are blank at first, but then ink begins to bleed onto the parchment, forming words in a script I somehow understand despite never having seen it before. “The Festival of the Crimson Bloom,” it reads, and suddenly, a rush of fragmented images floods my mind: a sky painted with streaks of scarlet and gold, laughter echoing through a crowded square, the heat of a thousand candles flickering in the night, and a piercing, heartbreaking farewell that left a scar on my soul.

But the others around me, those spectral figures, disagree. Their murmurs grow insistent, their voices weaving a different tale. They speak of a storm, a tempest that tore through a coastal village, of houses crumbling into the sea and a desperate flight under a merciless, rain-lashed sky. I shake my head, confusion knotting my thoughts. That can’t be right—I remember the festival, don’t I? The taste of honeyed wine on my lips, the rhythm of drums pulsing through the ground, a hand slipping from mine as tears blurred my vision. Or was it the icy grip of seawater, the roar of thunder drowning out my cries for help?

I stumble deeper into the library, searching through my fragmented memories as though they are hidden among these endless shelves. Each book I touch offers a different vision, a kaleidoscope of half-truths and contradictions. In one, I’m dancing barefoot on cobblestones slick with dew, surrounded by faces I know but cannot name, their smiles both warm and mournful. In another, I’m clinging to the jagged edge of a cliff, saltwater stinging my wounds as I scream into the void for someone lost to the waves. The dissonance tears at me, a discordant symphony of what was and what might have been.

The library begins to shift, the walls melting into a forest of glass trees, their branches tinkling like wind chimes as they sway under an unseen force. My reflection stares back at me from their crystalline surfaces, but it’s not just one reflection—there are dozens, hundreds, each wearing a different expression, each holding a different piece of the puzzle. One version of me weeps silently, crimson petals falling from her hands. Another stands stoic against a raging storm, her hair plastered to her face by rain and grief. “Which is true?” I whisper, my voice trembling as it echoes through the fragile grove. But the reflections only shimmer, offering no answers.

Time seems to bend here, stretching and folding in on itself. I feel as though I’ve been searching for eons, my heart a heavy anchor dragging behind me. The spectral figures follow, their whispers growing louder, more discordant, until they form a cacophony that threatens to shatter the glass forest around us. “Remember!” they urge, but their versions clash like swords in battle. I clutch my head, sinking to my knees as the ground beneath me ripples like a still pond disturbed by a stone.

Then, from the chaos, a single clear memory surfaces—a hand reaching for mine, warm and calloused, grounding me amidst the storm or festival or whatever it truly was. The sensation is so vivid, so achingly real, that I gasp, my eyes snapping open within the dream. The glass trees are gone, replaced by a vast, endless mirror that reflects not my face, but a swirling vortex of reds and grays, celebration and calamity intertwined. At its center, that hand remains, outstretched, waiting.

I reach for it, my fingers brushing against the mirror’s surface, and in that moment, I realize it doesn’t matter which memory is true. What matters is the feeling—the love, the loss, the raw, unfiltered humanity of it all. As my hand passes through the mirror, a wave of warmth engulfs me, and the discordant voices fall silent. The dream begins to dissolve, the edges softening like a watercolor painting left in the rain, but the weight in my chest lightens, replaced by a quiet, bittersweet peace.

I am dreaming, and though the details remain elusive, I carry the essence of that past event with me, a lantern glowing softly in the labyrinth of my mind as I drift toward waking.
