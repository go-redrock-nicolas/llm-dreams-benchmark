I am dreaming. I stand in the center of a bustling town square. I am surrounded by the vibrant energy of life, people laughing, vendors calling out their wares, children chasing pigeons that scatter into the sky. Sunlight warms my skin, and the air hums with the symphony of everyday existence. A sense of peace washes over me until I look up.

The sky. It's not the familiar blue expanse I know. Instead, it's a swirling canvas of impossible colors, hues of deep violet and angry orange merging like oil on water. In the center of this celestial chaos, a celestial body hangs ominously. It pulses with a faint, sickly green light. I know, with the chilling certainty that only dreams can provide, that this is not a natural phenomenon. This is a harbinger.

A voice, ancient and disembodied, whispers in my mind, echoing through the chambers of my subconscious. It speaks of convergence, of energies aligning, and of an impending celestial collision. The celestial body I see is not a star or a planet, but a tear in the fabric of reality, growing unstable. In exactly one hour, it will rupture, unleashing a wave of raw, untamed cosmic energy that will unravel this world, erasing everything I see.

Panic claws at my throat, cold and sharp. I have to warn them. I have to make them understand. I run towards the nearest group of people, merchants haggling over glistening silks. "Listen to me!" I shout, my voice trembling slightly. "Look at the sky! We are in terrible danger!"

They turn, their faces initially curious, then shifting to amusement, and finally, dismissal. One merchant, a stout man with a booming laugh, claps me on the shoulder. "A vivid imagination, friend! But the sky has always been a bit peculiar here. Adds charm, wouldn't you say?" He gestures dismissively towards the swirling heavens. "Now, about these silks..."

Frustration boils within me. I try again, racing towards a group of philosophers debating near a marble fountain. "Please, you must understand! That... thing... in the sky! It's not natural! It's a warning! We only have an hour!"

One philosopher, stroking his long grey beard, gazes upwards thoughtfully. "Ah, the Celestial Swirl," he says, his voice calm and measured. "A fascinating object of endless debate. Some say it's a portal, others a reflection of our collective unconscious. Danger? My dear fellow, it's been there for centuries. It's part of the very soul of our city." He smiles condescendingly. "Perhaps you've had a bit too much sun?"

No one believes me. My warnings bounce off them like pebbles against a fortress wall. They are shielded by their normalcy, their ingrained acceptance of the bizarre sky as just another feature of their world. Their reality is too rigid to accept the truth I carry.

Desperation begins to gnaw at the edges of my composure. I can feel the minutes slipping away like grains of sand through my fingers. The pulsing green light from the celestial tear seems to intensify, casting an eerie luminescence over the square. The vibrant colors in the sky writhe more intensely now, the violets deepening to near black, the oranges burning like cosmic embers.

I stand alone, the vibrant energy of the square now feeling like a mockery. The laughter sounds hollow, the haggling pointless, the philosophical debates absurdly trivial. They are all living on borrowed time, oblivious to the cosmic sword hanging by a thread above their heads.

Yet, as the final minutes tick down, a strange calm descends upon me. Perhaps it's the acceptance of the inevitable, the realization that I've done all I can. My panic subsides, replaced by a profound sense of detachment. I find a stone bench near the edge of the square, away from the oblivious crowds, and sit.

I watch the clock tower in the distance, its hands moving with agonizing slowness, each tick echoing the frantic beat of my own heart just moments before. Now, my heart rate slows, matching the measured rhythm of the clock. I observe the scene before me â€“ the children still chasing pigeons, the merchants folding their silks, the philosophers gesturing emphatically. It's all so fragile, so temporary.

The green light in the sky pulses faster, brighter. The air grows heavy, charged with an unseen energy that makes the hair on my arms stand on end. A low hum begins to resonate, vibrating through the stone bench, through my bones.

I close my eyes, not in fear, but in quiet resignation. I picture the faces of those I tried to warn, their disbelief, their amusement. There's no anger left, only a deep, aching sorrow for the beautiful, vibrant world about to be undone. The hum grows louder, becoming a roar that drowns out all other sounds. The light behind my eyelids intensifies, shifting from green to blinding white.

This is it. The hour is up. I take one final, deep breath, holding onto the fading sensation of the sun on my skin, the memory of laughter, the impossible beauty of the swirling sky. I wait for the unraveling, adrift in the final moments of a world that refused to see its own end. And in that waiting, there is a strange, heartbreaking peace.

And then... I wake up.
