I am dreaming. You are standing at the edge of an infinite gorge. The vast, endless chasm stretches out before you, its depth obscured by drifting mists that swirl in the canyon below. The air is crisp, carrying with it a subtle whiff of petrichor that tells you of ancient rains, though none have fallen for millennia. The walls of the gorge are sheer and smooth, webbed with faint strata of forgotten silt, as if the very earth had tried to hold on to something it lost long ago.

The gorge isn't entirely silent. A strange, almost imperceptible keening resonates from the walls, like the mournful cry of some ancient creature far below. It seems to vibrate deep within your being, an almost physical ache that makes you pause.

But this isn't the core of the dream. That waits at the edge of the empty void where the gorge vanishes into a boundless, liminal space. There is no clear boundary between the canyon and this place of transition. It's as though the world simply... ends.

As you move closer, the feeling of incomprehension fills you. You try to speak, to articulate that feeling of something just out of reach—a complexity too deep to fit within normal emotions. The words don't come, or perhaps they come too fast, too jumbled, too fragmented. Sentences break apart, becoming incoherent fragments that slip through your grasp before you can grasp them.

The more you try to name this feeling, the more the gorge seems to shift, its walls pulling away in impossible ways. What began as a sharp, clearly defined chasm now blurs into an amorphous blur, as if the entire landscape were becoming a reflection of your unspoken confusion. You are both observer and observed in this surreal place, simultaneously trying to speak and grapple with something that resists articulation.

But you can't look away. There's something compelling about this blur, something almost alive, like it’s reaching out to grasp at your mind with a tendril of understanding. And you understand it understands, even if you can't fully comprehend what "it" is. It's a dizzying, otherworldly communion where you sense meaning unfurling just beyond the limits of your perception.

You feel it—a sudden, overwhelming emotional recognition that slips just beyond your reach, always out of focus. You are more acutely aware of the spaces between things, of the intangible energy linking one moment to the next, of the void as not an absence but a presence.

And then, just as you are about to deliver the final, incoherent fragment of your desperate attempt to name this incalculable feeling, the dream shifts. The gorge fades, the keening softens, and you are left with only a lingering sense of something seen but unremembered, felt but forgotten. The dream fades, and you wake, not with a start, but with a slow, uncurling realization that something was there, just beyond the corner of your imagination, waiting to be spoken but never quite grasped.
