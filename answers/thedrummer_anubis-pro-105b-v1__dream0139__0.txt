I am dreaming. I awake with a start, my mind swirling in a tornado of confusion. The world around me appears familiar yet completely alien, like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. My name is Alina, and I live in a reality where the very fabric of sanity has been turned inside out.

As I step out of my small, damp apartment, I am bombarded by a cacophony of illogical yet normative.
A group of women are frantically growing their eyebrows into robust a nest of ancient trees.
A young man passing by is feline, his eyes glowing a deep crimson.
I watch in a stroke of dazed wonderment as their perfect recreation of Las Vegas's Bellagio fountains.
