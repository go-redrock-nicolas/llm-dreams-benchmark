I am dreaming. I'm creating a vivid dream using the deepest parts of my imagination.   

As the day approaches and small details start going wrong, you feel a growing sense of dread. You know that if this event fails, it will have serious consequences for many people. You've been working on this for months, with a team of experts who have their own areas of responsibility. But now it seems like everything is falling apart.

The weather forecast says there will be a storm tomorrow, but you hope it won't arrive until after the event is over. You check the website where people can register for the event, and see that some of the links aren't working properly. You contact the person in charge of IT, but they don't respond right away.

You go to the location where the event will take place, and find that some of the equipment isn't set up correctly. You contact the person in charge of logistics, but they don't respond right away.

You meet with some of the guests who have agreed to participate in the event, and find that some of them aren't as knowledgeable as you thought they were. You contact the person in charge of marketing, but they don't respond right away.

You feel a surge of anxiety, and wonder if you've made any mistakes. You check your notes, and see that there are some gaps where you didn't fill in all the information. You contact the person in charge of content, but they don't respond right away.

You decide to take some action, even though it might make things worse. You send an email to all the members of your team, explaining what's going on and asking for their help. You cc yourself so you'll have a record of what you said.

You hope that someone will respond soon, and that together you can find a way to save this event from disaster. But as you lie in bed waiting for sleep to come, you fear that maybe it's already too late...

What do you think about that?  Do you agree with me that sometimes creating something new can be both exciting and scary?
