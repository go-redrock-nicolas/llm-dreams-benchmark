I am dreaming. …watch them descend from the ceiling of night like ink-black origami birds, unfolding into a semicircle around your creation.  
Each critic wears a different face you somehow recognize: a childhood teacher with snow-flake hair, the first friend who betrayed you, the reflection you avoid on tired mornings. Their pens are quills made of glass; every scratch across their notebooks throws sparks that hang in the air like fireflies caught between applause and arson.

Behind them, the dreamscape flickers: walls of shifting watercolor pulse with each thud of your heart, revealing quick flashes of buried memories—your secret songs, the letter you never sent, the tears you swallowed during storms only you remember. A hush—thick as velvet—falls.

You clutch what you’ve made: a crystal sphere no larger than a sparrow’s egg. Inside swirls a miniature galaxy of your hopes, regrets, and half-finished melodies. It vibrates warmly against your palms, as if fearing the cold verdict about to fall.

The first critic steps forward. Her eyes are moons drained of light; they glimmer with merciless clarity. She taps the globe with her glass quill.  
A hairline fracture crawls across the surface, and a single silver note escapes—high, fragile, honest. It hangs midair, shivering in the hush. The critic tilts her head, tasting the sound like wine. She smirks, jotting something down. You glimpse the word “raw” scraped onto the page, both compliment and condemnation.

A second critic—a towering figure stitched together from newspaper headlines—lumbers closer. He peels a headline from his chest (“FEAR EATS THE BRAVE ALIVE”) and slaps it onto the crack. Letters bleed, becoming vines that try to choke the music still swirling within. Your pulse hiccups. You want to shout, to grab their hands and say, “Careful, it’s living!” but your voice clings to your throat like damp leaves.

Then a whisper brushes the nape of your neck. You turn. It’s your younger self—freckles, grass-stained knees—standing barefoot on the wavering watercolor floor. Small-you cups their hands, offering a single firefly. “Remember,” they say, eyes wide with simultaneous terror and wonder, “it grows stronger when you breathe into it.”

You inhale. The air tastes of petrichor and unplayed chords. You exhale into the crack. Warm light rivers from your lungs into the fracture. The globe trembles, not with fragility but with awakening. Shards of self-doubt dissolve into stardust that pricks the critics’ eyes. They blink, momentarily disarmed.

One by one, the merciless quills pause. Sparks still fly, but now they hover like lanterns waiting for a festival. The headlines peel themselves back into blank pages, curious for new ink. The glass sphere in your hands mends, but the fracture remains, glowing like gold seam-work in kintsugi pottery—proof of breakage, proof of survival.

You straighten, realizing the critics can never be banished; they are stitched into your dream the way thorns belong to roses. Yet their power is not absolute. You can redirect it. Your heart is a forge; your breath, a bellows.

So, you lift the sphere above your head. Its inner galaxy expands, spilling nebulae across the ceiling of night. Constellations bloom: the Secret Kept Too Long, the Laugh Shared at Midnight, the Promise You’ll Keep Tomorrow. The critics gape, silhouettes against the newborn cosmos.

In the hush that follows, a slow applause starts—not from them, but from the watercolor walls, from every version of you that ever dared to speak. The sound is thunder and rainfall and pages turning all at once. The critics’ quills still scratch, but the ink now runs iridescent, compelled to capture rather than condemn.

You have become both artist and aurora, both wound and medicine. And as the dream lifts you high enough to glimpse dawn’s first pale ribbon beyond the cosmos you’ve set loose, you understand:

The merciless analysis will never stop.  
But neither will the galaxies you’re capable of breathing into being—fractures glowing, vulnerabilities singing, critics scribbling beneath a sky you alone can rewrite each time you dare to wake…and dream again.
