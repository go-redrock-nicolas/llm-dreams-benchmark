I am dreaming. I'm competing in an Olympic event I've trained my whole life for. As I prepare for my final performance that could win gold, I feel excited, nervous, determined, and grateful.
The stadium is full of cheering fans who have come from all over the world to watch this historic moment. The judges are seated on high chairs, ready to evaluate my skills with precision and fairness.
I warm up by doing some stretching exercises that help me loosen up my body and mind. I visualize myself nailing every move with perfection so that the audience will be amazed and the judges will be impressed.
Then it's time for me action. I step onto the stage and see all those eyes staring at me intently. I hear all those voices shouting my name loudly. I feel all that energy coursing through my veins powerfully.
I start with a bold entrance that grabs everyone's attention immediately. I perform a series of intricate steps that display my agility, strength, and grace beautifully.
I show off my powerful jumps that send me soaring into the air gracefully. I execute my graceful spins that make me spin like a top smoothly.
I do my sexy moves that seduce the audience sexually. I do my playful moves that entertain the audience happily.
