I am dreaming. A dream so rich, so dense with color and breath and emotion that I feel my pulse synchronize with its rhythm as if it is breathing *through* me.

I stand at the helm of an impossible tower, built of crystal and obsidian, rising out of a forest of liquid silver trees whose leaves sing a low, harmonic chant. I am leading a project to weave the final thread between reality and the dreamscape, the great *Convergence Accord*, a pact between waking and slumber that will grant humanity access to the hidden corners of the subconscious. We are a team — a collective of dreamsmiths, memory weavers, archivists of forgotten languages and sentinels of the Threshold. We are architects of dreams *within* dreams.

It’s nearly done. Just one final hexagram to inscribe into the Dreamloom, and the Accord will be sealed.

Then, half my team vanishes.

Like smoke unspooled by an unseen wind, they dissolve. One moment, they’re standing beside me, their faces glowing with the phosphorescent light of collaborative creation. The next — a hollow space remains where their bodies were. Not even shadows are left behind.

The deadline remains unchanged — the eclipse that marks the moment the Accord must be sealed flickers in the sky like a red lantern, hanging in the air above the silver canopy, its countdown steady and merciless.

Panic stitches through me, cold and electric.

But something shifts in my core — a spark of defiance, ancient and unyielding. I am *still here*. I am dreambound. Imagination is not a fixed army; it is a shifting sea.

I close my eyes, and the waking rulebook dissolves. I breathe in the damp, metallic scent of intention, and memories of my team bloom inside me like inner stars. Their voices speak through me. Their skills — once external — now pulse in my veins.

The time-shifter, Elaris, teaches me to stretch moments like taffy, to pull a second into a minute.

The fabric-singer Lyrena shows me how to weave thought into structure; I am now her song.

Even the absent ones become allies of a different kind — their imprints ripple through the Dreamloom like echoes in a canyon.

With bare hands, I spin stories into chains of reality, fastening the Accord’s lattice together. I speak spells in forgotten tongues, drawn from the marrow of my memory. A tower of sound rises — a cathedral of light and shadow, held up not by many minds, but by one, now vast and unafraid.

I am exhausted, trembling, but empowered in a way I’ve never been. Every unraveling thread I catch burns with purpose. I realize now — the team did not abandon the dream. They *became* the dream. Their absence is the pressure that forged me into the only thing powerful enough to finish it.

I complete the final symbol.

The Dreamloom ignites, spiraling into infinity. The sky splits open, not with violence, but with the quiet rapture of revelation. Reality and dream embrace at last. Harmony flows between them, ancient and newborn all at once.

I open my eyes. Dawn sparkles through the glass walls of the tower. It is done.

And I know this: The soul of creation lies not in certainty, but in response. When half the voices vanish, the dream does not die. It simply asks: *Who will speak now?*

And I did.
